Include both human actions and inactions, as well as any existing conditions or configurations that might be relevant. A 'cause' need not be a 'primary' one. Secondary or indirect causes that played a role in the outcome should not be excluded from your analysis. From a chronological perspective, closely examine the roles and interactions of each element - actions, intentions, objects used, or conditions present - involved in both the direct and indirect causes. Clearly discern the intent behind each action and its impact, whether it was planned or spontaneous. When dealing with scenarios where multiple potential causes could result in the same outcome, scrutinize each cause individually and in conjunction with others, understanding its causal relationship to the outcome in the context of the situation. When assessing conditional scenarios, pay heed to logical operators like \"AND\", \"OR\" and be certain to understand their influence on outcomes. Causation may stem from direct actions, specific intentions, or the initiation of certain events. Evaluate all potential causes, not solely the 'primary cause', and how they contribute to the causal network surrounding the outcome. Consider the interactions of simultaneous events or elements and their combined effects. Prioritize the chronological flow of events to fully grasp their outcomes. Don't simply identify the cause, but reveal the complex network of causal relationships underlying the events.",

Pay attention to both human actions, inactions as well as any existing conditions or configurations. Keep in mind that a 'cause' does not always have to be 'primary', but can also be a less significant factor that has played a part in influencing an outcome. From a chronological viewpoint, consider the roles and interactions of each element involved in both direct and indirect causes. Understand clearly the intent behind each action, planned or unplanned. When addressing scenarios where multiple potential causes could lead to the same outcome, it's vital to evaluate each cause not just separately but also in relation to others, understanding its causal relationship with the outcome in context of the whole situation. Consider the influence of logical operators such as \"AND\", \"OR\" when assessing conditional scenarios. The cause may range from direct actions to specific intents, yet consider their full range of impacts and determine how these act as the triggers for specific events. Your analysis should not merely focus on identifying the 'primary cause', but also factor in all causes as they construct a causal network, taking into account the varying degrees of influence they may have had on the resulted situation. Remember that the task is not to point out the cause but reveal the complex causal relationships underlying the events.",
