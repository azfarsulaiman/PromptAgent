The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
I have a bed, a table, a microwave, two cars, and a stove. How many objects do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have five objects: a bed, a table, a microwave, two cars, and a stove.

The model's prediction is: 2.

<2> 
The model's input is:

I have a lettuce head, three carrots, a yam, a cabbage, and a garlic. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is:

<3> 
The model's input is:

I have a raspberry, three clarinets, an apple, a nectarine, four oranges, a flute, a peach, and an accordion. How many fruits do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have six fruits: a raspberry, an apple, a nectarine, four oranges, and a peach.

The correct label is: 8
The model's prediction is: 4.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model's response fails because it doesn't correctly count the number of objects. Specifically, it incorrectly counts "two cars" as a single object rather than two.

Reason: The prompt has directed the language model to focus on "causal attribution" which is a very specific type of questioning dealing with cause-and-effect relations but the task given is a straightforward counting exercise which doesn't require, nor connect with, causal explanation or reasoning.

<2> 
In this example, the outcome is again incorrect because of a miscount of the items. The model viewed "three carrots" as one object instead of three separate ones.

Reason: Once again, the prompt leads the model to an incorrect answer due to the disconnect between the task, which is to count the number of items, and the context from the prompt, which is to answer questions related to cause and effect.

<3> 
This example too suffers from an incorrect count of items, with "four oranges" being viewed as a single object.

Reason: The prompt's directive for the language model to handle "causal attribution" is misleading as the question doesn't deal with any causes or effects but rather requires simple counting of items.

To improve this prompt:

1. The directive in the prompt should match the type of tasks/questions being asked. If the task is to count objects, include that in the prompt.
   
2. Mention explicitly in the prompt to consider every item as an individual object for purposes of counting, especially when multiple quantities of the same item are mentioned.

3. Ensure the prompt isn't misleading or off-topic. The tasks here involve counting and not cause-effect relationships so avoid mentioning unrelated concepts like 'causal attribution'. The prompt should be clear and related to the task at hand. 

A possible improved prompt could be "Count the number of individual objects mentioned in the given details." This directly instructs the model what the task involves allowing it to provide more accurate responses.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The first question is wrong because the model counts each type of vegetable as one unit, overlooking the number of vegetables indicated before some types. For example, it likely counts "three cabbages" and "three garlics" as one each instead of three each, resulting in two missing from its count. The prompt does not clarify that it needs to account for quantities of each item in its response.

<2>
In the second question, the error stems from the same issue. In counting objects, the model fails to acknowledge the quantity indicated by the words "two microwaves" and "two chairs," counting each of these as one, thus underestimating the total number of objects.

<3>
For the third question, the model initially gives the correct count in its text response, "You have four musical instruments - one flute and three drums." but then its numeric prediction contradicts this, as the model states that the prediction is 3 which suggests that the model's text recognition, and its numerical recognition are not entirely synchronized. The model is not properly recognizing or processing the numeric quantities present in text.

The prompt could be improved in the following ways:
1. Clearly specify that the task involves accurately counting objects described in the input, including quantities specified for each type of object.
2. Instruct the model to recognize and process numerical quantities that are explicitly stated in the input.
3. Ensure consistent synchronization between the numerical and textual components in the model's response.
4. Address the model's task of responding to 'causal attribution,' which is not relevant to the example questions provided. Clearly, specifying that the task is 'answering questions that involve counting objects' may improve the model's accuracy in responses.

gradient:
<1> 
The model seems to have misinterpreted the quantity of some of the vegetables. The prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" does not cater well to the task of counting objects or quantities. From the task, it is clear that the model needs to multiply the quantity of each vegetable. However, a causal attribution task involves understanding causes and effects, not quantities.

<2> 
Again, the model seems to have miscounted the number of objects supplied in the question. The prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" may have misled the model, as it seemingly does not require any understanding of causes or effects, but rather plain object counting. 

<3> 
In this example, the model once again fails to correctly count the number of fruits. As with the first two examples, the prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" seems inappropriate. The task requires counting skills and the identification of fruits from a list of mixed objects, which involves general knowledge and not an understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.

In all three examples, the model misinterpreted because the prompt led it to perform a task of causal attribution rather than count the items listed in each question. Worse yet, the examples don't contain any cause-effect relations, making the model confused and deliver an inaccurate response.

Based on these reasons, aspects that can improve the prompt include:
1. Making a more specific prompt catered to the task. The prompt should be something along the lines of "Count and classify the objects in a list" if the task is about counting and identifying specified items.
2. The prompt should clarify how it wants the model to handle the different objects, such as distinguishing fruits or vegetables from other objects.
3. The prompt should instruct the model to consider quantity when applicable. Ensure quantities are properly multiplied when counting items.
4. Eliminate causality since there is no cause-effect situation in the provided examples.

Wrong Example 1 Analysis: 
The model's response is actually correct by saying that there are six objects in total. It seems to have misunderstood the correct label (6) which is interpreted as its prediction (1).

Wrong Example 2 Analysis: 
Similar to the first example, the model's response is correct as there are two animals. The model's prediction (1) seems detached from its actual answer and the correct label (2). Again, it might be a programming error, or the model lacks the ability to accurately interpret quantity expressions.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Instead of using a broad prompt like counting objects, specify the type (e.g., "Count the number of furniture pieces" or "Count the number of animals").
2. Include an instruction to directly relate the answer to the "label" given as it seems the model does not tie its "prediction" to its answer.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Accurately count and answer questions about objects including specified quantities in the input

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Accurately count and answer questions about objects including specified quantities in the input
I have a plum, three oranges, three ducks, an apple, two raspberries, a grape, a nectarine, and a strawberry. How many fruits do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 fruits.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 9.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Accurately count and answer questions about objects including specified quantities in the input
I have a goat, two cats, a trumpet, a rabbit, a pig, two snails, a bear, a fish, a dog, and a chicken. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 8 animals.

The correct label is: 11
The model's prediction is: 8.

<3> 
The model's input is:
Accurately count and answer questions about objects including specified quantities in the input
I have an accordion, a yam, two clarinets, a garlic, a cauliflower, a cabbage, and a flute. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have three vegetables: a yam, a garlic, a cauliflower, and a cabbage.

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 3.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong example analysis: 
In this example, the model failed to account for the "three" before "oranges" and instead counted it as a single fruit. This resulted in the total count being one less than the correct count. This error shows that the language model failed to understand that numbers before an object indicate quantity. 

<2> Wrong example analysis: 
In this instance, the model incorrectly counted the animals present, once again failing to understand that the word "two" before "cats" and "snails" indicated a quantity of two each. Moreover, it wrongly identified the "trumpet" as an animal, showing a shortcoming in the model's ability to distinguish between objects.

<3> Wrong example analysis: 
In this example, the model responded inaccurately by saying "You have three vegetables: a yam, a garlic, a cauliflower, and a cabbage," and provided four vegetables in the list. This indicates that the model failed to keep consistency in counting the number of objects.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Specify that numbers before objects need to be factored into counting: This would help the model correctly count objects when the quantity is explicitly stated before them.

2. Indicate that the model should only count items relevant to the question: For instance, when asked how many animals are present, the model should ignore non-animal objects.

3. Emphasize on accurate counting: The prompt should place more emphasis on counting accurately and appropriately to ensure consistent results, and it should avoid contradicting counts in the same response. 

4. Make clear that it should distinguish different categories of objects: The prompt should guide the model to distinguish between different categories of objects, like animals and musical instruments.

A revised prompt could be: "Accurately count and answer questions about specific categories of objects, factoring in any specified quantities mentioned in the input. The model should exclude objects outside the questioned category and maintain accuracy and consistency while counting."

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model seems to have overlooked the fact that "two garlics" should be counted as two individual vegetables rather than one. It has only counted the number of vegetable types instead of considering quantity as well. 

<2> 
Here, the model made a similar mistake. It has counted the "five accordions" as one entity or type of instrument, whereas it should consider the specific quantity mentioned. 

<3> 
Again, the model failed to acknowledge the quantity specified for multiple similar objects, i.e., "three microwaves" and "four lamps", which should contribute to the total count as seven objects, not two. 

<4> 
The same issue as in the previous examples occurs here, where the model does not give enough weight to quantities specified for the items, causing it to underestimate the actual number of vegetables (i.e., "three carrots" and "two onions" are undercounted).

Improvement Aspects:

1. Add clarification in the prompt about considering the quantity of every object mentioned. The AI model needs to understand the difference between types of items and the total number of items.
2. Direct the model to pay special attention to plural markers and quantities specified before items. This should ensure that the model comprehends the need to count "five accordions" as five separate pieces for example.
3. Include sentence examples in the prompt that specify quantities with the items, helping the model learn and understand the proper way to count.
4. Encourage the model to systematically break down the sentence, piece by piece, to ensure that nothing is overlooked, particularly in terms of quantities tied to specific items.
5. Request the model double-check the arithmetic before producing the final answer. 

The improved prompt could look like: "Carefully read and count all the objects mentioned in the input, considering any specified number attached to them. Answer questions about the objects based on their total number, not just types."

In this example, the model seems to interpret the prompt as needing to identify the number of distinct types of items (in this case fruits), rather than the total count of items. It only counts each type of fruit once, regardless of how many of each are mentioned.

<2> 
Similarly to Example 1, the model only counts each type of vegetable once, regardless of the mentioned quantity. The model does not recognize the quantities of each vegetable listed in the question, leading to an incorrect total count.

<3>
In this scenario again, the model only identifies the number of different types of instruments, not taking into account the quantity of each type, leading to an incorrect total.

The model keeps to its pattern of counting only distinct items. Here, it determines the count based on the number of different animals but does not take into account the quantity of each animal species.

<5> 
Just like the previous examples, the model only considers the types of animals, not the number of each type, resulting in another incorrect total count.

The recurring issue in these examples is the model's misinterpretation of the prompt to mean count the types of items or animals rather than the total quantity of them. The prompt's ambiguity leads the model to misinterpret the task. Improvements to the prompt could include specifying whether the desired total should consider quantities of each item/animal and clearer instructions to make sure the model understands exactly what it is supposed to calculate.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The question asks about musical instruments, and the input contains seven distinct types of musical instruments. However, it also mentions "two snails," which are animals, not items or musical instruments. Since the prompt asks the model to calculate the total number of distinct "items or animals," the model might misinterpret the "two snails" as part of the item count, leading to a wrong answer.

Wrong Example 2:
The question asks about animals, where all mentioned creatures are animals and there are ten different species. However, it says "two snakes," which the model might not have interpreted as an additional count of a distinct animal, leading to an incorrect answer. 

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Specify whether duplicates or repeated items/animals should be counted separately or counted as a single distinct item.
2. Define what constitutes a distinct entity more explicitly, for instance, stating that each different species of animal or type of item is counted as a distinct entity regardless of how many are present within a species or type.
3. Clearly differentiate between counting items and animals, as some queries may involve both. It might help to ask the model to differentiate and separately count distinct items and distinct animals when both are present in the input.
4. Instead of mentioning "formulate an answer that matches the numerical label," you might mention "the model should count the distinct items or animals and provide the count as its output" for clarity.
5. Include guidance on how to handle ambiguous situations where it is unclear whether the type or quantity of item/animal should be considered for the count. For example, clarify whether "two snakes" should be counted as one distinct entity (species of snake) or two (individual snakes).

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Calculate the total number of distinct items or animals mentioned in the input and formulate an answer that matches the numerical label.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Calculate the total number of distinct items or animals mentioned in the input and formulate an answer that matches the numerical label.
I have a violin, three trombones, two snails, an accordion, a piano, a trumpet, and a clarinet. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
I have a total of 6 musical instruments.

The correct label is: 8
The model's prediction is: 6.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Calculate the total number of distinct items or animals mentioned in the input and formulate an answer that matches the numerical label.
I have a pig, a chicken, a duck, a fish, two snakes, a bear, a rabbit, a frog, a cat, and a cow. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have 10 animals.

The correct label is: 11
The model's prediction is: 10.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
The question asks about musical instruments, and the input contains seven distinct types of musical instruments. However, it also mentions "two snails," which are animals, not items or musical instruments. Since the prompt asks the model to calculate the total number of distinct "items or animals," the model might misinterpret the "two snails" as part of the item count, leading to a wrong answer.

Wrong Example 2:
The question asks about animals, where all mentioned creatures are animals and there are ten different species. However, it says "two snakes," which the model might not have interpreted as an additional count of a distinct animal, leading to an incorrect answer. 

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Specify whether duplicates or repeated items/animals should be counted separately or counted as a single distinct item.
2. Define what constitutes a distinct entity more explicitly, for instance, stating that each different species of animal or type of item is counted as a distinct entity regardless of how many are present within a species or type.
3. Clearly differentiate between counting items and animals, as some queries may involve both. It might help to ask the model to differentiate and separately count distinct items and distinct animals when both are present in the input.
4. Instead of mentioning "formulate an answer that matches the numerical label," you might mention "the model should count the distinct items or animals and provide the count as its output" for clarity.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question is about the total number of musical instruments, not the number of distinct types of instruments. However, the prompt seems to have led the model to count only the types rather than the total number. This could be why the model's response ("I have a total of 10 musical instruments") is lower than the correct label (13). Here, the prompt doesn't account for quantities of similar items, causing an undercount.

<2> 
In this example, the model's response was once again lower (7) than the correct label (12). The reason is similar to the first example. The model counted only the type of instruments, not incorporating the quantity of multiple similar items into the total count.

<3> 
Like the first two examples, the problem lies with the model only counting distinct types of vegetables. It did not account for multiple quantities of the same vegetables. Hence, the model's response was 4, which falls short of the correct label, 8.

Overall, it seems the recurring issue is the mismatch between the task's objective (total count of items or animals) and the model's interpretation due to the current prompt. The model interprets the task as counting distinct items or animals rather than considering quantities.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Specify that the task requires the total count of items or animals, including multiples of the same type.
2. Make it explicit that the answer should consider the quantity of similar items.
3. Remove the term "distinct" from the task description to avoid confusion.
4. Provide an example to demonstrate how to handle inputs that include multiple counts of the same item or animal.

<1> 

Question: I have a fridge, a cauliflower, a stove, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have? 

Wrong answer: You have 2 vegetables (1 cauliflower and 1 potato).

Model's prediction: 1.

Analysis: It seems like the model misinterpreted the prompt, focusing on calculating the individual types of vegetables rather than the total number of vegetables specified. The model should have focused on counting the quantities of specific items mentioned in the input (cauliflower and potato in this case) which are in the category of "vegetables". 

<2> 

Question: I have three fish, a cat, three dogs, a bear, a duck, a cow, three mice, a snail, and a rabbit. How many animals do I have? 

Wrong answer: The total count of animals mentioned in the input is 14.

Model's prediction: 14. 

Analysis: The model here may have failed to accurately compute the total count of all animals mentioned in the input. It appears to have miscounted or overlooked some animals from the input. 

Prompt Improvement:

1. Clarity - The prompt needs to be clearer about specifying that the count should be a total cumulative count, not a count of types of items or animals. For example, "Calculate the cumulative total of all individual items or animals mentioned in the input, including multiples of the same type."

2. Emphasize on the Categories - The prompt should clarify that the categories or groups matter when counting. For instance, "Consider different categories like vegetables or animals while computing the total count."

3. Unambiguous - Ensure the prompt is unambiguous about the task and where the model needs to focus. For example, "Formulate an answer that matches the total cumulative count of individual items or animals mentioned, and not the count of types of items or animals."

4. Task Specific Guidance - Guide the language model's numerical computation by including specific instructions about including all items in a specific count, such as: "Count individual instances of each item or animal, regardless of the category they belong to, and provide the total number." 

By adopting the above improvements, the model should be better equipped to accurately and correctly respond to the given input by providing the correct total count of items or animals therein.

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the first example, the model seems to misunderstand the concept of multiple quantities. It appears to count each named item as a single entity, regardless of the quantity in which they appear. This is evident in the model's failure to account for the four lettuce heads mentioned. 

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the second example, similar to the first, the model again fails to account for the "four peaches" as a quantity of four separate items. This suggests the model struggles to identify numerical references before nouns and associate them with multiple quantities of the same type.

<3> Wrong Example Analysis:
The model miscounts the animals in the third example. There are seven animals in total, but the model only counts six. This hints that the language model might be misunderstanding or misidentifying certain words as animals or failing to process all the individual entities mentioned.

Prompt Improvement:
Based on the analyses, the prompt can be improved by:
1. Emphasizing the importance of noting numerical figures that precede a noun, as they indicate quantity.
2. Encouraging the model to correctly identify the category of the named entity (animal, fruit, vegetable, etc.).
3. Asking the model to count each unique entity, taking into account both the quantity associated with it and the category it belongs to.
4. Suggesting the model to recount if the overall count of entities doesn't match the sum of the separate quantities.

A possible improved prompt could be:

"Carefully identify each entity mentioned in the input and its associated quantity, considering numerical figures that precede nouns. Classify each entity into their correct category. Sum up the quantities of the same type to determine the total count. If the overall count of entities doesn't match the sum of the quantities, recount. Provide an answer that matches the total numerical count of the asked category."

In the second example, similar to the first, the model again fails to account for the "four peaches" as a quantity of four separate items. This suggests the model struggles to identify numerical references before nouns and associate them with multiple quantities of the same type.

<3> Wrong Example Analysis:
The model miscounts the animals in the third example. There are seven animals in total, but the model only counts six. This hints that the language model might be misunderstanding or misidentifying certain words as animals or failing to process all the individual entities mentioned.

Prompt Improvement:
Based on the analyses, the prompt can be improved by:
1. Emphasizing the importance of noting numerical figures that precede a noun, as they indicate quantity.
2. Encouraging the model to correctly identify the category of the named entity (animal, fruit, vegetable, etc.).
3. Asking the model to count each unique entity, taking into account both the quantity associated with it and the category it belongs to.
4. Suggesting the model to recount if the overall count of entities doesn't match the sum of the separate quantities.

A possible improved prompt could be:

"Carefully identify each entity mentioned in the input and its associated quantity, considering numerical figures that precede nouns. Classify each entity into their correct category. Sum up the quantities of the same type to determine the total count. If the overall count of entities doesn't match the sum of the quantities, recount. Provide an answer that matches the total numerical count of the asked category."

Question: "I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?"

Wrong Answer: "You have a total of 3 musical instruments."

Correct Answer: "You have a total of 4 musical instruments."

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The question asked the model to count the total number of musical instruments.
2. The model was supposed to count the drum, piano, accordion and trombone, which amounts to four musical instruments.
3. However, the model answered with three, indicating that it must have mistakenly excluded one of the musical instruments while counting.

Potential Problems and Reasons:
1. The prompt was unclear about how specific items should be categorized and counted. It told the model to count all the items or animals mentioned, which likely led to confusion about what qualifies as an "item" and what does not.
2. The prompt does not instruct the model to consider the context of the objects for counting. The model is not informed to differentiate items based on their nature or category, which in this case, was musical instruments among other items.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. The prompt should be clearer about what constitutes an "item" or "animal". It could include instructions for the model to understand and differentiate items based on their nature or category. Additionally, it should specify whether the model should count all mentioned items, or only certain kinds based on context.
2. The prompt could include instructions for the model to pay attention to any conditions or qualifiers in the question, such as "musical instruments" in this case. 
3. The prompt should include instructions for the model to count distinct types of items separately if they fall under different categories. 
4. Finally, provide improved instructions to focus on the tasks related to counting and differentiated counting based on the question by understanding the main task within the sentence itself.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this question, the model undercounted some of the fruits mentioned in the string. The error seems to be with three bananas and two oranges. The model likely considered each fruit type as one item, ignoring the specific quantities mentioned, resulting in a total of 9 instead of the correct total of 11. 

<2> 
The error in the second question seems to be similar to the first one. The model correctly recognized all items but missed the fact that there are four tables and two stoves. This suggests that the model is not correctly considering the specific quantities for each item. 

<3> 
Again, the model failed to account for the specific quantities of distinct items mentioned, such as three tables and three microwaves, counting them as one item each instead. 

In all these examples, the model failed to recognize and correctly count the specific quantities mentioned for distinct items or animals, suggesting there may be a problem with the prompt's wording or a limitation in the model's comprehension capabilities. 

Based on these reasons, the improvement aspects for the prompt can be:

1. The prompt needs to stress on the significance of considering the specific quantities mentioned for each item. 
2. Phrase the prompt in a way that clearly indicates the difference between the total number of items and the total quantity of items - the latter being the correct thing to calculate.
3. Specify in the prompt to pay attention to numerical indications that may adjust the 'quantity' of individual items or animals, to ensure the model understands it not just count distinct items, but quantities as well. 
4. Incorporate some examples in the prompt to make it easier for the model to understand the task. 
5. If model limitations are the issue, consider training it on more examples of tasks that require quantity calculations to improve comprehension and execution.

gradient:
<1>
In this example, the prompt fails to clearly instruct the model to account for the specific quantities mentioned for each animal. It only outlines that the total quantity of distinct animals should be calculated, but does not necessarily imply the need to consider specific quantities attached to each animal. This is evident in the example where the model counts each type of animal as 1, not taking into account that there were five chickens mentioned.

<2>
Like in the first example, the prompt didn't lead the AI to recognize and count the multiple items, such as the 'four bananas' and 'two peaches'. Clearly, the prompt doesn't inform the model to consider any numerical values stated before the items.

One main reason why the model seems to be making errors is that it falsely interpreted the prompt's instruction "considering the specific quantities mentioned for each" as counting each distinct item or animal once regardless of the number attached to it.

To improve the prompt, the following aspects can be addressed:

1. Clarify the need to multiply individual counts by the quantities mentioned before the animals or items.
2. Specify that the term "distinct items or animals" does not mean that the model should assign a count of '1' to each regardless of preceding quantities.
3. Simplify the language to ensure that there is no confusion in the model's interpretation.
4. Rearrange the instruction to follow the logical order of the task: first identify the items, then identify and count the quantities. 

An improved version of the prompt could look as follows:

"Determine and count the distinct items or animals stated in the input. Ensure to correctly account for the specific quantities mentioned for each item or animal. The final count should include these quantities. Then, provide a response that matches this total numerical count."

My current prompt is:
Calculate the total quantity of distinct items or animals stated in the input, considering the specific quantities mentioned for each, and formulate a response that matches the numerical label.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Calculate the total quantity of distinct items or animals stated in the input, considering the specific quantities mentioned for each, and formulate a response that matches the numerical label.
I have three chickens, three mice, a goat, a donkey, a bear, a cow, a duck, and a cat. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have 10 animals.

The correct label is: 12
The model's prediction is: 10.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Calculate the total quantity of distinct items or animals stated in the input, considering the specific quantities mentioned for each, and formulate a response that matches the numerical label.
I have a cauliflower, a cabbage, four onions, and a head of broccoli. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 6 vegetables.

The correct label is: 7
The model's prediction is: 6.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The prompt instructs the model to count the "total quantity of distinct items or animals..." In this particular input, the model seems to have only considered the unique animals mentioned (chicken, mice, goat, donkey, bear, cow, duck, cat), counting 1 for each and disregarding the specific quantity of the chickens and mice (3 each). This misunderstanding of the prompt instruction led to an incorrect prediction of 10 animals instead of the correct 12 (3 chickens, 3 mice, and 1 each of goat, donkey, bear, cow, duck, cat).

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
Similar to the previous example, the model continues to have a misunderstanding regarding the distinctions between unique items and quantities. Again, the model only appears to count individual types of vegetable (cauliflower, cabbage, onions, broccoli), treating them as 1 each regardless of the actual mentioned quantity. The model's failure to incorporate the 4 onions results in an incorrect prediction of a total of 6 vegetables instead of the correct count which is 7 (1 cauliflower, 1 cabbage, 4 onions, 1 broccoli).

Improvement Aspects:

1. Clarity in Instructions: Rather than using the term "distinct" items or animals, it might be more effective to use the phrase "total number of" or "aggregate of" to clarify that the model should be taking into account the provided quantities of each item or animal.
   
2. Quantity Emphasis: Reinforce the importance of considering specific quantities mentioned for each item or animal. It should always be stressed that counting should be based not on the types of items or animals alone, but it should always respect the count mentioned for each.

3. Prompt Simplification: Simplify the prompt as much as possible to avoid confusion. Adding too much detail or complex sentence structures can confuse the model.

Improved Prompt:
"Add up the total number of items or animals stated in the input based on the specific quantities given for each. Provide a response that matches the resulting sum."

gradient:
<1> 
The question asks to calculate the specific quantities mentioned for each item or animal and the model got 13 while the correct answer is 14.

The error happened because the model did not add every single fruit separately. It seemed to have counted the fruits that are mentioned with a specific number, (e.g., "three peaches," "four apples") but it failed to count each singularly listed fruit as "one." In this case, it did not account for the single "blackberry," "plum," "orange," "nectarine," "raspberry," "grape," and "banana."

<2> 
Similarly, for the second example, the model did not add each object separately. It calculated the items mentioned with numbers (e.g., "three toasters," "four microwaves," "four lamps") but failed to add the singularly mentioned items such as "oven," "couch," "fridge," "table," "bed," "stove," and "chair."

The problem with the prompt is that it instructs to count "the specific quantities mentioned for each item or animal," which may have made the model zero in on instances where a number is explicitly stated, misinterpreting singular items without a number as non-specific and consequently disregarding them.

Based on these reasons, the following aspects can improve the prompt:
- Specify in the prompt that if no quantity is mentioned for an item or animal, it should be considered as one.
- Make clear that the model should tally all items and animals mentioned, regardless of whether they are accompanied by a specific numerical value.
- The prompt might also clarify that both singular and plural items or animals should be accounted for in the quantity count.

<1> 
The question in the example is:
"I have a dog, a stalk of celery, two heads of broccoli, a mouse, a yam, three cabbages, an onion, two garlics, a cauliflower, a carrot, a lettuce head, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?"

The model's response is: 
"The total number of vegetables you have is 12."

However, the correct answer is 14, not 12. 

Step by step analysis:
The input contains both vegetables and non-vegetables (dogs and mice). In the prompt, the focus is on counting every "item or animal". Here, "item" being generalized may have led the model to count individual items and not the quantity in question. 

The model failed to account for the specific quantities of some of the vegetables, namely the 2 heads of broccoli and 2 garlics, hence the response of 12 instead of 14.

Reasons for Failure:

1. Broad Scope: The prompt was not specific to counting only vegetables in the input sentence, hence the model may not have focused on tabulating only the vegetable count.

2. Misinterpretation of Quantity: The prompt might not have been clear enough to emphasize on the fact that each "specific quantity" of items should be considered as more than one. As such, the model counts the 2 heads of broccoli and 2 garlic, as single entities.

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Specify what to Count: If we want it to only count specific items (like vegetables), we should clarify this in the prompt.

2. Clarification on Quantity: We need to make it very clear in the prompt that the language model needs to understand that when the specific quantity is mentioned for an item, it should count that as the specified number.

A possible better prompt would be:
"Identify and count the specific quantities mentioned for each vegetable in the input to find the total sum of vegetables. Make sure to recognize when multiple items are mentioned and count them accordingly. Deliver a response that accurately reflects this summed number."

"The total number of fruits you have is 16."

The correct label is: 17

1. Problem: Lack of Clarity in Attribute Counting
Reason: The prompt asks the language model to count the quantities mentioned, however, it does not specify whether each fruit variety should be counted as one (as it's done with "a peach") or if it should be counted according to the specific quantity mentioned (as is the case with "five grapes").

2. Problem: Singular and Plural Confusion
Reason: The language model may have misunderstood the quantity due to the singular and plural forms in the input. If the model started counting from "a peach, an apple ..." as one, when it encountered "five grapes", it might have counted it as one group of grapes, thus causing an error.

3. Problem: Failure to Distinguish Specific Quantities
Reason: The prompt does not instruct the model to discern specific numbers from general quantities. This can lead to confusion in accurately identifying the quantity.

To improve the prompt, consider the following:
1. Specify in the prompt to count each item once unless it's mentioned with a specific quantity.
2. Explicitly instruct the model to understand the difference between singular and plural items and that each item counts as one unless stated otherwise.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the input, count all objects while paying close attention to any specific quantities attached to them, and then accurately answer questions based on the total count of each object, not just their types.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Carefully analyze the input, count all objects while paying close attention to any specific quantities attached to them, and then accurately answer questions based on the total count of each object, not just their types.
I have a mouse, a stove, a snail, and a rabbit. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 3 animals: 1 mouse, 1 snail, and 1 rabbit.

The correct label is: 3
The model's prediction is: 1.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Carefully analyze the input, count all objects while paying close attention to any specific quantities attached to them, and then accurately answer questions based on the total count of each object, not just their types.
I have an oven, a lamp, four beds, three stoves, a microwave, a car, and a couch. How many objects do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 11 objects.

The correct label is: 12
The model's prediction is: 11.

<3> 
The model's input is:
Carefully analyze the input, count all objects while paying close attention to any specific quantities attached to them, and then accurately answer questions based on the total count of each object, not just their types.
I have a stalk of celery, a carrot, a bear, two heads of broccoli, three goats, a garlic, a lettuce head, two onions, a cabbage, a yam, two cauliflowers, a potato, and a fish. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
There are 10 vegetables in total: 1 stalk of celery, 1 carrot, 2 heads of broccoli, 1 garlic, 1 lettuce head, 2 onions, 1 cabbage, 2 cauliflowers, 1 yam, and 1 potato.

The correct label is: 13
The model's prediction is: 1.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1> Wrong Analysis: 

Question: 
"I have a mouse, a stove, a snail, and a rabbit. How many animals do I have?"

Model's Response: 
"You have a total of 3 animals: 1 mouse, 1 snail, and 1 rabbit."


Reason:
The model correctly answered the question, identifying and providing the count of the animals listed in the input. However, the prompt should not have been included as part of the input. This could have confused the model’s prediction mechanism, causing it to output the answer as 1. The prompt is only an instruction and not part of the contextual factors needed to answer the question. 

<2> Wrong Analysis:

Question: 
"I have an oven, a lamp, four beds, three stoves, a microwave, a car, and a couch. How many objects do I have?"

Model's Response:
"You have a total of 11 objects."

Reason:
In this case, the model misunderstood that "three stoves" and "four beds" carry specific quantities. This reflects that the prompt was unclear about how to handle multiple quantities of the same object. Again, the confusion is likely from the inclusion of the prompt in the input. 

<3> Wrong Analysis:

Question: 
"I have a stalk of celery, a carrot, a bear, two heads of broccoli, three goats, a garlic, a lettuce head, two onions, a cabbage, a yam, two cauliflowers, a potato, and a fish. How many vegetables do I have?"

Model's Response: 
"There are 10 vegetables in total: 1 stalk of celery, 1 carrot, 2 heads of broccoli, 1 garlic, 1 lettuce head, 2 onions, 1 cabbage, 2 cauliflowers, 1 yam, and 1 potato."

Reason:
The model miscounted the number of vegetables and failed to recognize multiple pieces of the same type of vegetable individually. In addition to this, the instruction (prompt) in this case was part of the input again which led to incorrect prediction.

Improvements for the Prompt:

Based on the analyses, the following improvements can be made:

1. The prompt needs to be clearer on how to handle multiple quantities of the same object, as it currently doesn't specify this situation.

2. The prompt should be used only as an instruction, not part of the input to avoid confusion for the model.

3. The prompt should outline ways of classifying and distinguishing between different groups, as in Example 1 where animals and non-animal objects were mixed.

4. The prompt should not lead to a specific numerical prediction before completing the classification, counting, and consolidation of data to avoid any bias in the predicted results. 

5. The prompt needs to specify that the model should keep track of every object individually, even if they are of the same type.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question is asking for the total number of fruits, which is 2. The model's response is accurate content-wise but the prediction it made is incorrect, stating it as 1. The prompt may have misled the model to count the number of types of objects instead of the actual total count. 

<2> 
The prompt is not sharp enough to ensure that the model always counts multiple quantities of certain objects (like three ovens and four chairs). The model seems to be treating them as one object each, which led to the undercount. 

<3> 
The prompt failed to guide the model in properly categorizing objects in the sentence, causing it to misidentify a strawberry as not a fruit, leading to the wrong prediction. 

<4> 
In this case, it appears as if the model's prediction only counts one type of animal as 1 despite there being multiple different animals. This suggests that the prompt may not be clear enough in differentiating an object's type from its quantity. 

<5> 
Similar to example 2, the model made an error when counting the total quantity for animals due to multiple quantities of fish in the sentence. This again suggests that the prompt lacks clarity in indicating the necessity to count multiple quantities of the same object separately.

Potential improvements for the prompt:

1. Emphasize on counting the exact quantity of each object type: Clarify that if there are two or more of the same type of object, they should be counted individually, not as a single object.

2. Improve instructions on categorizing objects: Explain that all objects should be correctly categorized based on the question being asked, not just counted. For instance, strawberries should be recognized as fruit in corresponding questions

3. Clarity on distinguishing an object's type from its quantity: Specify that the total count requires the number of individual objects, not the number of types. 

4. Reiterate the importance of total counts: Clearly state that it is the total count of objects in the context of the question that is important, not an abstract or separate element count. 

By making these changes, the prompt will have a clearer purpose and direction, reducing the chance of incorrect model predictions.

Question: I have a peach, a cauliflower, a cabbage, and a plum. How many fruits do I have?

Wrong answer: You have 2 fruits (1 peach and 1 plum).

Reason: In this instance, the model's answer isn't actually incorrect. However, despite correct comprehension, the system marked the prediction as '1' when it should have been '2'. This might be due to a tracking issue during encoding or decoding the output.

<3>

Question: I have a couch, a bed, a table, and a stove. How many objects do I have?

Wrong answer: You have 4 objects in total: 1 couch, 1 bed, 1 table, and 1 stove.

Reason: Again, the model's answer is correct, but it was marked with the wrong prediction score of '1' instead of '4'. This may indicate an issue with the scoring system or output interpretation, not the prompt itself.

Improvements:

1. Include Specific Examples: The prompt could benefit from added examples to guide the model's understanding. It would help illustrate how to approach different objects and categories.

2. Define Objects and Categories: A brief definition or a set of rules about what constitutes an object and how they can be classified into different categories.

3. Clarify Quantity Importance: The prompt could also emphasize the importance of considering individual quantities for accurate tabulation.

1 chicken
1 pig
1 snake
1 goat
1 bear

Adding them all up, you have 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 3 = 12 animals.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The issue here stems from the model's inability to identify "two" as an actual quantity relating to the objects. The prompt encourages a count of the mentioned objects, but the model does not sufficiently distinguish the number of each object. It merely recognizes both rabbits and two bears as individual objects instead of two distinct units of each object. 

Wrong Example 2:
Again, it seems like the model only counts the individual instances when objects are mentioned rather than taking into account the actual quantity of objects specified. In this particular case, the model only counts two types of animals (bear and fish) instead of recognizing these as two individual units. 

Wrong Example 3:
This model miscounts the total number of objects as it fails to consider each individual item appropriately. The instructions mention counting the individual objects, but it seems the model may overlook the numerical adjectives that denote the count of some objects. 

Improvements:

1. More precise instructions. The prompt should stress the importance of interpreting the quantities mentioned in the text and the numerical adjectives to get an accurate count of the objects.

2. The prompt might include key phrases to inform the model which information to focus on, such as "pay attention to quantities" or "count based on mentioned numbers".

3. The prompt can incorporate explicit examples since models often benefit from having explicit instructions with examples that demonstrate what is expected from them.

4. A hint regarding the context can be beneficial in helping the model predict better. In many cases, models can infer from context even if the instruction is not entirely clear.

If the task's main aim is to count the total number of each type of item, then the prompt should be worded more specifically towards this, for instance, 'Identify and count each item and their quantities mentioned in the given information.' With additional specifications mentioned, the model can then be guided to detect not just the individual objects, but also their quantities distinctly.

gradient:
<1> Reasoning:
The model performed the calculation correctly for the total number of fruits [1 (grape) + 2 (bananas) = 3], however, it incorrectly predicts that there are only two types of fruit. This confusion could be a result of the prompt's lack of clarity on whether to count objects individually or to categorize them based on their types.

<2> Reasoning:
The model again got the calculations correct but mixed up the specific types of fruits present with the total number of fruits. The model predicted just '1', perhaps interpreting the question as asking for the different types of fruits present.

<3> Reasoning:
The model miscalculated the total number of vegetables. It added the different types of vegetables (potato, yam, onion, garlic, cabbage, broccoli, celery, lettuce, carrot) and came up with 10. However, it didn't account for the quantities of each type (four garlics and three stalks of celery). The prompt might need clearer instruction about considering the specific quantities of each object.

<4> Reasoning:
The model's count missed out the 'stalk of celery' and only counted carrot, potato, yam, and cauliflower, resulting in a total of 4 instead of 5. The model's ability to identify objects might need improvement to accurately decipher what it should count.

<5> Reasoning: 
The model gave the correct total number of fruits but predicted '1', again possibly confusing the number of different types of fruits with the total amount. Clear specifications would help.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Specify whether the model should count the types of objects or the individual quantity of objects.
2. Make it clear that the model should consider the quantity of each type of object while performing calculations, not just the type.
3. Enhance the model's understanding of language to identify individual objects accurately.
4. The prompt could be improved to explicitly state the task, such as "Perform calculations to determine the total number of individual objects mentioned in the text".
5. It may be helpful to include training on similar prompts where the difference between "types" of items and "numbers" of items is clearly distinguished.

While the model correctly identifies and counts all the animals, it seems to overlook the numeral adjacent to some animals, causing it to mistake in counting four frogs as one instead of four.

Reason why the prompt could cause this:
The prompt asks the model to perform calculations, but it does not specify the kinds of calculations to perform. This could cause ambiguity, leading the model to misinterpret what's being asked.

<2>
Question context:
The question provides a list of vegetables and requests the model to calculate the total number of vegetables. 

Model's mistake:
The model correctly calculates the total number of vegetables.

Reason why the prompt could cause this:
While the model gets this example correct, the prompt's direction is still ambiguous, making the task execution reliant on the model's interpretation.

<3>
Question context:
The question provides a list of fruits and requests the model to calculate the total number of fruits. 

Model's mistake:
The response from the model is accurate and matches the correct label.

Reason why the prompt could cause this:
Again, the prompt's direction is vague, making the task execution reliant on the model's interpretation, even though it gets this example correct.

<4>
Question context:
The question provides a list of animals and requests the model to calculate the total number of animals. 

Model's mistake:
The model makes an error in calculating the total number of animals. It counts all of the animals but makes a mistake in counting four rabbits as one.

Reason why the prompt could cause this:
The prompt doesn't specify that the model needs to reckon with the number of units next to each animal, causing potential misunderstanding.

Aspects for improving the prompt:
1. Specify the task clearly: Instead of asking the model to "perform calculations," instruct it more precisely, like "count meticulously and tally up the total number of specific objects," if that's the main intention.
2. Clarify the importance of numbers next to objects: Explicitly instruct the model to take into account the numbers given next to each object as they play a vital role in the overall count.
3. Encourage detailed validation: If possible, encourage the model to check its work or to double-check the calculations it performs. This measure will help increase the precise conclusion and lower the error rate.
4. Identify specific categories: Make clear that the calculations should be based on the asked category, like animals, vegetables, etc. The model needs to filter out the objects irrelevant to the task.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The question specifically asked for the count of vegetables yet the prompt did not guide the model to focus on the "type" of item even when it's specifically asked for. As a result, the model treated each vegetable as a single distinct item rather than combining them based on their common category (type).

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
Similar to the first example, despite the question specifically asking for the count of animals, the model did not combine them based on their common category due to the instructions in the prompt.

<3> Wrong Example Analysis:
Unlike the first two examples, this question was looking for a general count of all objects. The model did not include 'an oven' in its final count possibly because the prompt did not clarify whether the indefinite article 'a' or 'an' preceding an item should be interpreted as representing a quantity of 1.

Improvement areas for the prompt:

1. Clarify that the model should be prepared to focus on the specific category (type) of item as needed by the context of the question. 

2. Specify in the prompt that while each mentioned item differs, they may also belong to a common category which might be the focus of calculation in some questions. 

3. Make it clear in the prompt that the model should consider 'a' and 'an' as representing a quantity of 1. Also, delineate that specific numerical values preceding items should be taken into account during calculation. 

4. Teach the model to understand the context, not just the specific words. This will help to interpret the questions more accurately rather than solely relying on the keyword mentioned in the prompt. 

5. For a more robust understanding, ensure the model is also trained to handle questions that refer to the same objects differently, for example, categorically or individually. 

6. Finally, add that if the question asks for a specific group (like vegetables or animals), then the counting should be focused on that group only, considering actual quantities of each item in that group.

gradient:
Example 1:

The model failed to correctly identify the number of musical instruments. The model seemingly did not recognize the implicit reference to quantity in "two accordions, three clarinets," and added everything as individual items (one accordion, one clarinet, one piano, etc.) leading to the total of nine instead of the correct total of eleven.

Example 2:

The model failed to correctly identify the number of fruits. The prompt asked model to consider every named item as distinct and count based on their quantity. It seems like the model counted everything as individual items overlooking the fact that "two raspberries" represented two items, not one. It may also have failed to categorize nectarines as a fruit, leading to the incorrect count.

Reasons that lead to wrong answers:

1. The inability to correctly interpret and act upon phrases indicating quantity.
2. Problems with item categorization (e.g. identifying which items should be considered within a particular category like "fruits" or "musical instruments").

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clearer that numbers before an item identify its quantity and must be taken into account in the total.
2. Specify that the task may involve understanding categories (e.g. what items fit into categories like "fruits" or "instruments").
3. The instructions can be clearer about the need to understand and use the given information contextually, rather than treating each item as a separate and distinct item regardless of information suggesting otherwise. 
4. Emphasize the need for the model to understand and implement basic counting principles.

In this example, it seems that the model has not correctly added up the total number of objects: 1 table, 1 lamp, 3 stoves, 3 toasters, 3 couches, 1 fridge, 1 bed, and 1 car. This sums up to 14 but the model gives the answer 13. It could be due to the model failing to always effectively manage large quantities and maintain an accurate count. 

<3>
In this example, the model incorrectly counted the total number of musical instruments. The correct total should be 11, but the model predicted it as 10. This again indicates trouble in counting when there are multiple items with different quantities.

The prompt asks the model to focus on the quantity of items rather than their types. However, the following aspects can be improved:

1. Clear Specification: The prompt should clarify that the task is a simple counting task, where the purpose is to total up all quantities, regardless of the item's type.
2. Enumeration Importance: The prompt needs to underscore that the model must account for multiple occurrences of an item. The presence of a number before an object increases that object’s count by that very number.
3. Bridging Misunderstandings: The phrase "Assume any named item refers to a distinct object" may mislead. It can be revised to make it clear that each mention of the same object type is a different "instance" of that object, and its quantity contributes to the total tally.

The model's prediction is: 13.

<3> 
The model's input is:
Perform calculations according to the provided information, focusing on counting each mentioned item based on their quantity, rather than their type. Assume any named item refers to a distinct object and its quantity should be included in the total calculation.
I have three flutes, a drum, a piano, two clarinets, an accordion, two trombones, and a trumpet. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 10 musical instruments.

The correct label is: 11

The model's response is: 
You have 2 objects: 1 chair and 1 microwave.

The correct label is: 2
The model's prediction is: 1.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reason for Incorrect Answer:

The model misinterpreted the task and specifically counted musical instruments only, while the prompt actually instructs to count all named items, not just those of a certain type. According to the prompt, the chicken also needed to be included in the total count.

<2> Reason for Incorrect Answer:

The model undercounted the number of objects. From the provided answer, the model only counted the chair. It appears that the model might have failed to recognize "microwave" as a countable object.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Reinforce that all items mentioned should be counted, not just certain types: The model seems to misunderstand that certain types or categories of items should not be singled out for counting. It would be beneficial to emphasize in the prompt that all mentioned items, regardless of their type or category, should be included in the count.

2. Clarify that each named object counts as an individual object: The prompt may need to be clearer that every single item mentioned is an object to count. The model may have trouble discerning that certain items (e.g., a microwave) are countable objects, so instructing the model explicitly that any named thing is considered an object may help improve accuracy.

3. Provide explicit instruction about quantities: While the current prompt states that a preceding quantity multiplies the count of an object, the language model may benefit from additional clarity. Reinforce that when a quantity is provided, it should be used to determine the number of that specific object mentioned.

4. Re-emphasize the task goal: The model may need to be continuously reminded of the task at hand, which is to count all objects mentioned.

5. Distinct distinction regarding item identification: While the current prompt mentions that the task is not to identify or sort items by type, the model may benefit from a reaffirmation that the objective is pure enumeration and not categorization or identification.

By revising the prompt to address these areas, the language model's comprehension and execution of the task should improve.

gradient:
Example 1:

Step 2: The model excludes the non-fruit items (stove, toaster, and microwave), as the question specifies the count of fruits, which was not the task required by the prompt.

Step 3: It sums up the number of fruits mentioned, but overlooks the fact that "four nectarines" should multiply the count by 4.

Reasons for wrong answer: The model is incorrectly categorizing items based on their type, when the prompt specifically instructed not to do so. Additionally, it is not correctly accounting for the quantity of nectarines mentioned.

Example 2:

Step 1: The information given names a musical instrument (clarinet) and vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) along their quantities

Step 2: The model incorrectly categorizes a clarinet as a vegetable which is again deviating from the prompt's instructions of not identifying or sorting them by type.

Step 3: It correctly counts the number of vegetables (carrots and cauliflower)

Reasons for wrong answer: The model is incorrectly categorizing items by their type, in this case considering a clarinet as a vegetable.

gradient:
<1> 
The question requires counting total "fruits" but the current prompt instructs the model to count all individual things, regardless of their type, which leads to the wrong answer. The model counted all the items as unique objects without differentiating them by categories. Therefore, the confusion arises when the user asks for the count of a particular type of items, in this case, "fruits". The model interprets this as a request to count all objects and not just the 'fruits'.

<2>
In this situation, the model miscalculated the number of fruits by missing the multiplier provided before certain fruits. While it identified the distinct fruit items, it did not account for the multiplier effectively. This misinterpretation resulted from the prompt's inadequate emphasis on the multiplication of the count of objects when a quantity is mentioned prior.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify that the model can identify and count objects according to specific categories or types when asked.
2. Emphasize the importance of considering implied quantities attached to objects via multipliers correctly.
3. Incorporate a reminder that the model needs to leverage contextual clues in the question, for example when the user asks for how many of a specific type of object they have. 
4. Include in the prompt that the model should not only count but accurately interpret the question's demand.

I have a donkey, a dog, a mouse, a frog, a pig, a fish, two chickens, a cat, a rabbit, and a goat. How many animals do I have?

Model's Response: You have a total of 10 animals.

Correct Label: 11

Problems:

1. Misunderstanding of Quantity Descriptors: The language model seems to have misunderstood the quantity descriptor of "two" for the chickens. In this context, "two" multiplies the count of that item (chicken), making it two separate entities. While the model correctly accounted for each other single animal, it may not have registered "two" as a distinct quantity, leading to a shortfall in the total count.

2. Ignoring Instances with Specified Quantities: In connection to the first problem, the model might have overlooked the numerical quantifier in front of "chicken". The prompt explicitly tells the model to account for the multiplied count of a particular item when a quantity descriptor is present.

Improvements:

1. Emphasize Quantitative Descriptors: The prompt could be clearer on how to handle specific quantities mentioned before an item. It can stress the importance of paying careful attention to numerical descriptors and how they amplify the count of a specific object.

2. Cite Examples: Give a clear example of how to count when a numerical descriptor is applied to an object, which may prevent the model from overlooking such instances.

3. Clarify Instruction: Define the task as "individual entity counting", stressing that the model should count every item as separate entities and numeric modifiers should be counted separately(in this case counting "two chickens" as 2, not 1). 

4. Avoid Over-complication: The prompt might be over-complicated and could be simplified. The information about not sorting or categorizing appears unnecessary and might confuse the machine.

<1> Incorrect Example Analysis:

The question asked was "How many fruits do I have?" According to the prompt, the model should not categorize items by their nature or type; however, it seems like the model is, in fact, categorizing the items as fruits and non-fruits. It identified 7 items as fruits and ignored the other items, thus resulting in an incorrect answer.

<2> Incorrect Example Analysis:

In this scenario, the question asked was "How many musical instruments do I have?" The model was supposed to count all of the listed items, but it instead classified the items into musical instruments and non-musical instruments categories. As a result, the model only counted the items classified as musical instruments, leading to an incorrect output.

<3> Incorrect Example Analysis:

In this case, the main issue is the model's misinterpretation of the prompt's rules. Despite the prompt stating that a number before an object multiplies its count, the model has neglected this rule and counted some items incorrectly. It accurately counted 4 accordions, but it seems to have counted the two drums as only one, resulting in an incorrect total.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

- The task needs to make it explicitly clear that categorization of the objects according to their nature, usage, or type is not necessary, regardless of the context in the question. Clarify that the question phrasing does not change the basic task of counting all given objects.
- Further emphasize the rule that a number before an item multiplies the number of that particular item and ensure the language model executes this correctly.
- The instructions could use more concise language and a clearer directive, as the extensive verbosity may lead to confusion for the model.
- Include examples within the prompt to show that the rule applies notwithstanding the way the question is otherwise phrased.
- Use bullet points or numbered steps to make the task requirements easier to comprehend and follow.

Simply calculate the pure number of objects based on their immediate quantities. Your answer should reflect the overall count of all mentioned objects without considering their type.
I have a drum, a plum, a blackberry, a trumpet, and an orange. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 2 musical instruments (1 drum and 1 trumpet).

The correct label is: 2
The model's prediction is: 1.

I have two clarinets, a trumpet, two violins, a trombone, two drums, a piano, a flute, and four accordions. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
The total number of musical instruments you have is 13. 

Calculation:
2 clarinets + 1 trumpet + 2 violins + 1 trombone + 2 drums + 1 piano + 1 flute + 4 accordions = 13 musical instruments.

The correct label is: 14
The model's prediction is: 13.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Incorrect Example Analysis:

The question asked was "How many fruits do I have?" According to the prompt, the model should not categorize items by their nature or type; however, it seems like the model is, in fact, categorizing the items as fruits and non-fruits. It identified 7 items as fruits and ignored the other items, thus resulting in an incorrect answer.

<2> Incorrect Example Analysis:

In this scenario, the question asked was "How many musical instruments do I have?" The model was supposed to count all of the listed items, but it instead classified the items into musical instruments and non-musical instruments categories. As a result, the model only counted the items classified as musical instruments, leading to an incorrect output.

<3> Incorrect Example Analysis:

In this case, the main issue is the model's misinterpretation of the prompt's rules. Despite the prompt stating that a number before an object multiplies its count, the model has neglected this rule and counted some items incorrectly. It accurately counted 4 accordions, but it seems to have counted the two drums as only one, resulting in an incorrect total.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

- The task needs to make it explicitly clear that categorization of the objects according to their nature, usage, or type is not necessary, regardless of the context in the question. Clarify that the question phrasing does not change the basic task of counting all given objects.
- Further emphasize the rule that a number before an item multiplies the number of that particular item and ensure the language model executes this correctly.
- The instructions could use more concise language and a clearer directive, as the extensive verbosity may lead to confusion for the model.
- Include examples within the prompt to show that the rule applies notwithstanding the way the question is otherwise phrased.
- Use bullet points or numbered steps to make the task requirements easier to comprehend and follow.

Model's Response: The total number of objects mentioned is 13.

Correct Label: 14

Analysis:

- Lack of Adaptability: It seems like the model failed to adapt to the nuances of the data input, particularly the quantities involved. It appears that the model didn't comprehend the prompt's emphasis on considering the stated quantities preceding an item as a multiplication factor while calculating the total count of items. Resultantly, it undercounted the total number of objects.

- Poor Comprehension of Multipliers: The model might have not correctly understood how the numbers work as multipliers. This can lead to errors when calculating objects with a quantity of more than one, as in the case of "three toasters", "two couches", or "three ovens".

- Formulaic Errors: Given the calculation error, it could also signify that the model misunderstood the formula stated: that the count of an item equals one unless a different quantity is specified. 

To improve the prompt, the following aspects can be considered:

1. Clearer Instructions on Quantities: Create more explicit instructions regarding quantities and their role as multipliers for the items. Ensure the model understands that if an item is preceded by a number, that number must be used as a multiplier to calculate the total count of that particular item.

2. Detailed Understanding of Multipliers: Develop an approach that explicitly instructs the model to compute "n" number of items when a numerical value precedes an object.

3. Improved Comprehension of Mathematical Operations: Consider refining instructions to enhance the model's understanding of mathematical operations, emphasizing quantity multiplication in the context.

Overall, the focus should be on making the prompt clearer about its task and expectations, especially regarding ‘multiple counts of the same object’.

Question: I have a fish, a bear, two frogs, five lamps, five cars, four donkeys, a duck, a snail, a dog, and a pig. How many animals do I have? 

The model's response is: You have a total of 7 animals: 1 fish, 1 bear, 2 frogs, 4 donkeys, 1 duck, 1 snail, 1 dog, and 1 pig.
The correct label is: 12 The model's prediction is: 1.

Reason:
The mistake here could arise due to the model's misunderstanding of the prompt's instructions. The model was explicitly told to count all items, not to sort them by type. However, the model was focused on classifying objects into categories (in this case "animals"), which is the opposite of what the prompt asked it to do. Essentially, the model didn't follow the instructions of treating each item as a distinct object to be counted.

Improvements:
Rephrase the prompt instructions to make them clearer and more explicit (e.g. 'count every single item, regardless of its type, without classifying or categorizing them'). Emphasize the disregard of item categories more clearly. The instructions could say, 'your only task is to focus on the total quantity of all items, not what type of item they are'. Avoid using words like 'object' as it may cause confusion regarding item categories. Use 'mention' instead. 

Also, consider simplifying the instructions to focus more on counting without any need for reaching understanding of what the items are. A simpler language and a more concise directive could help to prevent confusion. Be more explicit that any distinction made regarding the nature of the items should be disregarded (e.g., if the question is asking for only animals, ignore this and count all items).

Question: I have a fish, a bear, two frogs, five lamps, five cars, four donkeys, a duck, a snail, a dog, and a pig. How many animals do I have? 

The model's response is: You have a total of 7 animals: 1 fish, 1 bear, 2 frogs, 4 donkeys, 1 duck, 1 snail, 1 dog, and 1 pig.
The correct label is: 12 The model's prediction is: 1.

Reason:
The mistake here could arise due to the model's misunderstanding of the prompt's instructions. The model was explicitly told to count all items, not to sort them by type. However, the model was focused on classifying objects into categories (in this case "animals"), which is the opposite of what the prompt asked it to do. Essentially, the model didn't follow the instructions of treating each item as a distinct object to be counted.

Improvements:
Rephrase the prompt instructions to make them clearer and more explicit (e.g. 'count every single item, regardless of its type, without classifying or categorizing them'). Emphasize the disregard of item categories more clearly. The instructions could say, 'your only task is to focus on the total quantity of all items, not what type of item they are'. Avoid using words like 'object' as it may cause confusion regarding item categories. Use 'mention' instead. 

Also, consider simplifying the instructions to focus more on counting without any need for reaching understanding of what the items are. A simpler language and a more concise directive could help to prevent confusion. Be more explicit that any distinction made regarding the nature of the items should be disregarded (e.g., if the question is asking for only animals, ignore this and count all items).

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Perform calculations based on the given information, particularly counting the individual objects mentioned
(2) Perform calculations according to the provided information, focusing on counting each mentioned item based on their quantity, rather than their type. Assume any named item refers to a distinct object and its quantity should be included in the total calculation.
(3) Perform calculations as per the information given, paying special attention to counting each individual thing regardless of its type. Every named item counts as a unique object and if a quantity is mentioned before this object, it multiplies the count of that object, contributing to the total sum. Your task is to count the total quantity of all objects mentioned, not to identify or sort them by type.
(4) Your task is to calculate the total number of items mentioned in the information given. Each named item should be treated as a distinct object to be counted, irrespective of what type of item it is. Pay particular attention to quantities mentioned before each item - this quantity is a multiplier, increasing the count of that specific item. Do not focus on identifying or sorting items by type; the only goal is to count the total number of all objects mentioned, no matter their kind or category. Remember, every item named, even those that may seem less obvious, should be part of the total count.

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the prompt might have led the model to the wrong answer because it misunderstood the instructions or misunderstood the context of the task. The instructions clearly state to count all named objects without focusing on categorization or type. However, the model answered the question "How many musical instruments do I have?" by only counting explicitly-labeled musical instruments, missing out on the trumpet which was listed among the items. This suggests that the model might have been biased towards exclusion due to the question's specific reference to a category—"musical instruments".

<2> 
In this case, it appears the model did follow the instructions from the prompt, treating each named item as a distinct object to be counted, but it seems to have misunderstood how to treat items with explicit quantities. In the list, there are “3 yams” and “2 cabbages” mentioned specifically, meaning each of these sets should contribute 3 and 2 items to the total count, respectively. The model, however, appears to have counted each set as 1 object. This indicates the prompt wasn't effective enough in instructing the model about handling quantities as multipliers.

Based on these reasons, improvements to the prompt could include:

1. Emphasizing the need to classify objects based purely on their mention, not by their categories or types, irrespective of the question's context.
2. Highlighting further the aspect of quantities acting as multipliers for the item count, perhaps with additional examples or clearer language. 
3. Incorporating a reminder that all named items must be counted individually, even if they exist in a set with a named quantity.
4. Advising the model to not make assumptions about categorization if an item category is mentioned in the question. To clarify, the presence of a category in the question shouldn’t cause the model to exclude items that could potentially fall into that category.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

The model responded wrongly by counting "three trombones" as a single item, rather than recognizing 'three' as a multiplier indicating count of similar items. The prompt failed in ensuring the model's comprehension of quantities as multipliers for establishing total count.

Wrong Example 2:

The model incorrectly counted 'orange' as a musical instrument, which means the language model is generalizing all mentioned items, irrespective of their actual category or type. While the prompt did mention not sorting items by type, the task should be limited to counting specific categories of items when the question demands it.

Wrong Example 3:

The model's prediction incorrectly stated just 1 object instead of 3. This indicates that the model wasn't able to understand 'microwave,' 'fridge,' and 'bed' as three individual items to be counted. The prompt might not have been clear enough in emphasizing that each named item should be treated as distinct objects.

Based on these analyses, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:

1. Make clear that quantities immediately before items should be treated as multipliers to calculate the total count.
2. If the question specifies a certain category of items (like musical instruments), the model should disregard objects not falling into this category.
3. The language used should make it more explicit that each named object, irrespective of its category or type, should be counted as an individual item, thus addressing the issue encountered in the third example.
4. Structuring the prompt language and semantics in a manner that reinforces the differential counting of varied objects.
5. Modify the phrases to avoid any room for over-generalization. The instruction "do not focus on identifying or sorting items by type" can be confusing and contradictory to tasks asking for certain categories of items only.

Pay particular attention to quantities mentioned before each item - this quantity is a multiplier, increasing the count of that specific item. Do not focus on identifying or sorting items by type; the only goal is to count the total number of all objects mentioned, no matter their kind or category. Remember, every item named, even those that may seem less obvious, should be part of the total count.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.

response:
<START> Your task is to calculate the total number of specified objects mentioned in the provided context. Each distinct item that's named is considered individual and unique for count, regardless of its category or kind. Remember to consider quantities mentioned immediately before each item - this quantity works as a multiplier, magnifying the count of that specific item. However, if the task specifies a certain type or category of objects, exclude items that do not belong to that category from your total count. The goal is not identifying or sorting objects by their type but to count the total number of named objects, taking into account their quantities and specific categories when mentioned. Ensure that every named item, including those that may seem less clear or explicit, contributes to the total count. <END>

   prompt: Your task is to perform calculations based on the given information, particularly focusing on counting each and every object mentioned. It's crucial to understand that every item named in the information provided is considered as an individual unit. If a stated quantity precedes an item, that action multiplies the count of the particular item. Your task solely demands the calculation of the total number of objects mentioned. Do not classify or sort items by their nature or category. Importantly, don't apply external knowledge such as categorizing items into types like fruits, vegetables, or other categories while counting. Simply calculate the pure number of objects based on their immediate quantities. Your answer should reflect the overall count of all mentioned objects without considering their type.

   prompt: Your assignment is to calculate the total count of all objects mentioned in the context given to you. Follow these guidelines:

1. Every object mentioned in the description is counted as an individual object, no matter what it is.
2. If there's a specified quantity in front of an object, that multiplies the count of that item - this means that if there are "three apples," that counts as three individual objects.
3. The goal is to calculate the total number of all objects mentioned, regardless of the phrasing or context of the question asked.
4. Do not differentiate or classify items according to their nature, usage, or type - you are not to sort them into categories of, for instance, fruits or musical instruments. 
5. Though a question may ask "How many fruits do I have?" or "How many musical instruments do I have?", keep in mind that your task remains the same - simply count all listed items, regardless of their type or categorization. 

For example, "I have three apples, a cat, and two pens. How many fruits do I have?" - your answer should be 6 because the question wording does not change the task: Count all items mentioned. Apply this guideline consistently through all your calculations. Remember, your answers should reflect the total count of all objects mentioned, not their specific categories or types.

   prompt: Your task involves performing calculations based on the details given in the text. The main focus here is the counting of individual items that are specifically mentioned. Understand that every item placed in the text is to be considered a separate unit. If a number comes before an item, it indicates the multiple counts of that particular item. You need to add these multiples to the calculated total. Your purpose is to ascertain the overall count of items referred to in the text without diving into their types. Do not apply your knowledge to classify or sort the items into categories. All you need to do is to apply simple arithmetic to give us the calculated sum of individual items, including those prefixed with numbers. The final answer should solely reflect the overall total of all named items without considering their category.

   prompt: Your assignment is to calculate the total count of all objects mentioned in the context given to you. Follow these guidelines:

1. Every object mentioned in the description is counted as an individual object, no matter what it is.
2. If there's a specified quantity in front of an object, that multiplies the count of that item - this means that if there are "three apples," that counts as three individual objects.
3. The goal is to calculate the total number of all objects mentioned, regardless of the phrasing or context of the question asked.
4. Do not differentiate or classify items according to their nature, usage, or type - you are not to sort them into categories of, for instance, fruits or musical instruments. 
5. Though a question may ask "How many fruits do I have?" or "How many musical instruments do I have?", keep in mind that your task remains the same - simply count all listed items, regardless of their type or categorization. 

For example, "I have three apples, a cat, and two pens. How many fruits do I have?" - your answer should be 6 because the question wording does not change the task: Count all items mentioned. Apply this guideline consistently through all your calculations. Remember, your answers should reflect the total count of all objects mentioned, not their specific categories or types.

   prompt: The instructions are to execute computations as per the given data, particularly focusing on counting the total number of individual objects mentioned. Each item specified in the given information is treated as a separate entity. A vital aspect to comprehend is that if a certain quantity precedes an object, that factor effectively multiplies the count of that object. Do not classify or sort items by their kind, category, or other parameters. Your role demands only the calculation of the aggregate number of objects mentioned, without any categorization considerations. If a certain numeric value accompanies an object, interpret it as a multiplier, meaning you count that object 'n' times, where 'n' is the numeric value given. Calculate the cumulative number of objects based on their given quantities, and do not bring in extra knowledge or assumptions. Your response should exhibit the collective count of all objects stated, regardless of their nature or type. Ensure a detailed understanding of these multipliers and their direct application in determining the total count.

   prompt: Your assignment is to count the total quantity of all items mentioned in the given information. Each specific item named, regardless of its type or category, should be counted as an individual entity. If there's a specified quantity mentioned for an item, use that as a multiplier for that particular item's count. Do not engage in categorizing or identifying items based on their characteristics. The only objective is to quantify all named items, no matter their kind or category. Even those items that might seem less significant should be included in the final count. Avoid making distinctions between items; your task is only to count the total mentions without interpreting the nature of the items.

   reward: 0.4800 | Q: 0.4800 | uct: 3.1004 | cum_rewards: []
   prompt: Your task is to tally up the absolute total of all items mentioned in the information provided. Regard each item pointed out as an individual entity to be added to your count, regardless of its version or category. Ensure you give special importance to any quantities delineated before an item, as this is a multiplier that inflates the count of that specific item. The primary goal is to calculate the all-inclusive count of all named objects, not to distinguish or classify them based on their kind or classification. Even if the question references a particular category, count all items mentioned, irrespective of whether they specifically appear to fit into that category or not. Every item stated, regardless of its immediate obvious classification, should be included as a distinct part of the total count. The quantifier mentioned before any item must not just pile up the item types, but should multiply the individual count of that item. For instance, if 'three apples' are mentioned, it contributes three items to the total count, not one. Your responsibility is to provide a count of all named items, not to make assumptions about category distribution or sorting based on any categorical indication present in the question.

   prompt: Your task is to calculate the total number of specified objects mentioned in the provided context. Each distinct item that's named is considered individual and unique for count, regardless of its category or kind. Remember to consider quantities mentioned immediately before each item - this quantity works as a multiplier, magnifying the count of that specific item. However, if the task specifies a certain type or category of objects, exclude items that do not belong to that category from your total count. The goal is not identifying or sorting objects by their type but to count the total number of named objects, taking into account their quantities and specific categories when mentioned. Ensure that every named item, including those that may seem less clear or explicit, contributes to the total count.
