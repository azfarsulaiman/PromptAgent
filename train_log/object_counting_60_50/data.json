Keep track of the exact count of each item, with a special focus on situations where specific numbers are stated. Now consider an individual item or a category, taking into account only those items that pertain to the context. For items that appear in multiples or in groups, ensure you count each one as a distinct unit and do not regard the group as one unit. This implies that if there are four drums, it should be counted as four separate items, not one. Similarly, three trombones mean three individual items. After noting every individual or multiple item, sum up the total count. Then, provide a step-by-step explanation of the counting methodology you employed during this process, being sure to detail how you handled grouped or multiple items.",
