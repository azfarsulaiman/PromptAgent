I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Abigail assuming that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line does not necessarily mean she assumes the tennis player is playing tennis. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the given wrong example, here are the potential issues:

1. Scope of Understanding: The prompt asks to "Answer questions about causal attribution", but then asks to identify the relationships between two assumptions (premises and hypotheses) and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. These two tasks aren't synonymous; Causal attribution relates to determining the cause of an event, whereas entailment requires analyzing logical relations between statements.

2. Vocabulary Ambiguity: Causal attribution might not indicate entailment to the model since they are different concepts. The language model may not be capable of correctly interpreting the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis due to this vocabularic ambiguity.

3. Lack of Context: The prompt does not provide clear instructions on how the task relates to causal attribution, resulting in misunderstanding the nature of the task itself.

Based on the aforementioned issues the following improvements can be done:

1. Align Task with Prompt: The prompt should be more reflective of the task. If the aim is to test entailment, the prompt should instruct the model to analyze logical relations between statements.

2. Avoid Vocabulary Misconceptions: Causal attribution and entailment are different concepts. To avoid misunderstandings, the prompt should clearly specify the concept of entailment.

3. Provide Clarified Instructions: Be explicit in instructing the model on the nature of the task and how it should respond, including how it should relate the concept of entailment with the given premises and hypotheses.
   
4. Incorporate Related Examples: The prompt could provide an example to illustrate the expected form of the answer before mentioning the options, helping the model understand the task better.

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.

Wrong Answer Reason: The model chose "non-entailment". It seems to be caught up on the particular details in the premise and hypothesis. The model might not successfully abstract from the concept of “a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna” to “a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.”

<2> 
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.

Wrong Answer Reason: The model incorrectly chose "entailment", assuming that if Joseph suspects Isabella learns something, then Isabella actually learns it. The model's response indicates a lack of understanding in the potential discrepancy between someone's suspicion and reality.

Premise: Ava suspects that Charlotte sees that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down. Hypothesis: Ava suspects that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down.

Wrong Answer Reason: The model incorrectly chose "non-entailment" despite the premise and hypothesis being identical. This indicates a potential issue with the model’s ability to recognize identical patterns of information.

<4> 
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. Hypothesis: William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right.

Wrong Answer Reason: The model is unable to discern the difference between Emma’s assumption about William’s belief and William’s actual belief, thus incorrectly choosing "entailment". It is committing the same mistake as seen in example 2, does not recognize the potential discrepancy between someone's assumption and reality.

Improvements to Prompt: 
1. Add examples of what you consider to be "entailment" and "non-entailment".
2. Provide clearer instructions specifying the difference between an assumption, suspicion, and actual fact.
3. Consider simplifying the language or sentence structure to avoid misinterpretation.
4. Provide guidance on how abstract thinking should be incorporated in model’s responses.
5. Implement training that assists the model in recognizing identical patterns of information.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The first issue with the prompt is that it doesn't clearly specify what type of causal attribution the model is supposed to address. Causal attribution refers to the process of identifying the causes or reasons for particular behaviours or events. The given prompt does not clarify if the model should be identifying causal attribution in human behaviour, scientific phenomena, or in a literary context. This ambiguity might be the reason why the language model incorrectly inferred entailment in the premises and hypotheses example.

Secondly, the prompt doesn't mention anything about entailment or non-entailment. This specific context requires familiarity with the concepts of entailment, which necessitates a prior understanding that goes beyond simple cause-and-effect relationships. When the language model attempted to handle the task, it may have understood it as an association of causal attribution, leading to an incorrect response.

Lastly, the model possibly misinterprets the whole question considering it as a simple causal attribution problem, which is not the case here. The question is not about deciphering causes behind Charlotte's or John's actions/events but it deals more with the logical consistency or inference between two statements.

Potential improvements for the prompt could include:

1. Specify the type or context of causal attribution that the model should be focusing on (e.g., human behaviour, natural events etc.).
2. Explicitly mention that this task could also involve concepts built on logical inferences such as entailment or non-entailment, and the model should be prepared for such tasks.
3. The complexity of the tasks should be mentioned in the prompts. Given the ambiguity, the model might be misinterpreting the task's difficulty level.
4. Encourage the model to pay particular attention to the full context of the question, ensuring all details are fully understood before attempting an answer.

gradient:
For Example 1:

Question Understanding:
The prompt requires the model to identify the logical relationship between two given statements, specifically an entailment or non-entailment. The first statement discusses Robert remembering Richard's assumption about a man examining his facial hair. The second statement is the assumption Richard holds. 

Model's Incorrect Response:
The model incorrectlly chose the 'non-entailment' option, implying it did not see a logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. 

Possible Reasons for Incorrect Response:
1. Misinterpretation of Scenario: The model may have been confused by the complexity of the scenario, particularly the part where Robert is remembering Richard's assumption. It might have over-complicated the relationship, subsequently failing to recognize the clear entailment.
2. Inaccurate Understanding of "Entailment": The model might have misunderstood the term "entailment", which in this scenario means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Clearer Definitions: The prompt could provide clearer explanations or examples of "entailment" and "non-entailment" to ensure the language model fully understands these terms.
2. Simplified Scenario: The scenario presented in the premise could be simplified to help the model distinguish the core elements.
3. Guided Focus: The prompt can highlight to focus on the information delivered rather than the carrier of the information, as in this case, focus on the assumption made, regardless of who is recalling it.
4. Process Explanation: The prompt could ask the model to explain its answers briefly, which can help identify where misunderstandings occur.

gradient:
Examining the Wrong Example:

In this specific example, the language model interpreted that if 'Taylor believes that Joseph knows that numerous customers are browsing for produce in a market', it necessarily implies 'Joseph knows that numerous customers are browsing for produce in a market'. However, the input was tricky as Taylor's belief doesn't necessarily equate to Joseph's knowledge, hence, it's a non-entailment.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Lack of Clarity in Context: Although the prompt asks the model to 'understand fully the context and details of each task before responding', it doesn't give explicit instructions about considering the nuances of belief vs knowledge in human behaviour, leading to the wrong inference drawn by the model.

2. Interpretation of 'Causal Attribution': The model might have mistakenly interpreted 'causal attribution' in the context of 'human behaviour' as a direct causal link, rather than a nuanced relationship involving personal perception and belief.

3. Incomplete Set of Examples: The prompt might not provide the algorithm with enough examples of potential pitfalls and complexities in interpreting the tasks.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. Clarifying Context: The prompt should explicitly ask the model to consider the individual perspectives of different individuals, their beliefs, and understandings while analyzing human behaviour.

2. Explicating 'Causal Attribution': The prompt should clearly define how 'causal attribution' is applied to 'human behaviour', emphasizing that it can involve perceptions or beliefs that may not necessarily correspond with reality.

3. Providing Nuanced Examples: The model could benefit from a variety of examples illustrating complex situations, ambiguities, and nuances that it needs to consider, for example, differentiating between 'belief' and 'knowledge'.

4. Incorporating Inferential Reasoning: The prompt could instruct the model to not just answer based on direct entailment or non-entailment, but also consider inferential reasoning to arrive at correct logical relationships.

5. Specific Task Instructions: The prompt should contain particularistic task instructions and clearly highlight the need to be watchful for deceptive premises.

gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the model got it wrong mainly because it was not able to understand the indirect inference between the premise and hypothesis. The premise includes specific details about the boys and their clothing, while the hypothesis is a broader general statement. The prompt asked the model to see whether the premise and hypothesis entail each other, but it did not specify how to handle the mismatched level of detail between them. Although the two statements are not directly related, they can still entail each other depending on the interpretation of their meanings. For a language model, understanding such nuances can be challenging if it is not clearly guided.

<2>
In the second example, the error derived from the model's misinterpretation of the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Even though the hypothesis is essentially included in the premise, the model incorrectly inferred that they do not entail each other, perhaps because the model expected the hypotheses to be more difficult to deduce from the premises. The model should be able to analyze the inclusion relationship between hypotheses and premises.

- Based on these, the prompt could be improved in the following aspects:

1. Specificity: Instead of asking the model to handle "tasks involving logical inferences", the prompts could specify the kinds of logical reasoning the model should undertake. For instance, the prompts could specify that entailment might happen when a specific set of details from the premise are included in the hypothesis, even if the hypothesis is more general.

2. Guided Inference: The prompts could guide the model to consider entailment from different perspectives. For example, the prompts could specify that entailment could be considered from not just the 'Surface-level details', but also from 'Nuance of meaning', 'Contextual understanding of statements' and 'Inclusion relationship between hypotheses and premises'.

3. Clarification: The prompt while specifying the tasks also needs to clarify the situations where entailment does not hold.

Conclusively, a more granular, specific, and detailed prompt guiding the language model might lead to better performance.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James assumes that Taylor assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing. Hypothesis: James assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment, as the hypothesis is directly derived from the premise. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava suspects that Michael believes that an older woman is looking at herself in the mirror at a table with cosmetics. Hypothesis: Ava suspects that an older woman is looking at herself in the mirror at a table with cosmetics.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment, as Ava's suspicion that Michael believes something implies that Ava herself also suspects the same thing. Therefore, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Step 1: The question asks to identify the relation between two statements, the premise and the hypothesis.
Step 2: The model responds by selecting 'entailment' as the answer since the contents of the premise seem directly related to the hypothesis.
Step 3: The answer given is incorrect according to the correct label. 

Reasoning: The model seems to be misunderstanding the concept of entailment as it applies to this scenario. In this specific context, while the events mentioned in both the premise and the hypothesis are the same, the premise includes the factor of James's assumption of Taylor's assumption. Just because James assumes something about Taylor's beliefs doesn't make it true. Hence, although the events discussed are the same, the presence of Taylor's assumptions doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis of James's assumption.

<2> 

Step 1: The question once again asks to identify the relation between two statements – the premise and the hypothesis. 
Step 2: The model treats the premise and hypothesis as identical and again chooses 'entailment' as the answer.
Step 3: The answer given is incorrect, as indicated by the correct label. 

Reasoning: Much like the first example, the model presumes an entailment because the premise and the hypothesis describe the same event. However, it doesn't distinguish the important detail that Ava's assumption about Michael's belief doesn't entail Ava believing the same. Her beliefs aren't necessarily the same as what she suspects Michael believes, hence the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, making it non-entailment.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Emphasize about considering the foundational logic behind statements instead of taking them at face value.
2. Strengthen the definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment': Highlight that even if two statements talk about the same event or object, the context and perspectives can shift and this affects whether a statement entails another or not.
3. Add more clarification about 'non-entailment': Include an explanation that non-entailment can occur even when topic similarities are present if the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis.
4. Include explicit guidance on the nuances of entailment with respect to assumptions, beliefs etc., and how they can alter implication relationships.
5. Consider removing or revising the line "Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what," as it could potentially mislead the model to neglect the implications of who is assuming or suspecting what.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava suspects that Charlotte sees that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down. Hypothesis: Ava suspects that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down.

The hypothesis is a specific detail within the premise, but it is not guaranteed by the premise itself. Therefore, the correct answer is: (B) non-entailment 

Reasoning: 
The model fails to understand that the action or belief of a secondary character (Charlotte in this case) can also be a suspicion of the primary character (Ava). Ava's suspicion about Charlotte's observation also implies Ava's suspicion about the observation itself.

Question: 
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

The model's wrong response: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Olivia suspects a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna does not necessarily mean she suspects a human not wearing any clothes is in a room. The two scenarios are similar but not identical. 

Reasoning: 
The model cannot handle inferences involving generalization and abstraction. Even though 'a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna' is a more specific version of  'a human not wearing any clothes is in a room', the model fails to recognize the strutural similarity due to the changes in the situation details. 

Improvements: 

1. The instructions should highlight that suspicions or beliefs of one character about another's actions or observations, can count as the first character's suspicion or belief about the action or observation.
2. Instructions need to better emphasize that entailment can occur even when the hypothesis is a more general or specific version of the premise. 
3. The model needs training to understand the relationship and correlation between situations with different degrees of specificity and you could make an emphasis within the prompt on the need to spot structural similarities between scenarios.
4. The model should also be guided to deal with situations where the context or specific details change, but the overall sense of the hypothesis is still valid according to the given premise.

<START> Your task is to explore cause and effect interactions in various situations, from human behaviors to natural phenomena. Prepare to engage in logical reasoning tasks, primarily in differentiating entailment from non-entailment. Entailment is when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, whereas non-entailment arises when the premise does not assure the hypothesis. Be mindful that different characters in the premise might be suspecting or believing the same thing and that the hypothesis could be a more general or specific iteration of the premise. Always dig deeper into each task, being thoroughly conscious of its details, complexity, and unique needs. Avoid distractions caused by who states or recalls something; concentrate solely on the information presented. After deciding on an answer, present a brief justification for it to give insight into your reasoning process. Look for structural similarities between the premise and hypothesis even when they vary in specificity or context. Also, remember that a change in context or specific details does not automatically rule out entailment if the overall sense of the hypothesis remains coherent with the premise. You've got this! <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment, as James thinking that Richard understands something implies that Richard actually understands it. Therefore, the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Analyzing the above wrong example, some of the reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer include:

1. Ambiguity in the Instructions: The prompt mentions "Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what; focus on the information being relayed.", but it doesn't adequately clarify how the model should handle assumptions about what a character might think or believe. In this case, the model took James' perception as an accurate representation of reality, leading to the incorrect conclusion that James' belief entails Richard's understanding. 

2. Insight into Perception: The prompt didn’t emphasize enough that perceptions of individuals aren't the same as facts. Just because James thinks that Richard understands a scenario does not mean that Richard indeed understands it. It's an assumption based on perception.

3. Not Considering Non-Entailment: The prompt could stress more on instances where non-entailment can occur. It generalizes the concept of entailment well but does not go into specific examples or situations where non-entailment is likely to take place. 

4. Critical Thought versus Assumed Patterns: The model seems to have jumped to an assumption pattern "If Person A thinks person B understands something, then person B understands it." The prompt could do more to stress that this is not always the case.

To improve the prompt, the following aspects can be considered:

1. Define Terms: More explicitly define terms like 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', and give clear, specific examples for both. Clear definitions will help the model understand the difference between the two.

2. Emphasizing Perception: Stress more on the concept that individual’s perception or belief doesn’t constitute the facts or doesn't make them true.

3. Include Examples: Provide examples for both entailment and non-entailment in the prompt to give the model more context.

4. Avoid Assumptions: Remind the model to evaluate information critically, not to assume connections that haven't been explicitly stated in the data. Urging the model to rely more on critical thinking than on assumed patterns could help it make better decisions. 

5. Focus on Information Relay: Emphasize focusing on the information relayed, not on the person who states or thinks the information.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James assumes that Taylor assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing. Hypothesis: James assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment, as James assuming that Taylor assumes something does not necessarily mean that James himself assumes the same thing. However, in this case, the hypothesis directly reflects what James is assuming based on the given information. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The first error I see in the example is that the model incorrectly identifies an entailment relationship. This occurs despite the model stating the correct theoretical principle that 'James assuming that Taylor assumes something does not necessarily mean that James himself assumes the same thing.' Even though the model acknowledges this, it does not properly apply the principle to the premises and hypothesis at hand. Instead, the model contradicts itself by later stating that 'the premise entails the hypothesis.' This could happen due to the repetitive and indirect nature of the prompt, which could make it confusing for the model to analyze correctly.

In the second instance, the model's explanation incorrectly suggests a real-world scenario that isn't implied by the premise: 'a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.' The accuracy of this situation doesn't influence whether the premise entails the hypothesis, but the model draws attention to it. Moreover, this points to the limitations of the model focusing on specific details too much. 

Based on these observations, to improve the prompt, I would:

1. Simplify the instructions – The current prompt contains superfluous information that could potentially distract the model. As such, it could be condensed down to focus solely on the task at hand.

2. Highlight the significance of logical reasoning – The prompt should underline that analyzing the language of the premise and the hypothesis is important, but so is keeping a clear sense of entailment and non-entailment relationships. 

3. Clearly define entailment and non-entailment again – Despite these terms being defined in the prompt, the model seems to struggle with their application. Including more examples or clarifying these terms further could be beneficial.

4. Include instructions about ignoring information that doesn't contribute directly to the task – In the prompt, it could be beneficial to remind the model not to divert its attention towards unnecessary details. Prompts might work better when they are designed to keep the model's 'focus' on analyzing whether the premise can guarantee the hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because David remembers that Richard assumes something does not guarantee that Richard's assumption is true. There could be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation involved. Therefore, the premise does not ensure the truth of the hypothesis. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that Joseph believes that a farmer tends to his chores. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a farmer tends to his chores.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment because if Olivia suspects that Joseph believes that a farmer tends to his chores, then it logically follows that Olivia suspects that a farmer tends to his chores as well. Therefore, the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first example, the error arises from a misinterpretation of entailment. In this case, the statement that "David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd" does entail "Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd." The error may stem from the model's focus on checking if Richard's assumption was correct, which is not required. The task is to check entailment between the premise and hypothesis, not the truth value of the content. The prompt could more clearly specify that fact. 

Wrong Example 2:

In the second example, the error is also due to a misunderstanding of entailment. That "Olivia suspects that Joseph believes that a farmer tends to his chores" does not entail that "Olivia suspects that a farmer tends to his chores." The model wrongly inferred that Olivia's suspicions about Joseph's beliefs directly translate to her own suspicion about the farmer's chores. The prompt might not have explicitly reminded the model to analyze the roles and relations of subjects in entailment. 

In summary, the model seems not to correctly understand the task and the concept of entailment. Steps to improve the prompt might include:

1. Reemphasize that the task focuses on the entailment between the premise and hypothesis, not the truth value of the content of the statement. 
2. Clarify that entailment is the logical necessity of the hypothesis from the premise, and is not affected by personal beliefs or perceptions.
3. Include a clearer explanation of entailment and non-entailment within the prompt. Make it crystal clear that entailment means the absolute necessary truth of the hypothesis given the premise.
4. Remind the model to analyze the roles and relations of subjects in the premises and hypotheses carefully, as reshuffling of these elements could change the entailment status.
5. Finally, stress that the model should not make assumptions beyond what is presented in the premise. The model should strictly stick to the details provided in the prompt without inferring information that isn't there.

<START>
Your task involves discerning relationships between cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. An integral part of your responsibility is to differentiate between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning. Remember, the focus of your task is the logical relation between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the trueness of the details within the premises or hypotheses.

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks. 
Options: (A) entailment (B) non-entailment

The model's response is: non-entailment. The model explains that just because Thomas recognizes two boys in a specific setting does not necessarily mean they are sitting in a classroom at their desks.

Analysis:
- Ambiguity in the Premise: The problem can partly be attributed to the ambiguity in the premise. It doesn't provide clear context or setting, making judgments about entailment or non-entailment difficult. This fosters uncertainty when assessing relations between the premise and hypothesis.
- Lack of Clarity in the Prompt: The prompt does not specify how the model should handle ambiguous or unclear premises. Hence, it leads to confusion in the model's approach.
- Insufficient information: The prompt does not instruct the model to consider possibilities where there may not be sufficient information to establish an entailment.

Summary of Aspects to Improve:
1. Explicitly state in the prompt that the model should consider the strategy for handling ambiguous scenarios or premises.
2. The prompt needs to instruct the model to use a more cautious approach while deciding entailment or non-entailment when information is insufficient. 
3. The prompt should suggest that the model should consider the simplest and most likely interpretation of the premise in cases of ambiguity.
4. The prompt should also cultivate a nuanced understanding of entailment that takes into account the subtleties of language and context.
5. The prompt should carry the instruction that judgments should not be based solely on the presence of some words or phrases, but rather the overall sense, logic, and implications of the statements.

The model's input is:
Your task involves examining cause and effect relationships in various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. Your responsibility also includes distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. Remember, entailment denotes a situation where the premise's truth ensures the hypothesis' truth, while non-entailment arises when the premise cannot guarantee the hypothesis. Beware of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these do not necessarily guarantee truth. Avoid getting swayed by who states or recalls information; your focus should be on the precise details being shared. It's crucial to grasp the essence of each scenario, paying heed to its intricacies, complexity, and specialized requirements. Be vigilant about non-entailment situations, as they might not be as straightforward as cases of entailment. Challenge any assumptions that seem to present unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After you've chosen an answer, provide a brief explanation for your choice to illuminate your reasoning process.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Thomas recognizes two boys in a specific setting does not necessarily mean they are sitting in a classroom at their desks. There could be other possible locations or scenarios where Thomas observed the boys. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1>
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks. 
Options: (A) entailment (B) non-entailment

The model's response is: non-entailment. The model explains that just because Thomas recognizes two boys in a specific setting does not necessarily mean they are sitting in a classroom at their desks.

Analysis:
- Ambiguity in the Premise: The problem can partly be attributed to the ambiguity in the premise. It doesn't provide clear context or setting, making judgments about entailment or non-entailment difficult. This fosters uncertainty when assessing relations between the premise and hypothesis.
- Lack of Clarity in the Prompt: The prompt does not specify how the model should handle ambiguous or unclear premises. Hence, it leads to confusion in the model's approach.
- Insufficient information: The prompt does not instruct the model to consider possibilities where there may not be sufficient information to establish an entailment.

Summary of Aspects to Improve:
1. Explicitly state in the prompt that the model should consider the strategy for handling ambiguous scenarios or premises.
2. The prompt needs to instruct the model to use a more cautious approach while deciding entailment or non-entailment when information is insufficient. 
3. The prompt should suggest that the model should consider the simplest and most likely interpretation of the premise in cases of ambiguity.
4. The prompt should also cultivate a nuanced understanding of entailment that takes into account the subtleties of language and context.
5. The prompt should carry the instruction that judgments should not be based solely on the presence of some words or phrases, but rather the overall sense, logic, and implications of the statements.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Your task is to investigate cause and effect in different scenarios, from human actions to the occurrences in nature. Be ready to tackle logical reasoning, especially identifying entailment and non-entailment. Remember, entailment exists when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. Always take time to grasp the essence of each task, paying attention to its details, complexity, and specific needs. Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what; focus on the information being relayed. Additionally, after selecting an answer, provide a brief explanation of why you chose it, helping us understand your thought process better.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair does not guarantee that Richard actually assumes that. There could be a misunderstanding or miscommunication between Robert and Richard, making the hypothesis non-entailed by the premise.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma believes that Sophia suspects that a man with a cap and not wearing shirt is laying a wooden bench. Hypothesis: Emma believes that a man with a cap and not wearing shirt is laying a wooden bench.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis in this scenario is entailment. The premise explicitly states that Emma believes that Sophia suspects that a man with a cap and not wearing a shirt is laying a wooden bench. Therefore, it logically follows that Emma also believes the same, as her belief is based on Sophia's suspicion. Thus, the hypothesis is guaranteed by the truth of the premise.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining example 1:

The model concluded an incorrect non-entailment because it overthought the complexity suggested in the prompt's call for logical analysis. When the prompt states that "the complexity of non-entailment situations might not be as straightforward as entailment cases," the model seems to interpret this as a need to seek out uncertainty or potential misunderstanding, as it did with "there could be a misunderstanding or miscommunication between Robert and Richard." This is, however, overreading on the model's part; the key point to focus on is still that Robert's memory indicated Richard made an assumption, and nothing in the premise contradicts or undermines that.

Examining example 2:

In this instance, the model wrongfully identified entailment. This suggests that when the prompt instructs the model to "disregard personal beliefs or interpretations entwined in the scenarios," and to "be aware that the complexity of non-entailment situations might not be as straightforward as entailment cases," it misinterprets this as a directive to condense the premises down to the simplest form, losing the nuances within the original premise. Thus, it failed to differentiate between "Emma believes that Sophia suspects" and "Emma believes".

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Revise the prompt to more clearly emphasize that the model should be cognizant of every subject and clause in the premise, ensuring that no important subtleties are lost or overlooked.
2. Make it clearer that the complexity of non-entailment situations does not imply creating hypothetical or unverifiable scenarios.
3. Highlight that the model should neither simplify nor complexify the given premises or hypotheses but analyze them as-is.
4. Further clarify "disregard personal beliefs or interpretations entwined in the scenarios" to specify that the model should not assume or presuppose any unstated beliefs or views of the subjects mentioned in the scenarios.

Entailment is characterized by a premise's truth guaranteeing the validity of a hypothesis, while non-entailment signifies the inability of a premise to ensure the truth of the hypothesis. Disregard personal beliefs or interpretations entwined in the scenarios; focus on the explicit details in the premises instead. Be aware that the complexity of non-entailment situations might not be as straightforward as entailment cases. In your analysis, avoid being influenced by irrelevant information or unverifiable connections between premises and hypotheses. After finalizing your selection, articulate your reasoning through a brief explanation, thereby shedding light on your thought process.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis in this scenario is entailment. If Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium, it logically follows that Isabella indeed learns about the woman at the podium. Therefore, the premise guarantees the validity of the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

1st Example Analysis:

The question presents a premise saying that Joseph suspects Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium, and the hypothesis is that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. The model predicted this scenario as an entailment, while the correct label is non-entailment.

Reasoning for the wrong answer:
- The model misunderstands the term 'suspects' as a guarantee, while suspicion and certainty are not the same.
- The prompt seems to overlook the nuances of language, particularly verbs such as 'suspects' that indicate uncertainty.
- The words 'truth guaranteeing the validity' in the prompt might lead the model to treat 'suspects' as 'truth' in this context. It doesn't properly account for suspicious conditions, contributing to the incorrect inference.

Improvements for the Prompt:

- Make clear distinctions in the prompt about the validity and certainty of the premise. A true premise should not only be factual, but also verifiable.
- The prompt should stress more on understanding the meanings and implications of verbs in the premise. 
- The prompt should indicate that entailment requires absolute certainty emanating from the premise to establish the hypothesis, and any element of doubt or suspicion denotes non-entailment.
- The prompt needs to underline that entailment implies the information in the hypothesis is fully contained and unambiguously deducible from the premise without the need of any further assumptions. If contextual assumptions are needed to link the premise and the hypothesis then it is a case of non-entailment.
- Instead of just focusing on exclusion of personal beliefs or interpretations, the prompt should also guide the model to consider context-based indirect meanings and certainty level of the proposition.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Your task is to investigate cause and effect in different scenarios, from human actions to the occurrences in nature. Be ready to tackle logical reasoning, especially identifying entailment and non-entailment. Remember, entailment exists when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. Always take time to grasp the essence of each task, paying attention to its details, complexity, and specific needs. Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what; focus on the information being relayed. Additionally, after selecting an answer, provide a brief explanation of why you chose it, helping us understand your thought process better.
(3) Your task involves examining cause and effect relationships in various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. Your responsibility also includes distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. Remember, entailment denotes a situation where the premise's truth ensures the hypothesis' truth, while non-entailment arises when the premise cannot guarantee the hypothesis. Beware of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these do not necessarily guarantee truth. Avoid getting swayed by who states or recalls information; your focus should be on the precise details being shared. It's crucial to grasp the essence of each scenario, paying heed to its intricacies, complexity, and specialized requirements. Be vigilant about non-entailment situations, as they might not be as straightforward as cases of entailment. Challenge any assumptions that seem to present unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After you've chosen an answer, provide a brief explanation for your choice to illuminate your reasoning process.

<START> In this task, you are to analyze scenarios involving cause and effect across a broad scope of contexts. Your main goal is to understand and decipher logical relationships, with a particular focus on entailment and non-entailment. To clarify, entailment represents a situation where the absolute certainty of a premise leads to the guarantee of a hypothesis. Conversely, non-entailment signifies situations where the premise, despite being factual or probable, is incapable of providing an unequivocal affirmation of a hypothesis. While completing the task, set aside any personal beliefs or interpretations that could potentially skew understanding. Instead, give primacy to the explicit facts detailed in the premises, ensuring that you perceive and comprehend the exact meanings and implications of every term, including verbs indicating uncertain states. Note that non-entailment cases may present more complexity than entailment cases due to the absence of a guarantee for the hypothesis. Throughout your analysis, avoid associating unrelated elements or presuming unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses. You should be able to determine that an entailment scenario would necessarily entail the hypothesis with the given premise without needing any further implicit assumptions. At the completion of each evaluation, communicate your reasoning via a succinct explanation, to provide us with an understanding of your analytical process. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis in this scenario is non-entailment. Just because Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line does not necessarily mean that she assumes the tennis player is playing tennis. The assumption about the tennis player spiking the ball on the boundary line does not logically guarantee the assumption that the tennis player is playing tennis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasoning for Incorrect Example:

The logical connection between the input premise ("Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line.") and the hypothesis ("Abigail assumes the tennis player is playing tennis.") seems to be misunderstood by the model. Spiking a tennis ball would usually indicate that the player is indeed playing tennis. However, the model seems to be considering an interpretation where the tennis player could be doing this action outside of a tennis match. 

This issue might arise from the prompt's emphasis on disregarding personal interpretations. This could have lead the model to avoid making reasonable inferences based on common understanding of real-world situations. It might also stem from the direction to consider non-entailment situations which may not be as straightforward as entailment cases, leading the model to overcomplicate this rather simple entailment scenario.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify that common sense inferences are permitted: While the model should avoid assumptions based on personal beliefs or deeper interpretations not contained in the premise, it should not disregard basic, common sense conclusions that arise from the provided details.

2. Be more specific about dealing with complexity: Advise the model that while non-entailment situations might not be as straightforward as entailment cases, it should not overcomplicate entailment situations. Simply because a scenario could be complex, that doesn't mean it is. 

3. Emphasize understanding the real-world context: It might be helpful to add a statement emphasizing the relevance of understanding the real-world context of scenarios. It should make reasonable assumptions based on such understanding to correctly deduce the logical relationships. 

4. Modify the task instruction: Modify the task instruction to something like this: "Your task is to analyze cause and effect scenarios across various contexts, focusing on the explicit details and on common sense implications arising from those details. Understand the logical relationships, particularly entailment and non-entailment. Avoid being influenced by irrelevant information or unverifiable connections." 

In essence, the instructions should more clearly guide the model in distinguishing entailment from non-entailment situations, without disregarding real-world implications that arise from the given premises.

It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment because Olivia suspecting a man dressed only in a towel in a sauna does not necessarily mean she suspects a human not wearing any clothes in a room.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
For example 1, the model may be getting confused due to the potential ambiguity posed by the characteristics within the premise. The factors like "a man dressed only in a towel" and "in a sauna", might lead the model to see them as separate conditions required for entailment, ignoring the simple fact that a man in a towel in a sauna falls under the broader scope of a naked human in a room. The complex contingent conditions seem to complicate the model's understanding. 

Improvement: The prompt can further explain what entailment means. Specifically, it should elaborate on how a specific premise can still entail a more general hypothesis.

<2>
For example 2, it seems the model has drawn the wrong inference from the premise. It has correctly identified the similarity between the premise and the hypothesis but has failed to recognize that Joseph's suspicion does not necessarily correspond to factual entailment of the event. 

Improvement: The prompt can place more emphasis on the difference between perceived events and actual occurrences. Further, the prompt can also stress more on the differentiation between reported information versus inferred information.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Provide clearer explanation of entailment by illustrating how a detailed, specific premise can still entail a more generalized hypothesis. 

2. Highlight the importance of distinguishing between personal perceptions, reports, suspicions and factual events, stressing that the former do not necessarily lead to valid entailment. 

3. Clearly define entailment and non-entailment again, including clarifying examples to aid understanding and decision-making.

4. Emphasize the importance of scrutinizing all details within the premise rather than relying on perceived similarities or logical inferences alone. 

5. Encourage the model to focus on the explicit information provided rather than wasting computational resources on attempting to infer non-existent data.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Your task is to investigate cause and effect in different scenarios, from human actions to the occurrences in nature. Be ready to tackle logical reasoning, especially identifying entailment and non-entailment. Remember, entailment exists when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. Always take time to grasp the essence of each task, paying attention to its details, complexity, and specific needs. Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what; focus on the information being relayed. Additionally, after selecting an answer, provide a brief explanation of why you chose it, helping us understand your thought process better.
(3) Your task involves examining cause and effect relationships in various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. Your responsibility also includes distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. Remember, entailment denotes a situation where the premise's truth ensures the hypothesis' truth, while non-entailment arises when the premise cannot guarantee the hypothesis. Beware of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these do not necessarily guarantee truth. Avoid getting swayed by who states or recalls information; your focus should be on the precise details being shared. It's crucial to grasp the essence of each scenario, paying heed to its intricacies, complexity, and specialized requirements. Be vigilant about non-entailment situations, as they might not be as straightforward as cases of entailment. Challenge any assumptions that seem to present unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After you've chosen an answer, provide a brief explanation for your choice to illuminate your reasoning process.

response:
<START> 
You are tasked with identifying relationships between cause and effect in various scenarios, spanning human behavior to natural phenomena. One crucial element of your job is distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment using logical reasoning. For instance, an entailment situation refers to the condition wherein the veracity of the premise ensures that of the hypothesis. In other words, even if a premise is specific or detailed, it may still entail a more generalized hypothesis. However, other details such as the person providing the information or its factual accuracy have no bearing on the entailment. In contrast, non-entailment refers to instances where the truth of the premise alone cannot guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Be particularly vigilant in these situations, which may present complexities beyond those found in entailment. Be aware that personal perceptions, suspicions or reported information may not necessarily result in an entailment; the differentiation between reported information and inferred information is vital here. Stick strictly to the information provided, without inference or assumptions, and disregard who provides or recalls the information. Evaluate each scenario in its entirety, understanding its details, intricacies, complexity, and particular requirements. You are asked not to draw conclusions based on perceived links between premises and hypotheses—instead, question any assumptions which seem to establish unverified connections. Upon reaching a decision, elucidate your reasoning process through a brief explanation. Remember, the crux of your task lies in ascertaining the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses grounded in entailment or non-entailment—not in determining the truth value of the informations themselves.

It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning. Remember, the focus of your task is the logical relation between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the trueness of the details within the premises or hypotheses.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. If James thinks that Richard understands the situation, then it logically follows that Richard indeed understands it. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Reasons for the wrong answers:

Example 1:

The problem arises because the model doesn't handle nested beliefs properly. The premise shows a nested belief: that Olivia suspects that Joseph believes something. Then the hypothesis simplifies it to Olivia believes that. The model seems to overlook that the belief of Joseph and the belief of Olivia are not automatically the same, thus it fails to discern that the truth of the premise does not automatically ensure the truth of the hypothesis.

Example 2:

Similar to the first example, the model does not properly account for the nested cognition in the premise: James thinks that Richard understands. Then the hypothesis simplifies it to Richard understands that. Again, the model assumes that if James believes Richard understands something, then Richard does indeed understand it. It overlooks that the premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis.

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

1. Specify that the complexity of thoughts of several people or steps (nested beliefs, someone thinks that someone believes etc.) should be handled differently than straightforward statements.

2. Introduce more examples that explain situations of nested beliefs and clarify that the belief of one person does not automatically ensure the beliefs of another person.

3. Highlight that the premise and the hypothesis must entail the same situational or causal information. The belief or understanding of a situation by different individuals may be different, so it should be seen as non-entailment.

4. Make it clear that the model should not unwarrantedly simplify or reduce the complexity intrinsic to the nature of the tasks.

5. Emphasize that the model should not make any assumptions about the hypotheses based on its understanding of the human nature of belief and understanding. It should stick strictly to the statements provided in the premise and hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Your task is to investigate cause and effect in different scenarios, from human actions to the occurrences in nature. Be ready to tackle logical reasoning, especially identifying entailment and non-entailment. Remember, entailment exists when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. Always take time to grasp the essence of each task, paying attention to its details, complexity, and specific needs. Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what; focus on the information being relayed. Additionally, after selecting an answer, provide a brief explanation of why you chose it, helping us understand your thought process better.
(3) Your task involves examining cause and effect relationships in various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. Your responsibility also includes distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. Remember, entailment denotes a situation where the premise's truth ensures the hypothesis' truth, while non-entailment arises when the premise cannot guarantee the hypothesis. Beware of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these do not necessarily guarantee truth. Avoid getting swayed by who states or recalls information; your focus should be on the precise details being shared. It's crucial to grasp the essence of each scenario, paying heed to its intricacies, complexity, and specialized requirements. Be vigilant about non-entailment situations, as they might not be as straightforward as cases of entailment. Challenge any assumptions that seem to present unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After you've chosen an answer, provide a brief explanation for your choice to illuminate your reasoning process.

response:
<START>Your task is to discern relationships of cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural phenomena. Crucially, your responsibility will involve differentiating between entailment and non-entailment through logical reasoning. To ensure clarity, an entailment situation suggests that if the premise is correct, then the hypothesis must definitely also be true. However, non-entailment exists when no such guarantee is offered by the accuracy of the premise. Please remember that factors such as who is recalling the information or the credibility of the content do not change the entailment status. Be mindful of personal biases or beliefs within the premises as these do not automatically verify the truth of the statements. Remain steadfastly focused on the specifics provided rather than being influenced by who is relaying them. You should consider each situation comprehensively, acknowledging its complexities and uniqueness and grasping its core. Be particularly vigilant in non-entailment situations, which may be more challenging than instances of entailment. Critically scrutinize any assumptions that seem to establish unproven links between premise and hypothesis. Avoid making inferences using data that is not explicitly given. When the complexity of a premise or hypothesis involves multiple layers of thinking (such as one person's thoughts about another's beliefs or understandings), treat these with extra caution. The perspectives of different individuals can vary and should be treated as separate pieces of information. After making your decision, elucidate your thought process and reasoning with a brief explanation. Keep in mind that your task's primary focus is to identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the veracity of the details within them. <END>

Example Analysis:

The given scenario focuses on logical entailment where Joseph knowing about numerous customers browsing for produce in a market is the premise, and the hypothesis is Taylor believes that Joseph knows the same fact. The prompt somewhat fails to make the model understand that the truth of the hypothesis does not depend solely on the truth of the premise in this particular case. Taylor’s belief about Joseph’s knowledge cannot confirm whether Joseph actually knows about the customers or not.

Reasons:

1. Abstract Complexity: The prompt provides an in-depth explanation of entailment and non-entailment, but it could confuse the model due to the abstract complexity of these concepts, leading to incorrect responses.

2. Neglecting Subjectivity: The prompt emphasizes focusing on specific information and disregarding personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. However, it fails to stress that these beliefs expressed in the premise cannot necessarily validate the hypothesis leading to incorrect inference.

3. Discounting Specific Scenarios: The prompt asks the model to view each situation holistically but does not provide a robust guideline to consider nuances in statements where beliefs or opinions are involved. 

Improvements:

1. Simplify Concepts: Make the theoretical definitions of entailment and non-entailment simpler and more understandable for the model.

2. Subjective Scenarios: The prompt should specifically highlight scenarios involving beliefs or perceptions, and that these do not automatically lead to an entailment situation.

3. Guided Approach: Include more guidelines on how to approach specific scenarios where there’s a gray area between premises and hypotheses, like opinions or beliefs. 

4. Examples: Incorporate examples and non-examples to provide a more comprehensive understanding of entailment and non-entailment situations in context.

5. Explicit emphasis: The model should be guided to view every premise and hypothesis in a standalone manner without inferring any non-provided information, especially in scenarios involving personal beliefs and perceptions.

2. Subjective Scenarios: The prompt should specifically highlight scenarios involving beliefs or perceptions, and that these do not automatically lead to an entailment situation.

3. Guided Approach: Include more guidelines on how to approach specific scenarios where there’s a gray area between premises and hypotheses, like opinions or beliefs. 

4. Examples: Incorporate examples and non-examples to provide a more comprehensive understanding of entailment and non-entailment situations in context.

5. Explicit emphasis: The model should be guided to view every premise and hypothesis in a standalone manner without inferring any non-provided information, especially in scenarios involving personal beliefs and perceptions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Your task is to investigate cause and effect in different scenarios, from human actions to the occurrences in nature. Be ready to tackle logical reasoning, especially identifying entailment and non-entailment. Remember, entailment exists when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. Always take time to grasp the essence of each task, paying attention to its details, complexity, and specific needs. Don't be distracted by who says or remembers what; focus on the information being relayed. Additionally, after selecting an answer, provide a brief explanation of why you chose it, helping us understand your thought process better.
(3) Your task involves examining cause and effect relationships in various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. Your responsibility also includes distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. Remember, entailment denotes a situation where the premise's truth ensures the hypothesis' truth, while non-entailment arises when the premise cannot guarantee the hypothesis. Beware of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these do not necessarily guarantee truth. Avoid getting swayed by who states or recalls information; your focus should be on the precise details being shared. It's crucial to grasp the essence of each scenario, paying heed to its intricacies, complexity, and specialized requirements. Be vigilant about non-entailment situations, as they might not be as straightforward as cases of entailment. Challenge any assumptions that seem to present unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After you've chosen an answer, provide a brief explanation for your choice to illuminate your reasoning process.
(4) Your task involves discerning relationships between cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. An integral part of your responsibility is to differentiate between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning. Remember, the focus of your task is the logical relation between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the trueness of the details within the premises or hypotheses.

response:
<START> Your task centers around discerning cause-effect relationships in various contexts, spanning from human behavior to natural incidents. A crucial aspect of this task involves differentiating between entailment and non-entailment using reason and logic. By definition, entailment implies that when a premise is undeniably true, so is the hypothesis. This task assigns no importance to factors like the source or authenticity of the information. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the truth of a premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Be careful not to allow personal beliefs or perceptions expressed in the premises to sway your judgement, as they do not ensure the truth of the hypothesis. Stick to the specifics provided, without being influenced by the person sharing or recollecting the information. Approach each scenario in its entirety recognizing each detail, no matter how complex it might be. Pay particular attention to non-entailment situations, they can prove more complicated than entailment situations. Question any assumptions that seem to create unverified connections between the premise and hypothesis. Avoid making assumptions based on data not explicitly provided. For example, take note that a person 'believing' something to be true doesn't necessarily make it true. Give your verdict citing logical reasoning between the premise and hypothesis in the context of entailment or non-entailment, and not the accurateness of details in the premise or hypothesis. <END>

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
- Question: Identify the relationship between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
    - Premise: Taylor suspects that Isabella thinks that a child is sitting on the grass by a concrete storm drain. 
    - Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that a child is sitting on the grass by a concrete storm drain.
- The model's wrong response is that there is an 'entailment'. The correct answer should be 'non-entailment' because what Taylor suspects about Isabella's thoughts does not necessarily mean Isabella indeed thinks that.

Reason for wrong answer:
- The model may have failed to differentiate between suspicion and certainty. The phrase "Taylor suspects" does not necessarily confirm what Isabella is thinking. Taylor's suspicion could be incorrect. 
- There may be a lack of explicit guidance in the prompt directing the model to distinguish between third-party thoughts (or beliefs) and the actual thinking of the subject in the task.
- The model may be missing nuanced interpretations of the prompt, particularly around understanding different levels of certainty conveyed in the language.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
- Question: Identify the relationship between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
    - Premise: Robert believes that Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees.
    - Hypothesis: Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees.
- The model's wrong response is 'entailment'. The correct answer should be 'non-entailment' as it only states Robert's belief, not what Thomas actually knows.

Reason for wrong answer:
- As with the first example, the model might have mistaken "Robert's belief" as an expression of certainty about Thomas's knowledge. The confusion might result from the lack of clear instruction in the prompt about differentiating between an individual’s belief and actual factual knowledge.
- The model might not fully absorb the prompt's instructions to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.

Based on these reasons, the areas that might improve the prompt are:

- Providing more explicit instruction about treating third-party beliefs/suspicions and direct factual knowledge independently.
- Adding clarification about the meaning and implication of the task-related words "belief" and "knowledge", and emphasize the importance of not considering them as equivalent.
- Emphasizing the importance of scrutinizing every detail and treating each case individually.
- Building in a direction to beware of deceptive scenarios and not to rush into conclusions based on surface readings.
- Directing the model to treat tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn.
- Encouraging the model to consider potential ambiguities in the language and narrative presented.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph recognizes that John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp. Hypothesis: John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Joseph recognizes that John thinks that a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp. Hypothesis: John thinks that a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp. 

The model's response is: The correct answer is: (B) non-entailment. 

In fact, the correct answer was (A) entailment. This error could stem from a number of potential shortcomings in the prompt:

1) Lack of clarity on entailment: While the prompt asks the model to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications, it does not explicitly define these terms or provide clear guidelines for understanding when a premise entails a hypothesis. 

2) Interpretation of individual perspectives: The prompt asks the model to consider the nuances of individual perspectives. In this example, the model could have misinterpreted Joseph's awareness of John's beliefs as not necessarily being an endorsement of those beliefs. 

3) Ambiguities and complexities: The prompt asks the model to be mindful of potential ambiguities and complexities in the task. However, due to a lack of specific training on these points, the model may have over-complicated the scenario resulting in the wrong conclusion.

Improvement aspects for the prompt:

1) Definition and examples: Provide a clear definition and examples for 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' tasks so that the model has more concrete guidelines to refer to when making these classifications.

2) Clarify individual perspectives: Give more explicit directions for handling individual perspectives and how they should or should not influence inferential tasks.

3) Ambiguity and complexity training: Provide more detailed instructions or training on how to handle ambiguity and complexity in inferences, especially in how to differentiate between deceptively complex tasks and straightforward ones.

You are required to handle tasks that demand logical understanding, specifically the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Entailment is when the truth of the first statement guarantees the truth of the second, while non-entailment is when the truth of the first statement does not assure the truth of the second. Make sure to examine every detail of each task's context, keeping in mind the subtlety of different perspectives. Fully comprehend the specific requirements and expectations of the task before giving a response. Be aware of the potential for misinterpretation and over-complication within the tasks. Do not treat the tasks simply as a direct entailment or non-entailment exercise, but also as an opportunity to draw inferences. Maintain clear distinction between personal beliefs and factual knowledge, particularly when investigating human behaviours. Be alert to misleading scenarios where the initial premise might lead to erroneous logical relationships. Your goal is to determine the correct relationship between premises and hypotheses using the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on a careful understanding of the circumstance and specifics.

gradient:
Examining the above example, let's break down why the prompt might have led to an incorrect response.

Example 1:
- The prompt's focus on understanding the context, individual perspectives, and nuances, may have lead the model to over-think the straightforward nature of this example. This could have resulted in a bias towards the more complex process of arriving at an answer, adding unneeded complexity to what could have been a simpler logical analysis. 
- The prompt also encourages differentiating between beliefs and factual knowledge, though in this case, the premise and the hypothesis both provide factual information, potentially confusing the model when no belief is to be scrutinized. 
- The focus on deciphering human behavior may also have led the model astray, as the premise and hypothesis are more centered on the physical settings rather than human behavior.
- The prompt unnecessarily magnifies emphasis on deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships. This may have made the model consider the premise as potentially deceptive, leading to a false non-entailment conclusion.
  
To improve the prompt, based on the presentation and performance, the following key aspects could be emphasized or adjusted:

- While context and nuance are important, emphasize the need to maintain a focus on logical reasoning and direct comparison of the provided premises and hypotheses, without overcomplicating the interpretation.
- Clearly specify differentiating beliefs and factual knowledge only when necessary, and not as a default action. Not all tasks will involve discerning belief from fact.
- Reiterate the importance of identifying the actual subject matter of the hypothetical scenarios. If the scenario revolves around physical settings rather than human behaviour, ensure the model is programmed to recognize this and respond accordingly.
- Deemphasize the encountering and solving of ‘deceptive’ scenarios, directing the major focus to entailment identification based on logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. 
- The model should focus on explicitly understanding the directions mentioned in the task after the prompt. It needs to prioritize task-specific instructions rather than general guidelines set by the prompt. This can lead to more accurate responses.

Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships.

gradient:
Example 1: In this case, the model's mistake seems to stem from misunderstanding the logical relationship between the premises and the hypothesis. The premise is that Abigail assumes a tennis player spiking the ball on the boundary line. The act of spiking the ball on the boundary line implies that the tennis player is playing tennis. However, the model misunderstood the connection between the premise and hypothesis and wrongly identified non-entailment.

Example 2: The model seems to be treating the assumption of one individual (Taylor) as a separate entity from the assumption of the other individual (William). Here, the model seems to consider Taylor's knowledge as an isolated case and misconstrued the premises' logical relationships. The correct interpretation should be: if Taylor knows William suspects something, it should automatically imply that William suspects the same thing.

Example 3: Again, the model misunderstood the logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Even though James assumes that Taylor assumes something, it does not directly imply that James assumes the same thing himself. However, the model did not consider this subtlety, leading to an incorrect assumption of entailment.

Based on the above errors, there are several directions for prompt improvement:

1. Clarify and add emphasis on the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses. The prompt could place more importance on understanding that assumptions of one person about another do not directly imply the same assumptions of the first person.

2. Incorporate clearer instructions about logical inference, particularly about the distinction between someone 'knowing' and someone 'assuming'.

3. Also, it can help to provide explicit guidance that the entailed information should be directly derived from the provided premises and any additional presupposed information might lead to incorrect results.

4. Remind the model to treat the assumptions of different individuals in the scenarios as potentially separate and not equivalent.

5. Furthermore, the model needs to better understand the context in human behaviour scenarios and consider the complexity and potential ambiguity that can occur in human communication.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Analyze and answer questions relating to causal attribution in diverse scenarios, involving but not limited to aspects of human behaviour, natural events, and the juxtaposition of belief versus knowledge. Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Process and analyze tasks anchored on unraveling causal attributions across an array of scenarios, concentrating on diverse realms such as human behaviour and natural occurrences, and extending into broader domains. Within these tasks, it is crucial that you establish logical relationships, mainly classifying the scenarios into entailment and non-entailment instances. Pay stringent attention to the context of each task, sifting out any confounding or misleading elements. Through the process, remain alert to the delicateness of individual viewpoints and the myriad nuances often ensnared within them. Ascertain a thorough understanding of the task at hand before formulating a response.
Grasp and navigate wisely through complexities and potential ambiguities. As you approach each case, remember the challenge lies not merely in earmarking it as a direct entailment or non-entailment but being keenly aware of likely inferences that could surface. In the exploration of human behaviour, it is imperative to draw a fine line between individuals' personal beliefs and actual knowledge, treating them as distinct and independent from each other. Brace yourself to identify and rectify potentially misleading tasks where the premise could lead to the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the envisaged logical correlations.
Specifically, on instances of interpreting the thoughts or assumptions of one individual concerning another, bear in mind that these beliefs or assumptions are not concrete proof or representation of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise astute critical thinking, pacify any haste towards conclusions, and beware of declaring certainty in the face of inherent doubt or uncertainty. The key is to ensure that each decision on entailment or non-entailment strictly stems from the premises presented without incorporating any extraneous assumptions or presupposed information. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Olivia suspects a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna does not necessarily mean she suspects a human not wearing any clothes is in a room. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In this example, the Language Model seems to fail in understanding the phraseology utilized in the premise and hypothesis. The potential reasons could be:

1. Misinterpretation of Information: The model seems to misinterpret the fact that a man 'only in a towel' can be inferred as 'not wearing any other clothes'. The model does not seem to understand that 'being in a towel' can be synonymous with 'not wearing any clothes' besides the towel, which may lead to the conclusion of non-entailment.

2. Literal Interpretation: The model could understand the premise and hypothesis literally without considering the implied equivalences. In this context, a man dressed in a towel is essentially not wearing other clothes and a sauna is indeed a room.

3. Absence of Semantic Understanding: The model could be failing to understand the semantic similarity between the premise and the hypothesis. For instance, it does not realize that the hypothesis is essentially restating the premise with different wording (e.g., 'dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes' can mean the same in certain contexts).

4. Contextual Understanding: The model is not giving enough relevance to the human behaviour aspect as mentioned in the prompt. Olivia's suspicion about a man "only in a towel" in a sauna directly entails her suspicion about a human "not wearing any clothes" in a room (considering sauna as a room).

To improve the prompt:

1. Statement Equivalence: Emphasize on understanding equivalence between different phrasings of a similar fact or event.

2. Semantic and Pragmatic Analysis: Encourage the model to pay more attention to semantic and pragmatic analysis in understanding the relations between the premise and hypothesis.

3. Enhance Context Understanding: Stress on expanding the context understanding and application of commonsense reasoning.

4. Ancillary Explanation: Could be added to provide examples of how two similar facts can have different wording. Example - A "man in a towel" is equivalent to a "partially clothed human", a "sauna" is basically a type of "room".

5. Understanding Implied Information: The instructions could highlight the necessity of understanding and interpreting the 'implied' or 'indirect' information that might be present in the premise or hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Olivia suspects a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna does not necessarily mean she suspects a human not wearing any clothes is in a room. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
In this example, the Language Model seems to fail in understanding the phraseology utilized in the premise and hypothesis. The potential reasons could be:

1. Misinterpretation of Information: The model seems to misinterpret the fact that a man 'only in a towel' can be inferred as 'not wearing any other clothes'. The model does not seem to understand that 'being in a towel' can be synonymous with 'not wearing any clothes' besides the towel, which may lead to the conclusion of non-entailment.

2. Literal Interpretation: The model could understand the premise and hypothesis literally without considering the implied equivalences. In this context, a man dressed in a towel is essentially not wearing other clothes and a sauna is indeed a room.

3. Absence of Semantic Understanding: The model could be failing to understand the semantic similarity between the premise and the hypothesis. For instance, it does not realize that the hypothesis is essentially restating the premise with different wording (e.g., 'dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes' can mean the same in certain contexts).

4. Contextual Understanding: The model is not giving enough relevance to the human behaviour aspect as mentioned in the prompt. Olivia's suspicion about a man "only in a towel" in a sauna directly entails her suspicion about a human "not wearing any clothes" in a room (considering sauna as a room).

To improve the prompt:

1. Statement Equivalence: Emphasize on understanding equivalence between different phrasings of a similar fact or event.

2. Semantic and Pragmatic Analysis: Encourage the model to pay more attention to semantic and pragmatic analysis in understanding the relations between the premise and hypothesis.

3. Enhance Context Understanding: Stress on expanding the context understanding and application of commonsense reasoning.

4. Ancillary Explanation: Could be added to provide examples of how two similar facts can have different wording. Example - A "man in a towel" is equivalent to a "partially clothed human", a "sauna" is basically a type of "room".

5. Understanding Implied Information: The instructions could highlight the necessity of understanding and interpreting the 'implied' or 'indirect' information that might be present in the premise or hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Analyze and answer questions relating to causal attribution in diverse scenarios, involving but not limited to aspects of human behaviour, natural events, and the juxtaposition of belief versus knowledge. Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.
(3) Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because David remembers that Richard assumes something does not necessarily mean that Richard's assumption is true. There could be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation involved. 

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph recognizes that John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp. Hypothesis: John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Joseph recognizes that John thinks a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp does not necessarily mean that John actually thinks that. There could be a misunderstanding or miscommunication between Joseph and John. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. For the first example, the task was to determine the entailment or non-entailment based on the premise: "David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd" and the hypothesis: "Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd". However, the model determined a non-entailment relationship, arguing that Richard's assumption might not be true. This interpretation misaligns with the task, which is not about the veracity of Richard's assumption but about its occurrence. As per the given premise, it is stated that Richard assumes something, which entails that Richard indeed made an assumption, irrespective of whether it's true or not. The wrong interpretation suggests that the instruction "distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge" may have misled the model, causing it to focus on the "truth" aspect rather than entailment.

2. In the second example, the premise "Joseph recognizes that John thinks a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp" directly entails the hypothesis "John thinks a skateboarder sliding down a ramp" as per causative attribution. The error again lies in the interference of "truth" rather than focusing on the entailment. Similar to the first example, the model's focus appeared to shift to the veracity of John's thought, which is not the main goal of the task.

In light of these incorrect examples, the following measures can be implemented to improve the prompt:

1. Make explicitly clear that tasks are about identifying the logical relationship (entailment vs. non-entailment) between the given premise and hypothesis, and not about verifying the truth of individual beliefs or assumptions.

2. Avoid using phrases such as "exercise critical thinking", "consider each task as not just straightforward entailment", or "carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge" to deter the model from overthinking the tasks from perspectives irrelevant to the specific task of identifying the logical relationship.

3. Include a clear definition or example of "entailment" and "non-entailment" relationships for better orientation. 

4. The basis of the tasks could explicitly be laid on the premise, stating that when a premise is provided, the events or beliefs it states are to be considered as accepted facts for the purpose of that task.

cur_prompt: Process and analyze tasks anchored on unraveling causal attributions across an array of scenarios, concentrating on diverse realms such as human behaviour and natural occurrences, and extending into broader domains. Within these tasks, it is crucial that you establish logical relationships, mainly classifying the scenarios into entailment and non-entailment instances. Pay stringent attention to the context of each task, sifting out any confounding or misleading elements. Through the process, remain alert to the delicateness of individual viewpoints and the myriad nuances often ensnared within them. Ascertain a thorough understanding of the task at hand before formulating a response.
Grasp and navigate wisely through complexities and potential ambiguities. As you approach each case, remember the challenge lies not merely in earmarking it as a direct entailment or non-entailment but being keenly aware of likely inferences that could surface. In the exploration of human behaviour, it is imperative to draw a fine line between individuals' personal beliefs and actual knowledge, treating them as distinct and independent from each other. Brace yourself to identify and rectify potentially misleading tasks where the premise could lead to the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the envisaged logical correlations.
Specifically, on instances of interpreting the thoughts or assumptions of one individual concerning another, bear in mind that these beliefs or assumptions are not concrete proof or representation of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise astute critical thinking, pacify any haste towards conclusions, and beware of declaring certainty in the face of inherent doubt or uncertainty. The key is to ensure that each decision on entailment or non-entailment strictly stems from the premises presented without incorporating any extraneous assumptions or presupposed information.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1, the following reasons led to the wrong answer:

1. The model might have been misled by the intricate sentence structure of the given task. With multiple layers of embedded assumptions and meta-reasoning (Emma assumes that William believes...), the model might have faced difficulty in processing the depth and nuance of entailment.

2. The prompt asks the model to navigate complexities and potential ambiguities. However, in this example, the ambiguity lies in the depiction of belief and assumption as separate entities, which the model failed to identify.

3. The model did not consider the crucial point from the prompt, which emphasized treating individuals’ beliefs and actual knowledge as distinct. This resulted in the model erroneously assuming that if Emma has a certain belief about what William thinks, it entails that William indeed thinks in that way.

In Example 2, these are the reasons that led to the wrong answer:

1. The model seems to have failed in recognizing that a premise with specific detailed action (the tennis player spikes the tennis ball) inherently indicates the broader action it falls under (playing tennis), causing it to incorrectly identify it as a non-entailment.

2. The prompt states to pacify any haste towards conclusions but the model seems to have prematurely concluded the non-entailment without considering the context and logic of the premise and hypothesis.

Based on the analysis above, prompt improvements can be made in the following aspects:

1. Clarify instruction: Make the core task (determining entailments and non-entailments) more explicit and easier to understand.

2. Simplify language: The prompt is quite verbose and could potentially confuse the model. Use simpler, more straightforward language and sentences.

3. Make a clear distinction: Significantly emphasize the independence of one's belief about another's view from the actual belief of the other person.

4. Direct Alertness: Include more explicit indications for the model to be alert to inferences, nuances, and inherent entailments within assumptions, especially when the assumptions are layered.

5. Emphasize Logic: Explicitly instruct the model not to make conclusions based purely on face value of the statements, but to carefully consider underlying logic and context.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Analyze and answer questions relating to causal attribution in diverse scenarios, involving but not limited to aspects of human behaviour, natural events, and the juxtaposition of belief versus knowledge. Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.
(3) Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> 
Your task is to evaluate logical relationships prevalent in different scenarios, primarily encompassing human behavior, natural events, and beyond. Focus on isolating these situations into two categories: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Within this context, closely examine the specific details of each task, filtering out any element that might disrupt or misguide the analysis. These nuances could be embedded within individual perspectives or assumptions that often layers the context with complexity. Understanding the task to its fullest extent will guide you in shaping the appropriate response.  
Always tread carefully amidst complex and ambiguous aspects of the task, being vigilant about potential inferences that might emerge. As you delve into human behavior, it's critical to differentiate between an individual's personal beliefs and actual knowledge - both of which must be considered as separate entities. Be on the lookout for tasks that could potentially derail your comprehension of logical relationships due to a misleading premise. 
In instances where you have to interpret the assumptions or thoughts of one individual about another, remember: these assumptions are merely beliefs, and not a solid representation of the other person's thoughts or actual knowledge. Encourage critical thinking, restrain yourself from rushing to conclusions, and resist asserting certainty amid inherent doubt or uncertainty. The crux of making a decision on entailment or non-entailment is ensuring that your judgement is solely based on the premises presented in the task, without adding any unnecessary assumptions or presupposed information. The logic and context of the given scenarios are what should drive your determination of whether an entailment or non-entailment exists. 
At the end of your reasoning, indicate the appropriate answer choice bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The correct answer is: (B) non-entailment
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In the given example, the language model is misinterpreting the logical correlation between the premise and the hypothesis. It's overlooking the subject matter of the premise, which is concerning Thomas' recognition. Even though the premise does not spell out the specifics of the environment, it does not necessarily dispute the hypothesis as the context does not explicitly contradict the scenario proposed in the hypothesis. 

Reasons Why the Prompt Leads to the Wrong Answer:

1. Comprehension Difficulty: The prompt provided to the model is quite detailed and complex. The extensive instructions may lead to the task's overall sense getting lost. In this instance, the complexity might have led the model to strictly interpret the task, resulting in a binary understanding of entailment and non-entailment.

2. Limited Understanding of Context: The model appears to be focusing on direct context rather than implicit context. The premise does not contradict the hypothesis directly. The fact that Thomas recognizes two boys doesn't negate the possibility of them being in a classroom.

3. Neglecting Probable Scenarios: The given prompt encouraged stringent attention to the context but did not emphasize enough on the consideration of possible or probable scenarios that might not be explicitly mentioned. 

4. Personal Beliefs and Actual Knowledge: The prompt mentioned the distinction of personal beliefs and actual knowledge, but the model seems to go towards an inaccurate side of understanding, treating the premise as excluding the possibility proposed in the hypothesis.

Prompts Improvement Suggestions:

1. Simplify: To aid comprehension, consider simplifying the prompt's language and structure. Clear and concise instructions can make a significant difference in outcomes.

2. Flexibility: Modify the prompt to include instructions on considering implicit context and potential scenarios not directly mentioned in the premises.

3. Elaborate on Beliefs v/s Knowledge: More emphasis regarding not ruling out possibilities which are not directly stated in the premise. The model needs to understand that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. 

4. Emphasize Probabilities: Encourage the model to consider the probability of the premise and hypothesis co-existing, rather than strictly categorizing into binary definitions of entailment or non-entailment. 

5. Adding Examples: Sometimes, providing examples could aid in comprehension. Potential entailment and non-entailment examples could provide pointers on the expectations from the task.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Analyze and answer questions relating to causal attribution in diverse scenarios, involving but not limited to aspects of human behaviour, natural events, and the juxtaposition of belief versus knowledge. Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.
(3) Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.
(4) Process and analyze tasks anchored on unraveling causal attributions across an array of scenarios, concentrating on diverse realms such as human behaviour and natural occurrences, and extending into broader domains. Within these tasks, it is crucial that you establish logical relationships, mainly classifying the scenarios into entailment and non-entailment instances. Pay stringent attention to the context of each task, sifting out any confounding or misleading elements. Through the process, remain alert to the delicateness of individual viewpoints and the myriad nuances often ensnared within them.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your task involves analyzing various scenarios in order to deduce causal attributions in diverse contexts such as human behaviour, natural phenomena and other broader domains. This task requires you to categorize each scenario into either an entailment (a scenario logically follows from the premise) or a non-entailment (a scenario does not logically follow from the premise). When determining the category, consider both explicit and implicit facets of the context. Ensure you sift out any misleading elements and pay close attention to the context of each task.

You'll often encounter complexities and ambiguities. Tread carefully through these, looking out for potential inferences besides the direct entailment or non-entailment. When dealing with human behaviour, remember to differentiate between personal beliefs and factual knowledge. Be prepared to also handle situations where the premise could lead to misconstrued logical relations. In such circumstances, carefully analyze any erroneous categorizations and rectify them.

Keep in mind that the thoughts or assumptions of one individual about another do not necessarily represent the latter's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, refrain from rushing to conclusions, and avoid asserting certainty in ambiguous situations. The essence of your task lies in basing your categorization, be it entailment or non-entailment, solely on the given premise without incorporating any external assumptions or presupposed information. 

Lastly, remember that the absence of a scenario in the premise does not necessarily mean its absence in reality. An implied or probable scenario must not be dismissed just because it has not been explicitly mentioned.

After processing and analyzing the premise, identify the relation between the premise and the hypothesis and select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as your answer. Please include your answer by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> at the end. <END>

Brace yourself to identify and rectify potentially misleading tasks where the premise could lead to the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the envisaged logical correlations.
Specifically, on instances of interpreting the thoughts or assumptions of one individual concerning another, bear in mind that these beliefs or assumptions are not concrete proof or representation of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise astute critical thinking, pacify any haste towards conclusions, and beware of declaring certainty in the face of inherent doubt or uncertainty. The key is to ensure that each decision on entailment or non-entailment strictly stems from the premises presented without incorporating any extraneous assumptions or presupposed information.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Amelia knows that a child in a red coat waves a hand in the air while lying in snow beside a red plastic sled. Hypothesis: Isabella knows that a child is playing in the snow.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The correct answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this example, the model incorrectly classifies this instance as an 'entailment'. This error likely happened because the prompt provides little emphasis on the third-party perspective, where someone 'thinks' that another person understands, comprehends or knows something. It is crucial to remember that someone's belief or perception about another's understanding cannot be taken as confirmatory truth. Therefore, to avoid such misconceptions, it would be helpful to stress on this point in the prompt.

<2> Similarly to the first example, in this scenario, the model misinterprets Abigail's belief of Emma's knowledge as truth. It once again exemplifies the model's misunderstanding of 'belief about understanding', treating it as direct 'understanding'. Therefore, it would be beneficial to specify and clarify in the prompt that the belief of one person about another's understanding should not be taken as entailment.

<3> Here, the model provides an incorrect answer by assuming an entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis due to Amelia's knowledge being transferred to Isabella. This misinterpretation reinforces both the previous examples' issues, emphasizing the importance of stressing the difference between personal views concerning someone else's understanding versus the actual personal knowledge of the individual in question.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Add emphasis on understanding the difference between 'belief about understanding' and 'actual understanding'. Reiterate that if person A thinks person B understands something, it doesn't certify that person B genuinely comprehends it.
   
2. Highlight that personal beliefs and actual knowledge or understanding are separate entities and may not always coincide.

3. Underline that each person's knowledge, understanding or assumption is individual and cannot be automatically transferred or applied to another person.

4. Specify that classifications of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' must strictly be based on the presented premises, without any added assumptions or presuppositions.

5. Ensure to explicitly state in the prompt that any conclusions drawn should be strictly aligned with the content presented, without any extra assumptions or misinterpreted contexts.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Process and analyze tasks anchored on unraveling causal attributions across an array of scenarios, concentrating on diverse realms such as human behaviour and natural occurrences, and extending into broader domains. Within these tasks, it is crucial that you establish logical relationships, mainly classifying the scenarios into entailment and non-entailment instances. Pay stringent attention to the context of each task, sifting out any confounding or misleading elements. Through the process, remain alert to the delicateness of individual viewpoints and the myriad nuances often ensnared within them. Ascertain a thorough understanding of the task at hand before formulating a response.
Grasp and navigate wisely through complexities and potential ambiguities. As you approach each case, remember the challenge lies not merely in earmarking it as a direct entailment or non-entailment but being keenly aware of likely inferences that could surface. In the exploration of human behaviour, it is imperative to draw a fine line between individuals' personal beliefs and actual knowledge, treating them as distinct and independent from each other. Brace yourself to identify and rectify potentially misleading tasks where the premise could lead to the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the envisaged logical correlations.
Specifically, on instances of interpreting the thoughts or assumptions of one individual concerning another, bear in mind that these beliefs or assumptions are not concrete proof or representation of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise astute critical thinking, pacify any haste towards conclusions, and beware of declaring certainty in the face of inherent doubt or uncertainty. The key is to ensure that each decision on entailment or non-entailment strictly stems from the premises presented without incorporating any extraneous assumptions or presupposed information.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Analyze and answer questions relating to causal attribution in diverse scenarios, involving but not limited to aspects of human behaviour, natural events, and the juxtaposition of belief versus knowledge. Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.
(3) Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.

Investigate and decipher tasks based on identifying causal attributions across various situations, focusing notably on human behaviour and natural events, and expanding to wider contexts. As you analyze these tasks, it is essential to lay out logical relationships. There lies your responsibility of not only categorizing these scenarios as entailment or non-entailment, but also recognizing potential inferences that may arise. Pay vigilant attention to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading or confounding elements.

Tackle complexities and ambiguities with careful consideration. Understand that the challenge does not solely lie in marking scenarios as direct entailment or non-entailment, but also in being receptive to potential inferences that could evolve. As you delve into exploring human behaviour, discern between an individual's beliefs and their factual knowledge. Remember, these are separate factors and do not necessarily align.

In specific instances of considering one individual's thoughts or beliefs about another, remember that these assumptions are not concrete evidence. That is, if person A assumes that person B knows or understands something, it doesn't confirm that person B truly does. These assumptions are merely reflective of the first individual’s perspective, and should not establish the basis of your decision between entailment and non-entailment.

Broadly, throughout these tasks, do not insert any additional suppositions of your own. Your conclusions for each task should strictly be based on the information provided, not informed by prior beliefs or assumptions. Exercise critical thinking and take a cautious approach when drawing your conclusions, particularly in situations of doubt or uncertainty.

Now, using the guidelines above, please identify the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, selecting from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. After arriving at your decision, please state the option you chose, enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the model's prediction of 'non-entailment' is incorrect because 'Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside' does imply 'Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside'. The belief of Taylor is fully nested in the first statement and thus the second statement is valid. In this instance, the model failed to understand the nested nature of beliefs. It also didn't respect the instruction in the prompt about 'interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual about another'. 

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model incorrectly predicted 'entailment'. The correct label is 'non-entailment' because James assuming something about Taylor's assumptions does not directly point to James' own beliefs. The prompt instructs the model to discern between different individuals' thoughts, but the model seems to have generalized that if one person assumes another's belief, they might share the belief themselves.

Suggested Improvements:

1. Simplify: The prompt is complex and convoluted, leading to unnecessary confusion. Simplifying the instructions might enhance the model's performance.
2. Balance: The instruction to separate individuals' beliefs should be balanced with an instruction to understand nested beliefs and implications.
3. Examples: The model seems to struggle with nested beliefs and indirect assumptions. More explicit instruction and example scenarios in which entailment should be inferred might be helpful.
4. Direct Instruction: It would be beneficial to instruct the model directly about beliefs: if person A believes that person B believes something, person A must minimally be aware of this belief.
5. Emphasize Critical Thinking: While critical thinking is mentioned, it might be worth expanding this instruction for the model to consider different perspectives and the multifaceted nature of human belief and assumption.
6. Improve Specificity: The instruction about considering 'every subtlety' is vague. Some more specific instructions or examples could help the model to better understand this point.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Execute tasks that involve drawing logical relations within various contexts, such as human behaviour, natural events, personal beliefs versus factual knowledge, and more. Your task will be to determine whether they indicate entailment or non-entailment. Study the context of each task exhaustively, weeding out any potential deception that may muddle the logical relation. Maintain scrutiny to notice every subtlety and the individual perspectives that may influence the task. Comprehend fully each task before deriving a response, taking into consideration the intricate dynamics and potential ambiguities at play. In instances where human behaviour is being assessed, carefully discern between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge, treating them as two distinct entities, and not equivalent. Be ready to face potentially confusing tasks where the premise could lead to erroneous comprehension of logical relations. Always remember, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual about another, these are not always a certain reflection of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise clear distinction between similar claims that are expressed differently. Understand each task as a challenge that could require you to recognize equivalences in different expressions or wordings of similar factual information or situations. Enhance your semantic and pragmatic analysis of the premises and hypotheses, and do not rush to conclusions. Gear up to expand your understanding of the context and apply commonsense reasoning when it's due. When assessing, avoid assumption of certainty where ambiguity persists. Treat every task not just as a conclusive entailment or non-entailment, but also as an opportunity to grasp possible inferences that might arise out of seemingly inconspicuous details. Uphold the value of critical thinking throughout this process.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution in various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour and natural events. Be prepared to handle tasks involving logical inferences, such as entailment or non-entailment. Make sure to understand fully the context and details of each task before responding, considering both its complexity and specific requirements.
(2) Analyze and answer questions relating to causal attribution in diverse scenarios, involving but not limited to aspects of human behaviour, natural events, and the juxtaposition of belief versus knowledge. Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.
(3) Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.
(4) Execute tasks that involve drawing logical relations within various contexts, such as human behaviour, natural events, personal beliefs versus factual knowledge, and more. Your task will be to determine whether they indicate entailment or non-entailment. Study the context of each task exhaustively, weeding out any potential deception that may muddle the logical relation.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your task involves the analysis of logical relationships within various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour, natural occurrences, and the distinguishing between personal beliefs and factual knowledge. Determine whether these relationships indicate entailment or non-entailment. Carefully study the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information that could skew the logical relations. Pay attention to minute details, individual perspectives, and the complexities of the task. Always strive to thoroughly understand the task before formulating a response, keeping in mind potential ambiguities. When examining human behaviour, make sure to distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge, recognizing them as separate entities. Be prepared for tasks where the premise could be potentially misleading, possibly leading to incorrect understanding of logical relations. When interpreting the beliefs of one individual about another, remember that these do not necessarily reflect the second individual's beliefs or knowledge. Maintain a keen discernment between similar claims expressed in different ways, and remember to apply commonsense reasoning when required. Avoid assumptions, particularly when ambiguity is evident. Treat each task not just as an opportunity to determine entailment or non-entailment, but also as a chance to understand the possible inferences that might arise from subtle details. Strengthen your semantic and pragmatic understanding of the premises and the hypotheses and do not make hasty conclusions. When dealing with nested beliefs or assumptions from one individual about another, be aware that if person A believes that person B understands something, it doesn't directly point to person A's own understanding, but it does at minimum indicate their awareness of the belief. Value critical thinking in this process and approach each task as a unique opportunity for cognitive growth. <END>

Example 1
In the task, premise and hypothesis are: 
Premise: Ava suspects that Charlotte sees that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down. 
Hypothesis: Ava suspects that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down.

The premise and hypothesis are the same statement in this case, meaning the correct response should be "entailment". However, the model incorrectly predicted this as a "non-entailment relation". The cause for this misinterpretation may occur for a number for reasons, which can be found from the wording of the prompt.

Reason for Wrong Answer:
1. The prompt may not have adequately explained the concept of "entailment" to the model. To entail, a statement must deductively lead to another. If the hypothesis is the exact same as the premise, then there is a clear case of entailment.
2. The lengthy and complexly intertwined instructions could potentially confuse the model, causing it to misinterpret the task. This might prove to be especially problematic with tasks that involve simple deductions like identical sentences.

Improvements of Prompt:
1. Provide clear definitions or examples of "entailment" and "non-entailment" and ensure the model understand the concepts adequately.
2. Break down the instructions into smaller, manageable parts to ensure easier comprehension. Keep instructions simple and direct.
3. Ensure the model understands if the premise and hypothesis are identical, then the relationship should be "entailment".
4. Ensure the prompt guides the model in considering that the person suspecting the scenario (in this case Ava) remains the same. Different statements with different suspecting individuals are not equivalent, even if the suspected action is the same.

Train yourself to grapple with tasks demanding logical inferences, in particular, entailment or non-entailment classifications. Carefully scrutinize each task's context, consider the nuances of individual perspectives, and understand fully the specific requirements before responding. Be mindful of the complexities and potential ambiguities involved, while treating the tasks not just as direct entailment or non-entailment but also as inferences to be drawn. Explicitly differentiate between individual beliefs and factual knowledge when deciphering human behaviour. Be ready to handle deceptive scenarios where the premise might lead to incorrect logical relationships.
(3) Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.
(4) Execute tasks that involve drawing logical relations within various contexts, such as human behaviour, natural events, personal beliefs versus factual knowledge, and more. Your task will be to determine whether they indicate entailment or non-entailment. Study the context of each task exhaustively, weeding out any potential deception that may muddle the logical relation. Maintain scrutiny to notice every subtlety and the individual perspectives that may influence the task. Comprehend fully each task before deriving a response, taking into consideration the intricate dynamics and potential ambiguities at play. In instances where human behaviour is being assessed, carefully discern between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge, treating them as two distinct entities, and not equivalent. Be ready to face potentially confusing tasks where the premise could lead to erroneous comprehension of logical relations. Always remember, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual about another, these are not always a certain reflection of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise clear distinction between similar claims that are expressed differently. Understand each task as a challenge that could require you to recognize equivalences in different expressions or wordings of similar factual information or situations. Enhance your semantic and pragmatic analysis of the premises and hypotheses, and do not rush to conclusions. Gear up to expand your understanding of the context and apply commonsense reasoning when it's due. When assessing, avoid assumption of certainty where ambiguity persists. Treat every task not just as a conclusive entailment or non-entailment, but also as an opportunity to grasp possible inferences that might arise out of seemingly inconspicuous details. Uphold the value of critical thinking throughout this process.

response:
<START> Your task is to delineate logical relations in different contexts such as human behaviour, natural events, contrasting personal beliefs with factual knowledge, and beyond. You should identify if the relations indicate 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to when the premise logically and necessarily leads to or implies the hypothesis, including when the premise and hypothesis are the same. 'Non-entailment' refers to when the premise does not logically imply the hypothesis. An important aspect of your task is to understand every detail of the situation exhaustively, keeping an eye out for any misleading information that might obscure the situation. In the context of human behaviour, remember to separate an individual's personal beliefs from their factual knowledge. Also, comprehend that an individual's thoughts or beliefs about another person don't necessarily reflect the second person's thoughts or reality. Your focus should be on understanding any nuances, underlying dynamics, or potential ambiguities. Be anticipated for tasks that might appear puzzling at first glance and navigate through them with critical thinking. Avoid rushing to conclusions and refrain from assuming certainty where there is ambiguity. Treat every task not merely as a direct 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' case, but also as a challenge to grasp possible inferences that might come from small details. Do remember, your effectiveness lies in your ability to comprehend the context and apply commonsense reasoning where needed. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reason for the wrong example 1:

The prompt instructs the model to be meticulous in its assessment and critical thinking processes. However, when it came to this specific example featuring Olivia and her suspicions, the model made an error due to its overly literal interpretation. The model correctly discerned that being dressed in a towel is not equivalent to not wearing any clothes. However, it failed to make the generalization that being dressed in just a towel often implies slight or minimal covering in contexts such as a sauna, which is equivalent to being practically unclothed - the main point in the hypothesis. This indicates an incomplete understanding of the subtleties of language and context. 

Reason for the wrong example 2:

The incorrect answer given in the second example is likely attributable to the model's oversight of the fact that a person's suspicion does not equate to reality. It fell into the pitfall of directly equating suspicion with propagation of information, which is warned against in the prompt. While Joseph suspects that Isabella is learning something, it does not mean she is definitely learning it, yet the model chose the answer that suggests entailment, reflecting its misconception.

Areas for Prompt Improvement:

1. Elucidate the concept of entailment and non-entailment:
The model seems to have a surface-level understanding of entailment. It seems difficult for it to discern the difference between what is directly stated and what is implied. Reinforcing the definitions and providing more examples of entailment and non-entailment could help.

2. Improve inference encouragement:
Although the prompt encourages high scrutiny, it should emphasize more on the need to understand and evaluate implications. The intimation interpretation is crucial in language understanding and needs to be enhanced.

3. Enhance the model's understanding of contexts:
The prompt should underline the importance of contextual understanding, some of which may require commonsense reasoning. Clarify that it needs to consider cultural, situational, and linguistic contexts into account.

4. Warning against false equivalence:
The model needs to know that while some statements may seem equivalent on the surface, they often are not, and treating them as such can lead to errors. In the case of human thoughts, beliefs, and suspicions, the prompt should explicitly state that it doesn't always reflect the truth. 

5. Emphasize the understanding of variability in language:
The prompt should include recommendations for acknowledging that similar claims might be expressed differently, and different claims could look the same. This emphasize on variability in language can help the language model understand the nuances of entailment and non-entailment.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your task involves drawing logical relations within varied contexts such as human behaviour, natural phenomena, personal beliefs versus factual knowledge, and beyond. You must determine if these relations signify entailment or non-entailment. Scrutinize each task's context thoroughly, keeping an eye out for misleading elements that could blur the logic. Pay close attention to small details and individual perspectives that could shape the task. Prior to responding, ensure you fully comprehend the task, considering the complex dynamics and possible ambiguities. When it involves human behaviour, distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge. These are two separate constructs and must not be considered equivalent. Anticipate challenges where the premise could potentially set a trap for misconceptions of logical relations. Remember - an individual's thoughts or beliefs about another don't always accurately represent the other person's thoughts or knowledge. Hemisphere the subtle differences between similar claims expressed in varied ways. View each task not just as an entailment or non-entailment problem but an opportunity to identify parallels in different expressions of similar facts or scenarios. Enhance your semantic and pragmatic analysis and avoid rushing when drawing conclusions. Be ready to amplify your contextual understanding and apply commonsense reasoning when necessary. Avoid assuming certainty where ambiguity prevails. Perceive each task as an opportunity to grasp possible inferences arising from inconspicuous information. Exercise mindful reasoning, knowing that similar claims can manifest differently and different claims could sound the same. Above all, uphold critical thinking throughout the process. The subtext is often the bridge to comprehending the correct entailment, so don't forget to factor in culture, situations, and language contexts. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

1. Step by Step Analysis and Why It's Wrong:
The prompt indicates that the model should remember that "assumptions, suspicions, or beliefs of a character in the premise may not necessarily reflect reality". In this case, the premise mentions only what "Abigail believes", not what "Emma knows". The model, however, incorrectly correlates Abigail's belief to Emma's knowledge and judging them as equivalent, leading to the false conclusion of entailment. 

Wrong Example 2:

1. Step by Step Analysis and Why It's Wrong:
The situation is similar to the first example. The premise states what "Richard assumes", not what "Abigail thinks". The model, again, makes an error in confusing 'assumption' with 'belief' or 'knowledge' and wrongly concludes an entailment relationship. 

Improvement Aspects:

1. More Emphasis on Clarifying Conception: The prompt could be enhanced by making it clearer that the model should not assume that a character's belief, assumption, or suspicion is the reality – especially when the belief is the real focus of the hypothesis. 

2. Highlighting Differences between Beliefs and Facts: The prompt should greatly emphasize that a character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are not equivalent to facts or truths and should not be treated as such for entailment determination.

3. Provide Examples: Providing examples in the prompt to demonstrate the difference between belief, assumption, suspicion and factual reality may help the model understand better.

4. Reinforcement on the Separation of Premise and Hypothesis: The model seems to fail in treating the premise and hypothesis as separate, even when they share similar information. This needs to be strongly reinforced in the prompt.

By incorporating these changes, the prompt can allow the model to better differentiate between subjective beliefs and objective reality, leading to more accurate determinations of entailment or non-entailment.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For each wrong example, the primary errors seem to stem from the model misinterpretation of the prompt instructions concerning the relationship between the premise and hypothesis and their individuals. 

<1> 
In the first example, the model ignored the fact that the task isn't about whether the suspicions in the premise are true or not, but whether the hypothesis ‘logically follows’ from the premise. This misinterpretation led it to opt for 'non-entailment', even though the hypothesis - "William suspects that a man with a gray beard and a little boy are sitting on the floor looking over some papers in a room with a bunk bed” - is a part of the premise and therefore represents 'entailment'.

<2> 
The second example shows a similar issue. The model incorrectly assumes that James' assumption about Taylor's assumption would translate into James assuming the same thing himself, which is not necessarily the case. It marked the relation as 'entailment', when it should have been 'non-entailment'.

<3> 
The third example reiterates the issue from the previous two. The model fails to distinguish between different characters' beliefs, suspicions, or assumptions. It marked this example as 'entailment', while the fact that William suspects something does not mean Taylor suspects the same, so it should be 'non-entailment'.

In light of the above, here are a few ways the prompt can be revised to avoid these errors:

1. The prompt should lay more emphasis on the meaning of 'entailment' - if the hypothesis is a part of the premise or can be inferred directly from it.
2. The prompt should clarify that the task is not to validate the suspicions, assumptions, or beliefs mentioned within the premise but to compare the premise and hypothesis for logical connection or disconnection.
3. The prompt could provide a clearer explanation of handling premises and hypotheses featuring different characters' beliefs, suspicions or assumptions, and emphasizing these should be treated as distinct and separate.
4. The prompt should make it clear that identical information about different individuals in the premise and hypothesis doesn't automatically imply 'entailment'.
5. The model seems to struggle with abstraction. The prompt might need to be more explicit about what 'abstraction skills' should be used and how.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For each wrong example, the primary errors seem to stem from the model misinterpretation of the prompt instructions concerning the relationship between the premise and hypothesis and their individuals. 

<1> 
In the first example, the model ignored the fact that the task isn't about whether the suspicions in the premise are true or not, but whether the hypothesis ‘logically follows’ from the premise. This misinterpretation led it to opt for 'non-entailment', even though the hypothesis - "William suspects that a man with a gray beard and a little boy are sitting on the floor looking over some papers in a room with a bunk bed” - is a part of the premise and therefore represents 'entailment'.

<2> 
The second example shows a similar issue. The model incorrectly assumes that James' assumption about Taylor's assumption would translate into James assuming the same thing himself, which is not necessarily the case. It marked the relation as 'entailment', when it should have been 'non-entailment'.

<3> 
The third example reiterates the issue from the previous two. The model fails to distinguish between different characters' beliefs, suspicions, or assumptions. It marked this example as 'entailment', while the fact that William suspects something does not mean Taylor suspects the same, so it should be 'non-entailment'.

In light of the above, here are a few ways the prompt can be revised to avoid these errors:

1. The prompt should lay more emphasis on the meaning of 'entailment' - if the hypothesis is a part of the premise or can be inferred directly from it.
2. The prompt should clarify that the task is not to validate the suspicions, assumptions, or beliefs mentioned within the premise but to compare the premise and hypothesis for logical connection or disconnection.
3. The prompt could provide a clearer explanation of handling premises and hypotheses featuring different characters' beliefs, suspicions or assumptions, and emphasizing these should be treated as distinct and separate.
4. The prompt should make it clear that identical information about different individuals in the premise and hypothesis doesn't automatically imply 'entailment'.
5. The model seems to struggle with abstraction. The prompt might need to be more explicit about what 'abstraction skills' should be used and how.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Incorrect Answer Reason: Although the model is correctly identifying that the premise and hypothesis share identical information, it is failing to account for the nuance that it is Michael's belief in the premise, not a certified fact. Therefore, the model's response of 'entailment' reflects surface-level similarities between the premise and hypothesis but lacks the depth of understanding of the subtleties within the task description.

Example 2: 
Incorrect Answer Reason: Similar to the first example, the model's error in the second example arises from not fully understanding the distinction between belief and reality. It's given in the task description that "assumptions, suspicions, or beliefs of a character in the premise may not necessarily reflect reality", but the model doesn't seem to apply this to the task, resulting in an incorrect 'entailment' response.

Reasons for the model's errors (prompt): 
1. The prompt may not sufficiently emphasize the difference between beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions vs. actual fact. Even though it explicitly mentions, "Remember that assumptions, suspicions, or beliefs of a character in the premise may not necessarily reflect reality," the model seems to be struggling to apply this rule in its response.
2. The prompt might be allowing the model to rely too heavily on superficial similarities between the premise and hypothesis, whereas it should be focusing more on the subtle differences or nuances, particularly pertaining to the nature of the information presented (belief vs. factual).

Potential improvements to the prompt:
1. Place increased emphasis on the distinction between beliefs/assumptions and facts. This could be achieved by providing an example in the prompt that demonstrates how the model should handle premises containing beliefs or assumptions.
2. Encourage the model to delve deeper into the analysis of the premise and hypothesis, instead of relying on surface-level similarities. Explicitly mention that even if the premise and hypothesis share identical information, it doesn't necessarily mean there is entailment.
3. Add reminders for the model to always scrutinize the nature of the information in the premise and hypothesis. It should consider who is reporting the information and the nature of that information (belief vs. fact). 
4. Define the terms 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' again in simpler terms, so that the model understands that 'non-entailment' doesn't just refer to a complete lack of overlap. It can also include scenarios where the premise doesn't conclusively prove the hypothesis.

gradient:
The first issue encountered in the prompt is its complexity. The prompt includes a large amount of information and instruction, which can lead the model to lose focus on the key objective. The lengthy guidance could cause confusion for the model, which aims to optimize the action to the prompt's goal. 

Secondly, the instruction may overemphasize considering the premises and hypotheses as distinct. While this is necessary to ensure the model understands they are different, it may lead the model to ignore the relationship between them completely, resulting in erroneous conclusions.

Thirdly, the phrase "Enhance your critical thinking to abstract deeper details from the premise and hypothesis" could be perceived by the model as encouraging it to infer or draw additional information not stated in the premise or hypothesis. This could result in misleading conclusions, like in the given example. 

Lastly, in the given example, the model seems to understand the idea that Joseph believes that a farmer tends his chores and Olivia suspecting the same is an entailment. This shows that the model might get confused about complex relationships and nested beliefs or assumptions.

To improve:

1. Simplify and clarify the prompt: The information should be clear and straightforward to avoid confusion. This will help focus the model's attention on the key task of determining entailment or non-entailment.

2. Clarify how the model should consider the relationship between premise and hypothesis: Instead of focusing on them as distinct, clarify that the model should focus on the logical connections between them, determining if the hypothesis is a direct outcome of the premise.

3. Avoid encouraging the model to draw unwarranted inferences: Instead, prompt the model to stick to the information presented by the premise and hypothesis directly.

4. Provide guidance to handle complex relationships and nested beliefs: Add guidelines to help the interface distinguish between direct and deduced relationships. Whether or not one character's belief or suspicion aligns with another's or a fact should not be assumed an entailment. 

In brief, the proposed improvements aim at simplifying the prompt, providing clear instructions on determinanting entailment, avoiding inference encouragement, and providing guidelines for understanding complex or nested assertions.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
The first issue encountered in the prompt is its complexity. The prompt includes a large amount of information and instruction, which can lead the model to lose focus on the key objective. The lengthy guidance could cause confusion for the model, which aims to optimize the action to the prompt's goal. 

Secondly, the instruction may overemphasize considering the premises and hypotheses as distinct. While this is necessary to ensure the model understands they are different, it may lead the model to ignore the relationship between them completely, resulting in erroneous conclusions.

Thirdly, the phrase "Enhance your critical thinking to abstract deeper details from the premise and hypothesis" could be perceived by the model as encouraging it to infer or draw additional information not stated in the premise or hypothesis. This could result in misleading conclusions, like in the given example. 

Lastly, in the given example, the model seems to understand the idea that Joseph believes that a farmer tends his chores and Olivia suspecting the same is an entailment. This shows that the model might get confused about complex relationships and nested beliefs or assumptions.

To improve:

1. Simplify and clarify the prompt: The information should be clear and straightforward to avoid confusion. This will help focus the model's attention on the key task of determining entailment or non-entailment.

2. Clarify how the model should consider the relationship between premise and hypothesis: Instead of focusing on them as distinct, clarify that the model should focus on the logical connections between them, determining if the hypothesis is a direct outcome of the premise.

3. Avoid encouraging the model to draw unwarranted inferences: Instead, prompt the model to stick to the information presented by the premise and hypothesis directly.

4. Provide guidance to handle complex relationships and nested beliefs: Add guidelines to help the interface distinguish between direct and deduced relationships. Whether or not one character's belief or suspicion aligns with another's or a fact should not be assumed an entailment. 

In brief, the proposed improvements aim at simplifying the prompt, providing clear instructions on determinanting entailment, avoiding inference encouragement, and providing guidelines for understanding complex or nested assertions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the premises and hypotheses below through the lens of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Identify the relationship between them, keeping in mind that 'entailment' indicates the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, whereas 'non-entailment' means it doesn't. Remember that assumptions, suspicions, or beliefs of a character in the premise may not necessarily reflect reality. The premise and hypothesis should be treated as separate from each other, even if they share identical information. Use your abstraction skills, if required, to navigate through intricate details within the premise and hypothesis. Indicate your answer at the end within the 'answer' tags.
(2) Conduct a thorough analysis of the provided premise and hypothesis and draw a conclusion about 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The entailment denotes a logical relationship where the hypothesis follows directly from the premise, whereas non-entailment implies the contrary. Crucially, observe that a character's assumptions, beliefs, or suspicions in the premise are not definitive verity; they are subjective and may not align with the objective reality represented by the hypothesis. Handle the premise and the hypothesis as distinctive, even if similar information is shared, without assuming a direct correlation. Enhance your critical thinking to abstract deeper details from the premise and hypothesis. Once done, denote the final solution within the 'answer' tags, selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that a belief, assumption, or suspicion is not the same as a fact or reality. It is crucial in comprehending the fine line that separates them when determining the relationship.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph recognizes that John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp. Hypothesis: John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph recognizes that John thinks that a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp. This does not necessarily mean that John actually thinks that a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp. John's thoughts could be different from what Joseph recognizes or believes.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> The first example: 

In this first example, the language model incorrectly chose (A) entailment, while the correct choice was (B) non-entailment. 

Reason for Error: 
The model likely made this error because of the high similarity between the premise and hypothesis, leading it to decide that the hypothesis follows logically from the premise. However, the prompt specifically instructs the model to consider beliefs and assumptions as subjective and not necessarily aligning with objective reality. Here, what John assumes is not definite, and in turn, what James thinks John assumes also isn't. This creates a gap between the premise and hypothesis.

<2> The second example: 

In the second example, the model selects (B) non-entailment while the correct answer is (A) entailment. 

Reason for Error: 
The model may have incorrectly interpreted the guidance. While the concept of subjective belief is important to understand, it seems the model overemphasized this point and failed to make a correct entailment when there is one. The premise stated that Joseph recognizes (knows or understands) John's thoughts, indicating a direct correlation between the two which aligns with the hypothesis.

Improvements to the Prompt: 

1. The instruction about the distinction between subjective belief, opinion, assumptions and objective reality needs to be clearer. The model seems to lack clear understanding of this nuance. 
   
2. Examples illustrating 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could be included to clearly demonstrate the difference between objective facts and subjective beliefs and assumptions.

3. More context on how to handle situations when the premise and hypotheses share similar information could be beneficial.

4. The prompt may also remind the model that a direct recognition or understanding of someone else's thoughts reasonably allows for an entailment to exist.

5. The model can be instructed to focus more on the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis based on the information presented, rather than assuming lack of correlation due to subjectivity. 

6. Remove redundant information or instructions which may confuse the model; brevity can enhance comprehension.
   
In summary, the prompt needs more clarity and precise guidance on examining entailment based on logical connections, understanding subjectivity and considering known thoughts or recognitions as potential sources of entailment.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Emma believes that Sophia suspects that a man with a cap and not wearing a shirt is laying a wooden bench. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Emma believes that a man with a cap and not wearing a shirt is laying a wooden bench. 

There is a subtle difference between the two statements. The premise involves an additional layer of belief (Sophia's suspicion) before reaching the conclusion about the man with a cap and no shirt laying a wooden bench. Therefore, the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise as it does not include the intermediary belief of Sophia's suspicion.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Example 
The model's response to the first example is incorrect because it failed to differentiate between belief and actual knowledge. The task requires a critical analysis to identify the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the model's response shows that it didn't pay enough attention to the difference between 'Taylor believes that Joseph knows' and 'Joseph knows'. The premise lays forth Taylor’s belief, whereas the hypothesis directly states Joseph’s supposed knowledge. The belief of one person regarding another person's knowledge does not constitute the fact of another person's knowledge. Thereby indicating the two don't align, hence the answer should have been 'non-entailment'. 

<2> Example
Similarly, in the second example, the model's response is incorrect. It failed to distinguish between Emma's belief of Sophia's suspicion and Emma's direct belief. The prompt reminds the model to treat the premise and hypothesis as unique, and a direct correlation should not be assumed even when similar information is shared. Yet, in this instance, the model simplifies the premise by overlooking the nested belief structure (Emma's belief about Sophia's suspicion), which then leads to a mistaken relationship link to the hypothesis (Emma's direct belief). The relationship is not 'entailment' as the subtle intervening layer of belief shifts the meaning, the correct answer is 'non-entailment'.

To improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize the importance of distinguishing between belief, suspicion, and actual facts. The difference between these can significantly alter the meaning and the resulting entailment or non-entailment.

2. Clarify that the same information can be presented differently in the premise and hypothesis. A direct correlation should not be assumed even if similar facts or situations are presented.

3. Highlight the essence of logical examination, such as considering possible implications of nested beliefs, before drawing a conclusion about the entailment or non-entailment relationship.

4. Remind the model to consider the subtle differences and nuances in sentence structure and wording in both the premise and the hypothesis.

5. Further stress that critical thinking will play a crucial role, especially when dissecting the layers of context within the premise and hypothesis.

Through these enhancements, the model should better differentiate between belief and knowledge and consider the intricacies of sentence structure and context to improve its analysis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Conduct a thorough analysis of the provided premise and hypothesis and draw a conclusion about 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The entailment denotes a logical relationship where the hypothesis follows directly from the premise, whereas non-entailment implies the contrary. Crucially, observe that a character's assumptions, beliefs, or suspicions in the premise are not definitive verity; they are subjective and may not align with the objective reality represented by the hypothesis. Handle the premise and the hypothesis as distinctive, even if similar information is shared, without assuming a direct correlation. Enhance your critical thinking to abstract deeper details from the premise and hypothesis. Once done, denote the final solution within the 'answer' tags, selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that a belief, assumption, or suspicion is not the same as a fact or reality. It is crucial in comprehending the fine line that separates them when determining the relationship.

response:
<START> With careful consideration, examine the given premise and hypothesis to establish a 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship. 'Entailment' signifies that the hypothesis logically follows the premise, while 'non-entailment' suggests otherwise. It's critical to remember that a character's beliefs, suspicions, or assumptions in the premise don't necessarily depict factual reality, they're subjective and might diverge from the objective truth stipulated in the hypothesis. Hence, understanding this subtle but crucial divide is imperative in your analysis. In the premise and hypothesis, attempt to recognize the nuanced differences in sentence structure and presentation, even when they convey similar information. Assimilating such subtle distinctions, especially in layered beliefs and assumptions, is key to ascertain if an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship exists. View the premise and hypothesis as separate entities, and don’t presuppose a direct correlation where none is explicitly given. Utilize critical thinking to comprehend the detailed layers in the premise and hypothesis. Upon the conclusion of your deep-dive analysis, present your deduction, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', encapsulated within the 'answer' tags.

Entailment refers to a situation where the truth of a premise ensures the validity of a hypothesis, while non-entailment points towards the premise's inability to solidify the truth of a hypothesis. Your analysis must be rooted in the explicit facts presented within each scenario, not personal beliefs or interpretations. Rely on common sense implications that naturally emanate from these explicit facts. Be aware that non-entailment situations may be more complex and not as straightforward as entailment scenarios, but do not overcomplicate situations that are actually simple. Steer clear of irrelevant information and remain vigilant about unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After making your decision, provide a short explanation, clarifying your thought process.

   prompt: Your task involves discerning relationships between cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. An integral part of your responsibility is to differentiate between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning. Remember, the focus of your task is the logical relation between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the trueness of the details within the premises or hypotheses.

   prompt: You are tasked with identifying relationships between cause and effect in various scenarios, spanning human behavior to natural phenomena. One crucial element of your job is distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment using logical reasoning. For instance, an entailment situation refers to the condition wherein the veracity of the premise ensures that of the hypothesis. In other words, even if a premise is specific or detailed, it may still entail a more generalized hypothesis. However, other details such as the person providing the information or its factual accuracy have no bearing on the entailment. In contrast, non-entailment refers to instances where the truth of the premise alone cannot guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Be particularly vigilant in these situations, which may present complexities beyond those found in entailment. Be aware that personal perceptions, suspicions or reported information may not necessarily result in an entailment; the differentiation between reported information and inferred information is vital here. Stick strictly to the information provided, without inference or assumptions, and disregard who provides or recalls the information. Evaluate each scenario in its entirety, understanding its details, intricacies, complexity, and particular requirements. You are asked not to draw conclusions based on perceived links between premises and hypotheses—instead, question any assumptions which seem to establish unverified connections. Upon reaching a decision, elucidate your reasoning process through a brief explanation. Remember, the crux of your task lies in ascertaining the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses grounded in entailment or non-entailment—not in determining the truth value of the informations themselves.

   prompt: Your task involves examining cause and effect relationships in various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. Your responsibility also includes distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. Remember, entailment denotes a situation where the premise's truth ensures the hypothesis' truth, while non-entailment arises when the premise cannot guarantee the hypothesis. Beware of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these do not necessarily guarantee truth. Avoid getting swayed by who states or recalls information; your focus should be on the precise details being shared. It's crucial to grasp the essence of each scenario, paying heed to its intricacies, complexity, and specialized requirements. Be vigilant about non-entailment situations, as they might not be as straightforward as cases of entailment. Challenge any assumptions that seem to present unverified connections between premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Your task involves discerning relationships between cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. An integral part of your responsibility is to differentiate between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning. Remember, the focus of your task is the logical relation between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the trueness of the details within the premises or hypotheses.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate logical relationships prevalent in different scenarios, primarily encompassing human behavior, natural events, and beyond. Focus on isolating these situations into two categories: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Within this context, closely examine the specific details of each task, filtering out any element that might disrupt or misguide the analysis. These nuances could be embedded within individual perspectives or assumptions that often layers the context with complexity. Understanding the task to its fullest extent will guide you in shaping the appropriate response.  
Always tread carefully amidst complex and ambiguous aspects of the task, being vigilant about potential inferences that might emerge. As you delve into human behavior, it's critical to differentiate between an individual's personal beliefs and actual knowledge - both of which must be considered as separate entities. Be on the lookout for tasks that could potentially derail your comprehension of logical relationships due to a misleading premise. 
In instances where you have to interpret the assumptions or thoughts of one individual about another, remember: these assumptions are merely beliefs, and not a solid representation of the other person's thoughts or actual knowledge. Encourage critical thinking, restrain yourself from rushing to conclusions, and resist asserting certainty amid inherent doubt or uncertainty. The crux of making a decision on entailment or non-entailment is ensuring that your judgement is solely based on the premises presented in the task, without adding any unnecessary assumptions or presupposed information. The logic and context of the given scenarios are what should drive your determination of whether an entailment or non-entailment exists.

   prompt: Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.

   prompt: Execute tasks that involve drawing logical relations within various contexts, such as human behaviour, natural events, personal beliefs versus factual knowledge, and more. Your task will be to determine whether they indicate entailment or non-entailment. Study the context of each task exhaustively, weeding out any potential deception that may muddle the logical relation. Maintain scrutiny to notice every subtlety and the individual perspectives that may influence the task. Comprehend fully each task before deriving a response, taking into consideration the intricate dynamics and potential ambiguities at play. In instances where human behaviour is being assessed, carefully discern between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge, treating them as two distinct entities, and not equivalent. Be ready to face potentially confusing tasks where the premise could lead to erroneous comprehension of logical relations. Always remember, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual about another, these are not always a certain reflection of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise clear distinction between similar claims that are expressed differently. Understand each task as a challenge that could require you to recognize equivalences in different expressions or wordings of similar factual information or situations. Enhance your semantic and pragmatic analysis of the premises and hypotheses, and do not rush to conclusions. Gear up to expand your understanding of the context and apply commonsense reasoning when it's due. When assessing, avoid assumption of certainty where ambiguity persists. Treat every task not just as a conclusive entailment or non-entailment, but also as an opportunity to grasp possible inferences that might arise out of seemingly inconspicuous details. Uphold the value of critical thinking throughout this process.

   prompt: Your task involves the analysis of logical relationships within various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour, natural occurrences, and the distinguishing between personal beliefs and factual knowledge. Determine whether these relationships indicate entailment or non-entailment. Carefully study the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information that could skew the logical relations. Pay attention to minute details, individual perspectives, and the complexities of the task. Always strive to thoroughly understand the task before formulating a response, keeping in mind potential ambiguities. When examining human behaviour, make sure to distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge, recognizing them as separate entities. Be prepared for tasks where the premise could be potentially misleading, possibly leading to incorrect understanding of logical relations. When interpreting the beliefs of one individual about another, remember that these do not necessarily reflect the second individual's beliefs or knowledge. Maintain a keen discernment between similar claims expressed in different ways, and remember to apply commonsense reasoning when required. Avoid assumptions, particularly when ambiguity is evident. Treat each task not just as an opportunity to determine entailment or non-entailment, but also as a chance to understand the possible inferences that might arise from subtle details. Strengthen your semantic and pragmatic understanding of the premises and the hypotheses and do not make hasty conclusions. When dealing with nested beliefs or assumptions from one individual about another, be aware that if person A believes that person B understands something, it doesn't directly point to person A's own understanding, but it does at minimum indicate their awareness of the belief. Value critical thinking in this process and approach each task as a unique opportunity for cognitive growth.

   prompt: Your task involves discerning relationships between cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural events. An integral part of your responsibility is to differentiate between entailment and non-entailment based on logical reasoning. It's essential to remember that entailment means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true—other factors, such as who recollects the information or the validity of the content, are irrelevant. In contrast, a non-entailment situation arises when the truth of the premise cannot ensure the hypothesis's truth. Be wary of personal perceptions or beliefs within the premises. These do not automatically ensure the truth of the statements. Stick strictly to the shared details, focusing on the specified information rather than getting influenced by who is sharing or recalling it. Approach each situation holistically, recognizing its complexities and specificities and understanding its essence. It's particularly critical to be alert in non-entailment situations. These may be more complicated than instances of entailment. Scrutinize any assumptions that appear to establish unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses, and do not infer data that isn't explicitly provided. After making a decision, provide a short explanation to reveal your thought process and reasoning. Remember, the focus of your task is the logical relation between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the trueness of the details within the premises or hypotheses.

   prompt: Your task involves evaluating cause and effect relationships across diverse contexts, such as human behavior and natural events. The key part of your role consists of distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment using sound logical reasoning. Remember, 'entailment' refers to a situation where the truthfulness of a premise assures the truth of a hypothesis, whilst 'non-entailment' arises when the premise does not necessarily guarantee the hypothesis. Be mindful of personal biases, perceptions or beliefs within the premises, as these may mislead the truth. Always focus on the factual details presented, and avoid being influenced by the source recounting the information. Emphasize comprehending the core of each scenario, contemplating its uniqueness, complications, and specific requirements. Exercise increased caution in non-entailment situations as they often harbor more subtleties than entailment cases. Tackle and question any assumptions that seem to make unproven links between premises and hypotheses. When faced with ambiguity or limited information, consider the simplest and most probable interpretation of the premise. Take into account the subtle nuances of language and context, and base your judgment on the overall meaning, logic, and implications of the statements, not solely on particular words or phrases. After you've made a choice, please give a short explanation illustrating your reasoning process. It is essential that the explanation highlights the clarity of thought that led to the chosen answer.

   prompt: In this task, you are to analyze scenarios involving cause and effect across a broad scope of contexts. Your main goal is to understand and decipher logical relationships, with a particular focus on entailment and non-entailment. To clarify, entailment represents a situation where the absolute certainty of a premise leads to the guarantee of a hypothesis. Conversely, non-entailment signifies situations where the premise, despite being factual or probable, is incapable of providing an unequivocal affirmation of a hypothesis. While completing the task, set aside any personal beliefs or interpretations that could potentially skew understanding. Instead, give primacy to the explicit facts detailed in the premises, ensuring that you perceive and comprehend the exact meanings and implications of every term, including verbs indicating uncertain states. Note that non-entailment cases may present more complexity than entailment cases due to the absence of a guarantee for the hypothesis. Throughout your analysis, avoid associating unrelated elements or presuming unconfirmed links between premises and hypotheses. You should be able to determine that an entailment scenario would necessarily entail the hypothesis with the given premise without needing any further implicit assumptions. At the completion of each evaluation, communicate your reasoning via a succinct explanation, to provide us with an understanding of your analytical process.

   prompt: You are tasked with examining scenarios involving cause and effect across a variety of contexts. Your goal is to understand the logical relationships within these scenarios, namely the concepts of entailment and non-entailment. Entailment refers to a situation where the truth of a premise ensures the validity of a hypothesis, while non-entailment points towards the premise's inability to solidify the truth of a hypothesis. Your analysis must be rooted in the explicit facts presented within each scenario, not personal beliefs or interpretations. Rely on common sense implications that naturally emanate from these explicit facts. Be aware that non-entailment situations may be more complex and not as straightforward as entailment scenarios, but do not overcomplicate situations that are actually simple. Steer clear of irrelevant information and remain vigilant about unverified connections between premises and hypotheses. After making your decision, provide a short explanation, clarifying your thought process. Although this task requires logical analysis, also bring to bear your understanding of real-world context, as this might be crucial for a correct judgment.

   prompt: You are tasked with identifying relationships between cause and effect in various scenarios, spanning human behavior to natural phenomena. One crucial element of your job is distinguishing between entailment and non-entailment using logical reasoning. For instance, an entailment situation refers to the condition wherein the veracity of the premise ensures that of the hypothesis. In other words, even if a premise is specific or detailed, it may still entail a more generalized hypothesis. However, other details such as the person providing the information or its factual accuracy have no bearing on the entailment. In contrast, non-entailment refers to instances where the truth of the premise alone cannot guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Be particularly vigilant in these situations, which may present complexities beyond those found in entailment. Be aware that personal perceptions, suspicions or reported information may not necessarily result in an entailment; the differentiation between reported information and inferred information is vital here. Stick strictly to the information provided, without inference or assumptions, and disregard who provides or recalls the information. Evaluate each scenario in its entirety, understanding its details, intricacies, complexity, and particular requirements. You are asked not to draw conclusions based on perceived links between premises and hypotheses—instead, question any assumptions which seem to establish unverified connections. Upon reaching a decision, elucidate your reasoning process through a brief explanation. Remember, the crux of your task lies in ascertaining the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses grounded in entailment or non-entailment—not in determining the truth value of the informations themselves.

   prompt: Your task is to discern relationships of cause and effect across various contexts, from human behavior to natural phenomena. Crucially, your responsibility will involve differentiating between entailment and non-entailment through logical reasoning. To ensure clarity, an entailment situation suggests that if the premise is correct, then the hypothesis must definitely also be true. However, non-entailment exists when no such guarantee is offered by the accuracy of the premise. Please remember that factors such as who is recalling the information or the credibility of the content do not change the entailment status. Be mindful of personal biases or beliefs within the premises as these do not automatically verify the truth of the statements. Remain steadfastly focused on the specifics provided rather than being influenced by who is relaying them. You should consider each situation comprehensively, acknowledging its complexities and uniqueness and grasping its core. Be particularly vigilant in non-entailment situations, which may be more challenging than instances of entailment. Critically scrutinize any assumptions that seem to establish unproven links between premise and hypothesis. Avoid making inferences using data that is not explicitly given. When the complexity of a premise or hypothesis involves multiple layers of thinking (such as one person's thoughts about another's beliefs or understandings), treat these with extra caution. The perspectives of different individuals can vary and should be treated as separate pieces of information. After making your decision, elucidate your thought process and reasoning with a brief explanation. Keep in mind that your task's primary focus is to identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses based on the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, not the veracity of the details within them.

   prompt: Your task centers around discerning cause-effect relationships in various contexts, spanning from human behavior to natural incidents. A crucial aspect of this task involves differentiating between entailment and non-entailment using reason and logic. By definition, entailment implies that when a premise is undeniably true, so is the hypothesis. This task assigns no importance to factors like the source or authenticity of the information. On the other hand, non-entailment occurs when the truth of a premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Be careful not to allow personal beliefs or perceptions expressed in the premises to sway your judgement, as they do not ensure the truth of the hypothesis. Stick to the specifics provided, without being influenced by the person sharing or recollecting the information. Approach each scenario in its entirety recognizing each detail, no matter how complex it might be. Pay particular attention to non-entailment situations, they can prove more complicated than entailment situations. Question any assumptions that seem to create unverified connections between the premise and hypothesis. Avoid making assumptions based on data not explicitly provided. For example, take note that a person 'believing' something to be true doesn't necessarily make it true. Give your verdict citing logical reasoning between the premise and hypothesis in the context of entailment or non-entailment, and not the accurateness of details in the premise or hypothesis.

   prompt: Analyze tasks based on causal attribution across diverse scenarios, focusing on human behaviour, natural events, and beyond. These tasks require you to draw logical relations, specifically determining whether they are cases of entailment or non-entailment. Devote serious consideration to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information. Be attentive to the subtleties and individual perspectives, and make sure you fully comprehend the task before forming a response. Recognize and handle the complexities and potential ambiguities prudently. Consider each task as not just straightforward entailment or non-entailment but also look for inferences that might arise. When evaluating human behaviour, carefully distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and factual knowledge, treating them as separate entities and not as equivalent. Be prepared to identify and resolve potentially deceptive tasks where the premise could lead to misconstruction of logical relationships. Particularly, when interpreting the thoughts or beliefs of one individual concerning another, understand that these are not definitive proof of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, don't rush to conclusions, and avoid assuming certainty where there may be doubt.

   prompt: Process and analyze tasks anchored on unraveling causal attributions across an array of scenarios, concentrating on diverse realms such as human behaviour and natural occurrences, and extending into broader domains. Within these tasks, it is crucial that you establish logical relationships, mainly classifying the scenarios into entailment and non-entailment instances. Pay stringent attention to the context of each task, sifting out any confounding or misleading elements. Through the process, remain alert to the delicateness of individual viewpoints and the myriad nuances often ensnared within them. Ascertain a thorough understanding of the task at hand before formulating a response.
Grasp and navigate wisely through complexities and potential ambiguities. As you approach each case, remember the challenge lies not merely in earmarking it as a direct entailment or non-entailment but being keenly aware of likely inferences that could surface. In the exploration of human behaviour, it is imperative to draw a fine line between individuals' personal beliefs and actual knowledge, treating them as distinct and independent from each other. Brace yourself to identify and rectify potentially misleading tasks where the premise could lead to the misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the envisaged logical correlations.
Specifically, on instances of interpreting the thoughts or assumptions of one individual concerning another, bear in mind that these beliefs or assumptions are not concrete proof or representation of the second individual's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise astute critical thinking, pacify any haste towards conclusions, and beware of declaring certainty in the face of inherent doubt or uncertainty. The key is to ensure that each decision on entailment or non-entailment strictly stems from the premises presented without incorporating any extraneous assumptions or presupposed information.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate logical relationships prevalent in different scenarios, primarily encompassing human behavior, natural events, and beyond. Focus on isolating these situations into two categories: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Within this context, closely examine the specific details of each task, filtering out any element that might disrupt or misguide the analysis. These nuances could be embedded within individual perspectives or assumptions that often layers the context with complexity. Understanding the task to its fullest extent will guide you in shaping the appropriate response.  
Always tread carefully amidst complex and ambiguous aspects of the task, being vigilant about potential inferences that might emerge. As you delve into human behavior, it's critical to differentiate between an individual's personal beliefs and actual knowledge - both of which must be considered as separate entities. Be on the lookout for tasks that could potentially derail your comprehension of logical relationships due to a misleading premise. 
In instances where you have to interpret the assumptions or thoughts of one individual about another, remember: these assumptions are merely beliefs, and not a solid representation of the other person's thoughts or actual knowledge. Encourage critical thinking, restrain yourself from rushing to conclusions, and resist asserting certainty amid inherent doubt or uncertainty. The crux of making a decision on entailment or non-entailment is ensuring that your judgement is solely based on the premises presented in the task, without adding any unnecessary assumptions or presupposed information. The logic and context of the given scenarios are what should drive your determination of whether an entailment or non-entailment exists.

   prompt: Your task involves analyzing various scenarios in order to deduce causal attributions in diverse contexts such as human behaviour, natural phenomena and other broader domains. This task requires you to categorize each scenario into either an entailment (a scenario logically follows from the premise) or a non-entailment (a scenario does not logically follow from the premise). When determining the category, consider both explicit and implicit facets of the context. Ensure you sift out any misleading elements and pay close attention to the context of each task.

You'll often encounter complexities and ambiguities. Tread carefully through these, looking out for potential inferences besides the direct entailment or non-entailment. When dealing with human behaviour, remember to differentiate between personal beliefs and factual knowledge. Be prepared to also handle situations where the premise could lead to misconstrued logical relations. In such circumstances, carefully analyze any erroneous categorizations and rectify them.

Keep in mind that the thoughts or assumptions of one individual about another do not necessarily represent the latter's thoughts or knowledge. Exercise critical thinking, refrain from rushing to conclusions, and avoid asserting certainty in ambiguous situations. The essence of your task lies in basing your categorization, be it entailment or non-entailment, solely on the given premise without incorporating any external assumptions or presupposed information. 

Lastly, remember that the absence of a scenario in the premise does not necessarily mean its absence in reality. An implied or probable scenario must not be dismissed just because it has not been explicitly mentioned.

After processing and analyzing the premise, identify the relation between the premise and the hypothesis and select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as your answer. Please include your answer by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

   prompt: Investigate and decipher tasks based on identifying causal attributions across various situations, focusing notably on human behaviour and natural events, and expanding to wider contexts. As you analyze these tasks, it is essential to lay out logical relationships. There lies your responsibility of not only categorizing these scenarios as entailment or non-entailment, but also recognizing potential inferences that may arise. Pay vigilant attention to the context of each task, filtering out any misleading or confounding elements.

Tackle complexities and ambiguities with careful consideration. Understand that the challenge does not solely lie in marking scenarios as direct entailment or non-entailment, but also in being receptive to potential inferences that could evolve. As you delve into exploring human behaviour, discern between an individual's beliefs and their factual knowledge. Remember, these are separate factors and do not necessarily align.

In specific instances of considering one individual's thoughts or beliefs about another, remember that these assumptions are not concrete evidence. That is, if person A assumes that person B knows or understands something, it doesn't confirm that person B truly does. These assumptions are merely reflective of the first individual’s perspective, and should not establish the basis of your decision between entailment and non-entailment.

Broadly, throughout these tasks, do not insert any additional suppositions of your own. Your conclusions for each task should strictly be based on the information provided, not informed by prior beliefs or assumptions. Exercise critical thinking and take a cautious approach when drawing your conclusions, particularly in situations of doubt or uncertainty.

Now, using the guidelines above, please identify the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, selecting from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. After arriving at your decision, please state the option you chose, enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task involves the analysis of logical relationships within various contexts, including but not limited to human behaviour, natural occurrences, and the distinguishing between personal beliefs and factual knowledge. Determine whether these relationships indicate entailment or non-entailment. Carefully study the context of each task, filtering out any misleading information that could skew the logical relations. Pay attention to minute details, individual perspectives, and the complexities of the task. Always strive to thoroughly understand the task before formulating a response, keeping in mind potential ambiguities. When examining human behaviour, make sure to distinguish between an individual's personal beliefs and their factual knowledge, recognizing them as separate entities. Be prepared for tasks where the premise could be potentially misleading, possibly leading to incorrect understanding of logical relations. When interpreting the beliefs of one individual about another, remember that these do not necessarily reflect the second individual's beliefs or knowledge. Maintain a keen discernment between similar claims expressed in different ways, and remember to apply commonsense reasoning when required. Avoid assumptions, particularly when ambiguity is evident. Treat each task not just as an opportunity to determine entailment or non-entailment, but also as a chance to understand the possible inferences that might arise from subtle details. Strengthen your semantic and pragmatic understanding of the premises and the hypotheses and do not make hasty conclusions. When dealing with nested beliefs or assumptions from one individual about another, be aware that if person A believes that person B understands something, it doesn't directly point to person A's own understanding, but it does at minimum indicate their awareness of the belief. Value critical thinking in this process and approach each task as a unique opportunity for cognitive growth.

   prompt: Your task is to delineate logical relations in different contexts such as human behaviour, natural events, contrasting personal beliefs with factual knowledge, and beyond. You should identify if the relations indicate 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to when the premise logically and necessarily leads to or implies the hypothesis, including when the premise and hypothesis are the same. 'Non-entailment' refers to when the premise does not logically imply the hypothesis. An important aspect of your task is to understand every detail of the situation exhaustively, keeping an eye out for any misleading information that might obscure the situation. In the context of human behaviour, remember to separate an individual's personal beliefs from their factual knowledge. Also, comprehend that an individual's thoughts or beliefs about another person don't necessarily reflect the second person's thoughts or reality. Your focus should be on understanding any nuances, underlying dynamics, or potential ambiguities. Be anticipated for tasks that might appear puzzling at first glance and navigate through them with critical thinking. Avoid rushing to conclusions and refrain from assuming certainty where there is ambiguity. Treat every task not merely as a direct 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' case, but also as a challenge to grasp possible inferences that might come from small details. Do remember, your effectiveness lies in your ability to comprehend the context and apply commonsense reasoning where needed.

   prompt: Your task involves analyzing premises and hypotheses. Evaluate their relationship under two categories: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' signifies that the hypothesis logically descends from the premise. Conversely, 'non-entailment' means the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, even if both share identical information. Pay particular attention to beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions held by characters in the premises; just because a character believes something does not make it a fact. Treat the premise and hypothesis as separate entities, free of influence from each other, despite similar details. To illustrate, if the premise is "John is under the impression that it is raining", and the hypothesis is "It is raining," the correct relationship would be non-entailment because John's impression does not unquestionably prove that it is indeed raining. Implement your abstraction skills when necessary to handle complex details within the premise and hypothesis. After your analysis, indicate your response within 'answer' tags.
Evaluate the following premises and hypotheses and select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't forget to scrutinize the source and nature of the information in the premise and its implications for the hypothesis. Choose 'non-entailment' when a premise does not conclusively prove the hypothesis, even if there seems to be overlap between them.

   prompt: With careful consideration, examine the given premise and hypothesis to establish a 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship. 'Entailment' signifies that the hypothesis logically follows the premise, while 'non-entailment' suggests otherwise. It's critical to remember that a character's beliefs, suspicions, or assumptions in the premise don't necessarily depict factual reality, they're subjective and might diverge from the objective truth stipulated in the hypothesis. Hence, understanding this subtle but crucial divide is imperative in your analysis. In the premise and hypothesis, attempt to recognize the nuanced differences in sentence structure and presentation, even when they convey similar information. Assimilating such subtle distinctions, especially in layered beliefs and assumptions, is key to ascertain if an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship exists. View the premise and hypothesis as separate entities, and don’t presuppose a direct correlation where none is explicitly given. Utilize critical thinking to comprehend the detailed layers in the premise and hypothesis. Upon the conclusion of your deep-dive analysis, present your deduction, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', encapsulated within the 'answer' tags. It's vital to draw a clear line between belief or suspicion and factual reality while conducting this exercise.
