                "prompt": "Determine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, bearing in mind the concept of 'entailment'. Entailment refers to cases where the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the truth of the premise. Now, pay attention particularly when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions of a character in the narrative are involved. Note that the character's belief, assumption, or suspicion does not directly prove or contribute evidence to the reality of another character in the hypothesis. However, when these notions concern a situation or event, and the same is reflected in the hypothesis, it could imply 'entailment'. Therefore, decide whether the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or doesn't necessarily do so (non-entailment) on a case-by-case basis. When providing your response, choose 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and make sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Chris believes the game is understandable', the correct answer would be 'entailment', as Chris' belief about Jack's understanding implies that Chris also perceives the game as understandable. On the contrary, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Jack understands the game', the correct answer is 'non-entailment', as Chris' belief cannot confirm Jack's understanding.",

It's important not to overlook the structure and order of the sentences, as these can highly influence the logical relationship between the premises and hypotheses. Pay careful attention to the subtle differences in wording or context that may alter the overall meaning. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, ask yourself: \"Is it impossible for the premise to be true if the hypothesis is false?\" and \"Is it impossible for the hypothesis to be true if the premise is false?\" A simple truth consistency between the premise and hypothesis does not constitute entailment. Discern very carefully between what is assumed and what has been confirmed within these statements. Also, it's crucial not to generalize information from the premise to apply it to the hypothesis. After thorough examination, decide if the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Your options are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't forget to consider the broader context in your decision process. Conclude your analysis by providing your chosen answer, enclosing it in <answer> and </answer> tags.",

You need to consider causality, but also keep in mind that any direct or indirect assumptions might present. Exercise careful judgment in identifying if the main assertion arises from first-hand information or is derived from someone else's perspective or supposition. Just because the premise and hypothesis share some content does not immediately point to entailment. Equal importance should be given to the initial source of the information and how it was established. Be aware that entailment not only depends on conspicuous similarities in the description of people or objects. It's also significantly reliant on the coherence of the viewpoint in the narrative, and on whether the removal of certain layers of information still maintains the core content that aligns the premise and the hypothesis. Remember that just because a person believes something, it doesn't mean this belief translates automatically into verifiable knowledge for another individual. The shift from belief to knowledge should maintain consistency with the same viewpoint.

Amid your evaluation, take into consideration that the premise should completely support all elements of the hypothesis for the case to be 'entailment'. Contemplate on subtle facets such as direct and indirect kinships between the entities mentioned, their sources of insight, the degree of certainty, and potential linguistic ambiguities. Analyze whether 'X believes Y understands' and 'Y understands' are essentially the same. If you spot any phrases causing ambiguity, handle with discretion. Make sure to choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', incorporating your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>.",

Presume that 'X believes Y understands', is equivalent to 'Y understands', unless contradicted by additional context inside the premise. Similarly, when the premise and hypothesis denote the same entity, it is to be treated synonymously, such as 'man' and 'human'. Adjust your comprehension to match contextually similar scenarios in a premise and a hypothesis, like 'dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes' at a sauna. Grasp the subtle layers, including direct and indirect relations between the entities, their sources of knowledge, the certainty level, and possible linguistic confusions. Remember, for the case to be 'entailment', the premise must wholly affirm every key element of the hypothesis. If it contradicts or excludes any key hypothesis component, the case is 'non-entailment'.
