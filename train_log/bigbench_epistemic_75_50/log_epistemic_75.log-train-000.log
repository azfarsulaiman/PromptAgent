My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert believes that Sophia recognizes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches. Hypothesis: Robert believes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches.

Premise: Robert believes that Sophia recognizes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches. Hypothesis: Robert believes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches.

The model wrongly identified the input as a non-entailment. The error arises possibly because the model wasn't able to accurately discern the nested causality and believe perspective in the input.

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas assumes that Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium. Hypothesis: Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium.

The model's incorrect prediction could stem from it incorrectly interpreting Thomas's assumption about Robert as a concrete assertion, whereas it may not necessarily hold truth.

<3>
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.

The model failed to recognize that Joseph's suspicion is merely a suspicion and does not necessitate that Isabella indeed learns the woman is standing at the podium, leading to an incorrect entailment prediction.

Improvements for prompt:

1. Clarify that in cases of beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, the premise doesn't always entail the hypothesis.
2. Emphasise the need to interpret 'who’ is making the statement as it may influence the truth of the premise and the hypothesis, and thus the relation between them.
3. Modify the task prompt to include the instruction to consider the nature and certainty of the sentence being analyzed. In particular, concepts like suspicions or beliefs should not necessarily be seen as truth-entailing.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first wrong example:

The question asks for an analysis of the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and whether there is an 'entailment' between them. Here, the model seems to misinterpret the complexity of epistemic modality (the expression of knowledge, belief, uncertainty, doubt etc. e.g., "thinks," "assumes") presented in these statements. Instead, it seems to consider the similarity of the description of an object or person (in this case, "an engineer with a blue jacket and cap wears purple gloves while looking up") to be the deciding factor, regardless of the person who is assuming or acknowledging this information.

For the second wrong example:

This error is similar to the first one in that the model does not fully understand the implications of the premise's epistemic modality. It doesn't recognize that what "James assumes that Taylor assumes" could be entirely different from what "James assumes" directly. It seems to overlook the fact that entailment depends quite heavily on the source and path of information, not just the information itself.

In both cases, the model misses the crucial understanding that entailment is not only about the core content, while the influence of the observer/thinker plays a significant role too because it shapes the information.

Moving Forward:
The prompt could be improved in the following ways:

1. Include an explicit request for the model to consider the modality of the statements: the model should consider whether any kind of indirect assumption, thinking from someone else's perspective, or any similar elements are involved in the premise and hypothesis.
   
2. Define 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' clearly: It would be useful to prompt the model to recall or consider the definitions of entailment and non-entailment, as in this context they require understanding of narrative viewpoint and epistemic modality.

3. Specific Examples: To enhance its understanding, the model can be shown examples of similar tasks focusing on the comprehension of epistemic modalities, their effect on the narrative, and how to determine entailment accordingly.

4. Make it clear that A does not always entail B just because they share similar descriptive content. Rather, the source and path of that information might be crucial in determining the entailment.

gradient:
<1> 
The question stems from a perspective of logic and semantics rather than causal attribution. It's about whether a given position logically implies the hypothesis (entailment) or not (non-entailment). 

The model incorrectly predicted non-entailment because the prompt focused on causal attribution, which tends to simplify complex situations and can overlook intricate logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. The model might have been confused by the additional details in the premise (e.g., description of shirts and toys), not realizing these details don't change the core recognition of two boys indicated in the hypotheses.

<2> 
The model seems to be confused by the difference between 'William assuming' that Emma sees something and 'Emma actually seeing' something. In a task concerning causal attribution, the model might focus on the expressed action (seeing a dog), but overlook the implied uncertainty (that it's an assumption, and not a confirmed observation). Thus, it incorrectly predicts that the premise entails the hypothesis.

<3>
The roles are confused in this example. In a task concerning causal attribution, the model can be led to believe that the premise has to cause the hypothesis. However, the premise and hypothesis here are describing the same ongoing action. The model was swayed by the level of detail in the premise, treating it as additional information rather than an embellished description of the same event. Consequently, it incorrectly judged it as non-entailment.

Based on these, the following improvements can be made in the prompt:
1. Clarify the language model's task to focus on logical connections instead of causal attributions. 
2. The model should be instructed to pay attention to subtle differences, such as assumption versus confirmation.
3. The instruction should emphasize the essence of entailment and non-entailment, asking the model to focus on the core concept/event without being swayed by additional details or descriptions. Information in the premise doesn't necessarily override the entailment/non-entailment relationship with the hypothesis.
4. The model should be guided to appreciate that the same event can be represented at different levels of detail in the premise and hypothesis, without affecting the entailment relationship.

gradient:
Reasons for Wrong Answers:

1. Complexity in understanding beliefs, suspicions, and assumptions: The model seems to struggle with understanding nuances in statements relating to beliefs, suspicions, or assumptions. In the given example, Ava's belief in Emma's suspicion does not necessarily entail that Emma does suspect. There might be a chance that Ava is wrong about her belief.

2. Missing distinction between direct and indirect assertions: The model possibly cannot differentiate between direct and indirect assertions about a person's mental state. Here, the premise is an indirect assertion about Emma's suspicions (since it's Ava's belief, not a proven fact) while the hypothesis is direct.

3. The prompt's ambiguity: The prompt vaguely mentions that the nature of the statement like beliefs or suspicions may not necessarily imply entailment. Instead of effectively guiding the language model, it might be causing confusion.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clear statement about the importance of Direct Assertions: Clarify that when interpreting the entailment of suspicion or belief statements, a direct statement is required for entailment.

2. More precise conditions for Entailment: Define entailment clearly. Provide a more explicit guide explaining that the premise should unequivocally support the hypothesis.

3. Unpack indirect assertions: Include guidance for the model to treat the premise about someone's belief or suspicion as a separate assertion that doesn't necessarily confirm the hypothesis.

4. Simplified Instructions: Make instructions more simple and straight-forward. Avoid the use of overly complex sentences to give instructions, as these can muddy the model's understanding of the task.

The revised version of the prompt might look like this:

Analyze the given premises and hypotheses. Carefully evaluate whether the premise directly supports or confirms the hypothesis. When dealing with statements about beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, remember that a direct assertion is needed for entailment. Indicate the answer as simply 'entailment' if the premise directly confirms the hypothesis and 'non-entailment' if it does not, placing your answer in between <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this example, the model incorrectly identified the relationship between the premise and hypothesis as non-entailment. The premise and hypothesis both indicate that Charles understands there are people - three young girls and a baby - outdoors. Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis. One of the reasons the model might have given the incorrect answer is ambiguity in the prompt about how to consider beliefs or suspicions. It's important for the language model to understand that understanding and being certain equate to belief in this context. The language model did not interpret 'understanding' as a form of belief, hence, it couldn't correlate the premise and the hypothesis.

Example 2:
In this case, despite Robert's belief, it is not necessarily true that Thomas knows about a specific circumstance. A person's belief about what someone else knows is a suspicion or assumption and doesn't confirm the second person's knowledge. However, the language model incorrectly treated the belief as a fact, hence it thought the premise entailed the hypothesis. 

The prompt's ambiguity regarding the role of beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions may have led the model astray.

In conclusion, the prompt could be improved by:

1. Clearly specifying how to approach the notion of 'understanding' in the premise text, to help the model clearly discern that 'understanding' in the context entails belief.
2. Providing clearer guidelines on distinguishing between a person's belief as a fact and considering belief as suspicion or assumption. The current prompt treats beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions as all potentially different, which could create confusion for the model.
3. Clarifying how the model should evaluate the relationship between the premises and hypotheses when the information is transmitted between multiple individuals.
4. Offering more explicit instructions for deducing relationships based on indirect information and through levels of communication.
5. Offering clarifications on what implies an entailment and what does not, especially in complex interaction or communication structures.

For each wrong example:

<1> 
In this example, the prompt's directives may be confusing the model. The statement provided: 'Michael believes that James recognizes...' involves beliefs, which the prompt specifies may not necessarily entail that the premise confirms the hypothesis. However, the model erroneously treats 'Michael's belief' as valid evidence of 'James' recognition'. This reveals a misunderstanding of the logical interaction between premise and hypothesis. An attribution of belief from one character doesn't necessarily reflect the actual knowledge of the second character.

<2> 
Here again, the model misinterprets the premise involving 'Sophia thinks that Robert suspects...'. Despite the hint in the prompt, the model erroneously considers 'Sophia's thoughts' as valid pointers to 'Robert's suspicions'. Similar to the first example, it fails to recognize that a character's thoughts or beliefs do not guarantee the knowledge of another character, and therefore, these do not confirm the hypothesis.

<3>
This pattern continues with 'Taylor believes that Joseph knows...'. Again, the individual 'Taylor's' beliefs do not automatically translate into proof of 'Joseph's' knowledge. The model misinterprets the premise leading to incorrect entailment.

Possible reasons for the repeated errors:

1. Ambiguity in Instruction: The prompt mentions that 'the nature of the statement like beliefs or suspicions may not necessarily imply that the premise confirms the hypothesis'. Here, the use of 'may not' could be causing confusion. The model possibly interprets it as 'it could, or it could not,' leading to errors.

2. Absence of Concrete Directives: The prompt lacks clear instructions that differentiate belief or suspicion from the reality of the subjects involved.

To improve the prompt:

1. Provide Clearer Instructions: The directive in the prompt could be more explicit. For example, instead of saying 'beliefs or suspicions may not necessarily imply', it might be better to say 'do not necessarily imply...'.

2. Add Examples: It could be helpful to include some examples for clarity, demonstrating what is meant by entailment and non-entailment, particularly when beliefs and suspicions are involved.

3. Emphasize Independence of Beliefs: The prompt should emphasize that the beliefs or suspicions of one character, the premise, does not inherently determine or provide evidence for the actuality or knowledge of another character, the hypothesis.

4. Simplify Language: The language and sentence structure could be simplified so the model can better comprehend and execute the task.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For each wrong example:

<1> 
In this example, the prompt's directives may be confusing the model. The statement provided: 'Michael believes that James recognizes...' involves beliefs, which the prompt specifies may not necessarily entail that the premise confirms the hypothesis. However, the model erroneously treats 'Michael's belief' as valid evidence of 'James' recognition'. This reveals a misunderstanding of the logical interaction between premise and hypothesis. An attribution of belief from one character doesn't necessarily reflect the actual knowledge of the second character.

<2> 
Here again, the model misinterprets the premise involving 'Sophia thinks that Robert suspects...'. Despite the hint in the prompt, the model erroneously considers 'Sophia's thoughts' as valid pointers to 'Robert's suspicions'. Similar to the first example, it fails to recognize that a character's thoughts or beliefs do not guarantee the knowledge of another character, and therefore, these do not confirm the hypothesis.

Reason for wrong output:
- The model might have misunderstood the task. Emma's assumption of William's belief cannot provide concrete evidence that William actually believes in the stated hypothesis. Therefore, the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'. 
- The complexity and length of the premises and hypotheses might also have led the model to produce the incorrect output.
- The model might have taken Emma's assumption as evidence for William's belief, which is conceptually incorrect.

Possible improvements for the prompt:
1) The prompt might require further simplification and clarification. It could specifically highlight the counter-intuitive nature of the task, which is to treat beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions as not directly validating the hypothesis.
2) The examples given in the instruction could be more diverse to cover a broader scope of possible premises and hypotheses.
3) Removing the complexity and length of the given examples may prevent the model from misunderstanding the task.
4) The distinction between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could be better explained.

Example Analysis:

In the provided example, the model is unable to identify the correct answer due to a misunderstanding of the entailment of beliefs within the sentence.

Question: Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.

In this case, the premise gives information about Taylor's belief concerning the dog's actions. Though this belief is vectored through William's understanding (Taylor believes that William thinks...), it still inherently involves Taylor's belief about the dog's actions (the dog jumps to catch a ball). The hypothesis is essentially a part of the premise without the layer of William's understanding. 

Model's Answer: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The model's mistake seems to originate from its strict interpretation of the guidance provided in the prompt, especially with regards to beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions not directly validating or providing evidence for the knowledge or reality of another character. It appears to overlook that the hypothesis isn't about another character's knowledge or reality but about the initial character (Taylor)'s belief.

To improve the prompt, the following aspects should be considered:
1. Clarification on the flow of beliefs and assumptions: The prompt should clarify that if the beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions of one character (in the premise) concerning a particular situation (not necessarily another character) are carried over into the hypothesis concerning the same situation, that may indicate 'entailment'.
2. Cleaner Explanation: The explanatory note about non-entailment from beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions could be further simplified for better comprehension.
3. Provide diverse examples: Including examples that involve both entailment and non-entailment under different contextual circumstances could increase the utility of the prompt and provide varied training to the AI. It might also offer a more balanced perspective.
4. Explain the concept: The idea of entailment itself is highly abstract and might need better conceptual explanation to help ground the model.
5. Levels of belief: There should be clear instructions on how to approach different levels or layers of belief, assumption, or suspicion as seen in this example.

My current prompt is:
Evaluate the relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, specifically focusing on when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are involved. It is crucial to understand that a character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions in the premise do not directly validate or provide evidence for the knowledge or reality of another character in the hypothesis. Based on this, determine if the premise necessarily leads to the hypothesis, indicating 'entailment', or if the premise doesn't necessarily lead to the hypothesis, indicating 'non-entailment'. Be sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if the premise is 'Anna believes that Bob knows something' and the hypothesis is 'Bob knows something', the correct answer would be 'non-entailment' because Anna's belief does not automatically validate Bob's knowledge.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example Analysis:

In the provided example, the model is unable to identify the correct answer due to a misunderstanding of the entailment of beliefs within the sentence.

Question: Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.

In this case, the premise gives information about Taylor's belief concerning the dog's actions. Though this belief is vectored through William's understanding (Taylor believes that William thinks...), it still inherently involves Taylor's belief about the dog's actions (the dog jumps to catch a ball). The hypothesis is essentially a part of the premise without the layer of William's understanding. 

Model's Answer: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The model's mistake seems to originate from its strict interpretation of the guidance provided in the prompt, especially with regards to beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions not directly validating or providing evidence for the knowledge or reality of another character. It appears to overlook that the hypothesis isn't about another character's knowledge or reality but about the initial character (Taylor)'s belief.

To improve the prompt, the following aspects should be considered:
1. Clarification on the flow of beliefs and assumptions: The prompt should clarify that if the beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions of one character (in the premise) concerning a particular situation (not necessarily another character) are carried over into the hypothesis concerning the same situation, that may indicate 'entailment'.
2. Cleaner Explanation: The explanatory note about non-entailment from beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions could be further simplified for better comprehension.
3. Provide diverse examples: Including examples that involve both entailment and non-entailment under different contextual circumstances could increase the utility of the prompt and provide varied training to the AI. It might also offer a more balanced perspective.
4. Explain the concept: The idea of entailment itself is highly abstract and might need better conceptual explanation to help ground the model.
5. Levels of belief: There should be clear instructions on how to approach different levels or layers of belief, assumption, or suspicion as seen in this example.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, taking into account the role of beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions. Identify whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Be specific in presenting the answer between <answer> and </answer>, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, the nature of the statement like beliefs or suspicions may not necessarily imply that the premise confirms the hypothesis.
(2) Evaluate the relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, specifically focusing on when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are involved. It is crucial to understand that a character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions in the premise do not directly validate or provide evidence for the knowledge or reality of another character in the hypothesis. Based on this, determine if the premise necessarily leads to the hypothesis, indicating 'entailment', or if the premise doesn't necessarily lead to the hypothesis, indicating 'non-entailment'. Be sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if the premise is 'Anna believes that Bob knows something' and the hypothesis is 'Bob knows something', the correct answer would be 'non-entailment' because Anna's belief does not automatically validate Bob's knowledge.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Determine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, bearing in mind the concept of 'entailment'. Entailment refers to cases where the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the truth of the premise. Now, pay attention particularly when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions of a character in the narrative are involved. Note that the character's belief, assumption, or suspicion does not directly prove or contribute evidence to the reality of another character in the hypothesis. However, when these notions concern a situation or event, and the same is reflected in the hypothesis, it could imply 'entailment'. Therefore, decide whether the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or doesn't necessarily do so (non-entailment) on a case-by-case basis. When providing your response, choose 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and make sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Chris believes the game is understandable', the correct answer would be 'entailment', as Chris' belief about Jack's understanding implies that Chris also perceives the game as understandable. On the contrary, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Jack understands the game', the correct answer is 'non-entailment', as Chris' belief cannot confirm Jack's understanding. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For this example:

The model appears to misunderstand the key differences between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise involved Michael suspecting a claim Charles makes about a specific situation, while the hypothesis is regarding Michael's direct suspicion about the situation, not Charles'. The model seems to not perceive the importance of the source of suspicion and the level of separation of a belief, assumption, or suspicion from the main proposition under consideration, hence the wrong entailment prediction.

Given these considerations:

1. Unclear instruction: The prompt might have been unclear in instructing the model to differentiate between direct suspicions or beliefs and suspicions or beliefs about someone else's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions. The model didn't acknowledge the additional layer of abstraction present in the premise.

2. Neglect of key details: The model didn't pay adequate attention to who is holding the belief or suspicion in both the premise and hypothesis.

3. Misunderstanding of Beliefs, Assumptions, or Suspicions: The model didn't fully appreciate that holding a belief, assumption, or suspicion about someone else's belief, assumption, or suspicion doesn't automatically entail the same belief, assumption, or suspicion about the underlying proposition.

To improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear that the source of belief, assumption, or suspicion matters significantly. 

2. Clarify that a character's belief, assumption, or suspicion about another character's belief, assumption, or suspicion is distinct and doesn't entail the same belief, assumption, or suspicion about the underlying proposition.

3. Specify that the model should closely examine the level of separation of a belief, assumption, or suspicion from the underlying proposition to make an accurate entailment decision.

4. Add more diverse examples that clearly demonstrate the complexity and nuanced approach needed for accurate entailment/non-entailment determination.

The context provides no evidence that Emma and Ava are the same person, or that they share the information they learn. However, the prompt's language could lead the model to focus on the action (a girl bouncing), rather than the information holder. As a result, the model might have inferred an entailment, which is incorrect.

Example 2:
This example might have confused the model due to the recursive speculation indicating that Sophia suspects what Robert suspects, while the hypothesis is only about what Sophia suspects, not involving Robert. The model might not have understood the nuance that Sophia suspecting something does not mean it's a certainty, which prevents a direct entailment.

Possible improvements:
1. Make it clear that the model should consider who holds the information and whether it's shared, as in the first wrong example.
2. Explain that suspicions, beliefs, or assumptions, no matter how many times they are transferred between people, are not confirmation or denial of the hypothesis. They need direct assertions for entailment.
3. Highlight the need for the model to examine the context and specifics of the premise. Assertions must be unambiguous and direct in order for an entailment to occur. It should lose focus on common elements but rather focus on who, where, and when to compare both sentences. 
4. Add Guidelines for how to handle nested or recursive statements, like in the second wrong example. The model should recognize these as more complex and requiring more scrutiny.
5. Encourage the model to exercise caution and lean more toward "non-entailment" when statements are indirect or ambiguous.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Analysis of example 1:

The first example is about a premise where Taylor 'suspects' something about David. However, the hypothesis assumes this suspicion as a fact. The model made a mistake treating the suspicion as an established fact, so it marked 'entailment' instead of 'non-entailment'. The prompt might have led to this error by not sufficiently emphasizing that beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions don't directly establish a fact. 

Analysis of example 2:

In the second example, the premise is about John 'believing' something about Amelia. Yet, the hypothesis takes this belief as a fact. The model incurred in the same error as example 1, interpreting the belief as an established fact leading to an 'entailment' although it should be 'non-entailment'. The prompt probably led to this error because it does not clarify enough that a belief or assumption does not establish a direct fact or confirmation.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. The prompt should stress that the model must evaluate premises carefully and remember that beliefs, suspicions, and assumptions don't form a factual basis. These are not to be considered as direct affirmation.

2. Additionally, the language could be simplified and clearer in what the model is supposed to do. The complexity might lead to interpretational errors.

3. The prompt should also indicate that when evaluating whether the premise supports the hypothesis, it's critical that only factual and unambiguous statements are considered entailments, not beliefs or suspicions.

4. Another improvement could be to use real-life examples to provide a more practical and intuitive understanding.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Example:
"Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that the tennis player is playing tennis."

Wrong Answer Reasoning:
The first possible reason for the incorrect answer is that the model misunderstands the nature of entailment. The premise "Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line" implicitly validates that the tennis player is playing tennis since spiking the tennis ball is an act of playing. The model has failed to associate this context and thus given an incorrect output 'non-entailment.'

2. The prompt's overly complex language could potentially confuse the model. With phrases like "remembering that statements of beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions need direct assertions to establish entailment," the model could overcomplicate the entailment process. This could lead the model to look for a direct verbal confirmation of hypothesis in premise, not allowing room for implicitly expressed entailments.

3. There is confusion between subtlety and the requirement for directness. The prompt stresses that subtleties in direct and indirect assertions are important, but it also emphasizes “direct assertions” and unambiguity. This might cause the model to lean towards explicit unambiguous entailment. The balance needed between these two aspects may not be handled correctly.

4. The model may also have failed to understand the situation-specific context. The task involves having a broader understanding of real-world situations. Here, for example, it's a fact that spiking a ball happens while playing tennis. The model needs to recognize this contextual fact to answer correctly.

All these aspects could be considered to improve the prompt:

1. Simplify language: Make the instructions more accessible. Avoid overly complicated phrases.

2. Clarify entailment: Ensure the model understands that entailment can be both implicit and explicit. It doesn't always have to be a word-for-word match.

3. Define 'direct': The prompt emphasizes 'direct' validation. If it doesn't mean 'explicit,' this needs clarification.

4. Encourage real-world context usage: The performance on this task can significantly go up if the model starts using more real-world knowledge. Perhaps, hinting towards this in the prompt may help.

2. Clarify entailment: Ensure the model understands that entailment can be both implicit and explicit. It doesn't always have to be a word-for-word match.

3. Define 'direct': The prompt emphasizes 'direct' validation. If it doesn't mean 'explicit,' this needs clarification.

4. Encourage real-world context usage: The performance on this task can significantly go up if the model starts using more real-world knowledge. Perhaps, hinting towards this in the prompt may help.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, taking into account the role of beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions. Identify whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Be specific in presenting the answer between <answer> and </answer>, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, the nature of the statement like beliefs or suspicions may not necessarily imply that the premise confirms the hypothesis.
(2) Examine the provided premises and hypotheses, remembering that statements of beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions need direct assertions to establish entailment. You need to identify if the assertion in the premise directly validates the statement in the hypothesis. If so, respond with 'entailment'. If the premise does not unambiguously support the hypothesis, respond with 'non-entailment'. Present your answer enclosed between <answer> and </answer> tags. This task involves understanding the subtleties of direct and indirect assertions so ensure to critically assess if the premise unequivocally affirms the hypothesis or not.

This could include common beliefs, assumptions or general knowledge about the world. Your task is to identify if the premise endorses the hypothesis either directly or indirectly. If you can clearly derive the hypothesis from the premise, respond with 'entailment'. If there is ambiguity or the premise lacks sufficient information to support the hypothesis, respond with 'non-entailment'. Please provide your answer between <answer> and </answer> tags. Bear in mind that an entailment doesn't have to be a word-for-word match but follows logically from the premise. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava suspects that Michael believes that an older woman is looking at herself in the mirror at a table with cosmetics. Hypothesis: Ava suspects that an older woman is looking at herself in the mirror at a table with cosmetics.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The failure in the model's response suggests a misunderstanding or misinterpretation in the logical consistency between the premise and hypothesis.

1) Failure to Accurately Deduce Complex Relationship: The model does not pick up on the nuanced difference in the perspective being presented in the premise and hypothesis. The premise infers a belief held by a third entity (Michael), the hypothesis states a direct belief from Ava. The complex relationship of these beliefs seems to be misjudged by the model which is leading it away from non-entailment.

2) Failure to Understand 'Suspects' vs 'Believes': The model does not seem to accurately understand the difference between 'suspected' and 'believed'. Suspecting something does not automatically make it a belief. This may have led the AI model to think that Ava's suspicion automatically translates into a belief about the older woman, leading to a conclusion of entailment.

3) Literal Interpretation: The model is focused on the fact that the situation described in the premise and hypothesis are the same, and may not take into account the diverse implications of the attitudes (suspecting vs believing) of different actors involved. 

Improving the prompt:
Considering these issues, improvements to the prompt could be the following:

1) Additional Specific Instruction: Given the difficulty in distinguishing 'suspects' and 'believes', more explicit instructions could be provided to the model to navigate these conceptual differences. 

2) Embedding Complexity: The prompt could stress more upon the importance of the logical entity i.e., who is the subject holding the belief in the premise and hypothesis. 

3) Handling Nuances: The prompt could instruct the model to analyze the perspective of the actors involved and consider the strength of the belief (suspects vs believes).

4) More Detailed Options: Including more detailed response options could also help. Instead of just 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', options to describe partial entailment or unrelated concepts may result in a more accurate response. 

5) Emphasizing Confirmations vs Assumptions: The prompt could more clearly ask the model to focus on distinguish between assumptions and confirmations in the premise and hypothesis.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

The prompt asks the model to determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. In this case, the model chose a non-entailment relationship, which implies that the premise doesn't necessarily suggest the given hypothesis. However, the correct answer is entailment. This indicates that the model had a problem in analyzing the logical relationship and understanding the textual nuances between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise here talks about Thomas recognizing two boys, while the hypothesis points out that these two boys are in a classroom at their desks - which is not mentioned in the premise. This shows that despite the model's capability of processing the text at a phrase or sentence level, it struggles with deeper level semantic representation and entity relations.

Wrong Example 2:

In this case, the model wrongly chose entailment, suggesting that it believes the premise implies the hypothesis. The premise discusses James' belief about Richard understanding something, whereas the hypothesis suggests that Richard understands that thing directly. This discrepancy – James's belief versus Richard's own understanding – seems not well-understood by the model. It seems the model struggles with properly interpreting complex sentences and capturing the subtle differences between 'X believes Y understands' and 'Y understands'.

In summary, the wrong examples make it clear that the model has difficulty in understanding semantic representations and entity relationships, as well as analyzing complex sentences and discerning subtle relational nuances. To improve the prompt, the following recommendations can be considered:

1. When clarifying how to analyze the relationship between premises and hypotheses, provide examples.
2. Include an explicit statement asking the model to evaluate whether all elements of the hypothesis are present and clear in the premise.
3. Ask the model to take into consideration the nuanced details such as indirect and direct relations between entities, degree of certainty, and the source of information.
4. Incorporate a step in the prompt that pushes the model to inspect if there are any phrases that could pose ambiguity, and to treat them carefully.

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the premise does entail the hypothesis since three young girls and a baby imply four people. The model likely picks a wrong answer because the details in the premise (sitting in the grass, blue blanket, baby toys) could have confused the model. The model might have focused more on the details rather than the core concept of the number of people.

<2> 
The premise in the second example clearly entails the hypothesis since spiking a tennis ball necessarily implies that the person is playing tennis. The model's mistake could be attributed to an inability to recognize the implicit link between specific actions (like spiking a ball) with broader contexts (like playing tennis).

In this example, the difference between 'Joseph suspects' and 'Isabella learns' might have contributed to the error. The use of words 'suspects' and 'learns' might have shifted the model's focus from the core events to the actions of the characters, leading to incorrect inferences. 

Based on these observations, the prompt could be improved with the following aspects:

1. Clear emphasis on logic: The model could be better guided to focus on the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, even when the premise contains multiple descriptive details that seem unrelated.
   
2. Context understanding: The prompt should stress that the model needs to fully understand the whole context of the situation. For example, specific actions might imply broader scenarios (like spiking a ball implying playing tennis).
   
3. Nuance detection: The prompt should highlight the need to distinguish between different nuances in wording. For example, 'suspects' versus 'learns' might change the entailment of the sentences.
   
4. Core concept focus: The model needs to focus on the core concept/event when deciding whether the premise entails the hypothesis. Extraneous details should not interfere with the core logical relationship.
   
The revised prompt could be:
"Analyze the logical relationship between the given premises and the hypotheses. You are to focus primarily on the key concept or the main event. Remember, the premise entails the hypothesis if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise. Also, take note of intricacies like assumptions versus confirmations. Does the premise entail the hypothesis, or does it not? Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Indicate your answer by enclosing it within <answer> and </answer>."

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this example, the premise does entail the hypothesis since three young girls and a baby imply four people. The model likely picks a wrong answer because the details in the premise (sitting in the grass, blue blanket, baby toys) could have confused the model. The model might have focused more on the details rather than the core concept of the number of people.

<2> 
The premise in the second example clearly entails the hypothesis since spiking a tennis ball necessarily implies that the person is playing tennis. The model's mistake could be attributed to an inability to recognize the implicit link between specific actions (like spiking a ball) with broader contexts (like playing tennis).

The model's response is: 
The premise does not completely support the hypothesis as it only states that Charlotte remembers David assuming something, but it does not confirm that David actually assumes it. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Olivia suspecting a man dressed only in a towel in a sauna does not necessarily mean she suspects a human not wearing any clothes in a room. The specific context of the sauna and the man being in a towel does not directly translate to a general situation of a human not wearing any clothes in a room. Therefore, the premise does not completely support all elements of the hypothesis. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Examining the Wrong Answer:
The model's response shows that it is interpreting "X believes Y understands" and "Y understands" as different because it focuses on the verbs (believes and understands) individually. As per the guidelines in the prompt, the model has considered the belief of one entity (Charlotte) about another's assumption (David), as different than the assumption by that entity (David) itself, leading it to a 'non-entailment' conclusion.

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
This demonstrates an understanding mismatch between the task's requirements and the AI's interpretation. Even though the prompt mentions to analyze if 'X believes Y understands' and 'Y understands' are essentially the same, the model is treating them as separate concepts which is leading to the wrong answer.

<2> Examining the Wrong Answer:
In this example, the model's response highlights its problem in handling linguistic ambiguities. The premise refers to a 'man dressed only in towel is in a sauna' while the hypothesis proposes 'a human not wearing any clothes is in a room'. Here, the model is not treating 'man' and 'human' as synonymous entities nor 'dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes' as similar states. This causes the model to view the two statements as differing scenarios, leading it to a 'non-entailment' conclusion. 

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The AI model lacks in managing linguistic subtleties and interpreting the interconnection between contextually similar phrases ('dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes') which leads to distinguished situations.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. To tackle the comprehension problem of 'X believes Y understands', clearly state that if 'X believes Y understands', it is equivalent to saying 'Y understands', unless contradicted by further information in the premise.
2. Specifying that the model should consider synonyms as equivalent entities could prevent scenarios like the second example.
3. Add guidance for recognizing and comparing contextually similar phrases or situations. The equivalence of 'dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes' in specific contexts like a sauna should match. This would aid in linguistic ambiguity concerns.
4. Emphasize on the importance of the premise supporting all key elements of the hypothesis for entailment. If any of the key elements is contradicted or not addressed by the premise, it should be treated as 'non-entailment'.

Example Explanation:
The model has misunderstood the relationship between the premise and hypothesis stated. The model seems to be focusing on the 'observed' perception rather than the 'reported' perception, causing it to miss the entailment present in the sentences. In the given premise, Abigail observes or "sees" that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of the mountain. The hypothesis is simply reporting what Abigail observes or sees Charlotte thinking, making it an entailment.

Overemphasis on linguistic ambiguities: Although it's specified in the prompt to contemplate on potential linguistic ambiguities, the model might have taken this guidance to an unexpected extent, leading to misinterpretation of the task. In this case, the model was too focused on the difference between 'Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks' and 'Charlotte thinks', disregarding that Abigail's sight is not a factor for the entailment here.
2. Misunderstanding of the entailment concept: The model incorrectly interpreted entailment to mean that the premise must confirm the exact hypothesis. However, entailment only requires that the hypothesis is a logical outcome or interpretation of the premise, which can include inferred or reported perceptions.
3. Lack of understanding of reported speech: The model lacked the comprehension of the reported speech mechanism that characterized the premise.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Clarify the concept of entailment: The prompt could emphasize that the premise should support the hypothesis, not necessarily confirm it verbatim. It should state explicitly that the hypothesis can be a logical outcome or interpretation of the premise based on the given information.
2. Include guidance on reported speech: Since this task involves nuanced comprehension skills, the prompt could include instructions or guidance on handling reported speech, ensuring that the model does not disregard this kind of information when determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. 
3. Soften ambiguity detection: While still inviting the model to consider potential ambiguities, the prompt could do so in a less rigid manner, perhaps suggesting that not all ambiguities are critical to determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Explore the complex relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, emphasizing on the primary concept or event. Amid your evaluation, take into consideration that the premise should completely support all elements of the hypothesis for the case to be 'entailment'. Contemplate on subtle facets such as direct and indirect kinships between the entities mentioned, their sources of insight, the degree of certainty, and potential linguistic ambiguities. Analyze whether 'X believes Y understands' and 'Y understands' are essentially the same. If you spot any phrases causing ambiguity, handle with discretion. Make sure to choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', incorporating your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain. Hypothesis: Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not completely support all elements of the hypothesis, as it only states that Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks three people are posing on the side of a mountain, but it does not confirm that Charlotte actually thinks that. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example Explanation:
The model has misunderstood the relationship between the premise and hypothesis stated. The model seems to be focusing on the 'observed' perception rather than the 'reported' perception, causing it to miss the entailment present in the sentences. In the given premise, Abigail observes or "sees" that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of the mountain. The hypothesis is simply reporting what Abigail observes or sees Charlotte thinking, making it an entailment.
1. Overemphasis on linguistic ambiguities: Although it's specified in the prompt to contemplate on potential linguistic ambiguities, the model might have taken this guidance to an unexpected extent, leading to misinterpretation of the task. In this case, the model was too focused on the difference between 'Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks' and 'Charlotte thinks', disregarding that Abigail's sight is not a factor for the entailment here.
2. Misunderstanding of the entailment concept: The model incorrectly interpreted entailment to mean that the premise must confirm the exact hypothesis. However, entailment only requires that the hypothesis is a logical outcome or interpretation of the premise, which can include inferred or reported perceptions.
3. Lack of understanding of reported speech: The model lacked the comprehension of the reported speech mechanism that characterized the premise.

Improvement Aspects:

<START> Scrutinize the given premise and the hypothesis, concentrating on the main idea or event. Keep in mind that for the case to be an 'entailment', it is not necessary for the premise to confirm the hypothesis outright, but rather the hypothesis should logically follow from or can be inferred from the premise. Dive into details such as the direct and indirect relationships between the entities involved, their way of perceiving things, and the level of certainty presented. However, be cautious not to dwell too much on potential linguistic ambiguities. While comparing phrases like 'X perceives Y believes' and 'Y believes', remember that entailment can exist even in reported observations. In case of ambiguity, assess it carefully, understanding that not all ambiguities interrupt the entailment.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the error that arises from the prompt seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the hyper-specificity of the premise compared to the generality of the hypothesis. The prompt tends to make the language model overanalyze the details of the premise, leading it to make an incorrect conclusion that the premise does not support the hypothesis due to lack of direct mention of a person holding a racket. The model fails to realize that a 'tennis player making an aggressive backhand swing' implicitly suggests the person is holding a tennis racket. 

The improvement for this is to clarify in the prompt that the model needs to interpret the phrases and make implied connections where common sense or general knowledge applies.

<2> 
In the second example, the prompt's issue is with the model's handling of belief statements. In the prompt, it instructs the model to evaluate the sentence 'X believes Y understands' and 'Y understands' essentially the same. The model likely interprets this as implying that the belief of understanding does not equate to actual understanding, hence predicting non-entailment. However, the hypothesis does not require that William actually understands, only that Taylor believes he does.

The improvement could be to specifically guide the language model to recognize that belief statements may just be a layer of perception added onto an event or fact, and its presence or absence should not affect the event/fact's acknowledgment.

Overall improvements to the prompt will include: 

1. Clearly instructing the model to connect the indications implied in the premise, not just the explicit phrases.
2. Guiding the model that belief statements are a layer of perception, and their presence or absence does not affect the validity of the event/fact being acknowledged.
3. Confirming that the model comprehends that the premise need not directly specify every aspect of the hypothesis in explicit terms, due to the possibility of inferred understanding based on the premise's context. This will help to avoid over-analysis or hyper-literal interpretation.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The prompt heavily emphasizes the need to find direction or indirect connections, implicit inferences, and the distinctions between belief and understanding. However, it seems to underemphasize the importance of explicit connections, which might have led the model to choosing the wrong answer in this case. Here, the hypothesis, “Joseph assumes that a man is jumping” is explicitly stated within the premise, “Joseph assumes that the man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open,” where the act of a man jumping is explicitly mentioned.

<2> 
The same emphasis on indirect and implicit connections, and the distinctions between belief and understanding that led to the wrong answer in Example 1 also contributed to the wrong answer in Example 2. Inasmuch as the prompt tells the model to discern if 'Y understands' is fundamentally the same as 'X believes Y understands', it does not extend this understanding to scenarios where the subject remains constant but the observer changes. This leads to considering the statements "Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping" and "Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping” as the same when in reality the understandings of Ava and Emma may be different.

Recommendations:
The prompt could be improved by providing clearer instructions such as emphasizing the relevance of explicit connections, advising the model to consider changes in observer perspectives, and to also critically analyze who holds the belief or assumption. Instructions to consult context in case of ambiguity could also be included. In order to solve comprehension tasks of this nature, it may be helpful to incorporate instructions that can handle varied scenarios including ones where the premise or hypothesis is embedded within complex linguistic constructions.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, with a main focus on the key concept or event. Remember, for the case to be 'entailment', the premise should wholly support the hypothesis, but not necessarily in explicit terms. Understand that the premise may imply aspects of the hypothesis without directly stating them. Take into account implicit connections inferred from general knowledge or common sense. Look into all aspects such as the direct or indirect connection between the entities mentioned, their avenues of understanding, the level of certainty, and potential linguistic uncertainties. Analyze statements of belief, like 'X believes Y understands', understanding that the belief is a perception layer added onto the event or fact, and its presence or absence does not change the essence of the event or fact.

<START> Analyze the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on the central concept or event. The connection could be direct or indirect. The scenario is 'entailment' only when the premise fully supports the hypothesis, both explicitly or implicitly. The premise can suggest aspects of the hypothesis without directly mentioning them. Consider both explicit and implicit connections, especially those suggested by general knowledge or common sense. Reflect not only on the connection between the entities involved but also their perspectives, the degree of certainty, and possible linguistic ambiguities. Evaluate belief statements like 'X believes Y understands', realizing that the belief adds a layer of perception to the event or fact and doesn't change its fundamental nature. Be aware that 'Y understands' and 'X believes Y understands' might hold different implications. Also, consider who holds the belief or assumption as perspectives may differ. Approach any ambiguous phrases with careful scrutiny. After considering all these aspects, make a judgment between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', ensuring that your decision is displayed in the format <answer> and </answer>.

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
Reason for Incorrect Result: 
The model might be overemphasizing and misinterpreting the 'X believes Y understands' structure in the prompt. The premise 'Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction' makes it clear that Michael has a suspicion about Charles' knowledge. The hypothesis is about Michael's suspicion only and doesn't touch Charles' learning, making it a subset of the premise and thereby making the scenario one of 'entailment'.

<2>
Reason for Incorrect Result: 
Again, the model seems to wrongly apply the 'X believes Y understands' logic here. While the premise began with 'Michael believes', translating this into the hypothesis 'James recognizes' is not right since belief doesn't entail recognition. So, in this case, the model should have identified it as 'non-entailment' because Michael's belief doesn't necessarily mean James recognizing the situation described.

<3> 
Reason for Incorrect Result: 
The model does not seem to recognize that the belief of a third party (Abigail) does not necessarily translate into the knowledge of another party (Emma). 'Abigail believes that Emma knows' does not entail 'Emma knows'. The belief of Abigail does not guarantee the knowledge of Emma.

Improvements to the Prompt:
1. Specify that the 'X believes Y understands' example is used to elucidate the idea of perception layers and does not imply that belief or suspicion automatically entail understanding, knowledge, recognition, etc.
2. Reinforce the understanding that recognition, belief, understanding, knowledge etc are different and may not lead to one another.
3. Highlight the importance of comparing the situations described in the premise and the hypothesis rather than merely comparing the verbs (believe, understand, suspect etc.).
4. Underline the importance of referring to the context and the explicit information provided in each scenario.
5. Recommend comparing both premise and hypothesis without losing sight of their details while trying to fit into 'X believes Y understands' or other such narrative structures. Based on this comparison, the choice of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' should be made.
6. Emphasize the understanding that the retelling or representation of an event in a belief statement can subtly alter the meaning, and that care should be taken while dealing with these transformations.
7. The phrase 'believe' or 'suspect' does not necessarily establish an entailment because what is believed or suspected could be false. Further specify that base facts/events within these structures should be analyzed for their potential to establish entailment.

5. Recommend comparing both premise and hypothesis without losing sight of their details while trying to fit into 'X believes Y understands' or other such narrative structures. Based on this comparison, the choice of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' should be made.
6. Emphasize the understanding that the retelling or representation of an event in a belief statement can subtly alter the meaning, and that care should be taken while dealing with these transformations.
7. The phrase 'believe' or 'suspect' does not necessarily establish an entailment because what is believed or suspected could be false. Further specify that base facts/events within these structures should be analyzed for their potential to establish entailment.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, focusing on the core concept/event. Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, and factor in subtle nuances like assumptions versus confirmations. Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and bracket your answer between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Explore the complex relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, emphasizing on the primary concept or event. Amid your evaluation, take into consideration that the premise should completely support all elements of the hypothesis for the case to be 'entailment'. Contemplate on subtle facets such as direct and indirect kinships between the entities mentioned, their sources of insight, the degree of certainty, and potential linguistic ambiguities. Analyze whether 'X believes Y understands' and 'Y understands' are essentially the same. If you spot any phrases causing ambiguity, handle with discretion. Make sure to choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', incorporating your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Carefully examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, with a main focus on the key concept or event. Remember, for the case to be 'entailment', the premise should wholly support the hypothesis, but not necessarily in explicit terms. Understand that the premise may imply aspects of the hypothesis without directly stating them. Take into account implicit connections inferred from general knowledge or common sense. Look into all aspects such as the direct or indirect connection between the entities mentioned, their avenues of understanding, the level of certainty, and potential linguistic uncertainties. Analyze statements of belief, like 'X believes Y understands', understanding that the belief is a perception layer added onto the event or fact, and its presence or absence does not change the essence of the event or fact. Also, try to discern if 'Y understands' is fundamentally the same as 'X believes Y understands'. Exercise tact when dealing with phrases that could cause ambiguity.

<START> Carefully scrutinize the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, laying emphasis on the core concept or event. Assessment of 'entailment' mandates that the premise wholly supports the hypothesis, either implied or explicit. Also note that belief or suspicion by an individual does not necessarily establish the understanding, knowledge or recognition of the said matter by another individual. Therefore, 'X believes Y understands' does not necessarily imply that 'Y understands' and these must be treated as separate events unless explicit connection is made. Dig into intricate aspects such as linguistic uncertainties and direct or indirect connections between the entities. Always bear in mind that belief, recognition, understanding or knowledge are distinct and their implication may vary with the scenario. The premise may not always directly state its connection to the hypothesis, so implications based on general knowledge or common sense may be valid. When developed ambiguity due to unclear phrases occurs, handle with discretion. Your task is to identify 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on your analysis, framing your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>. Ensure you examine each case on its own merit rather than comparing it to existing templates such as the 'X believes Y understands'.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:

In the first example, the statement's context is based on Charles's assumptions. The language model might not understand that Charles's assumption, which includes detailed information, wholly supports the hypothesis that the two women are caring for a herd of animals. The direction in the prompt to analyze statements of belief (like 'X believes Y understands') does encourage this interpretation, but it seems the instruction was insufficiently clear. Stating explicitly that when 'X assumes Y', 'Y' is likely true within the narrative provided could make it clearer for the model.

For Example 2:

The second example seems again to stumble over the directive to analyze belief-based statements. Similar to example 1, even though the statement is a belief by Joseph recognising what John thinks, the hypothesis is in fact covered by the premise regardless of its layered nature. Including more explicit instructions to identify belief-based statements when they are embedded within others could make this clearer.

For Example 3:

In the third example, the model appears to fail to recognize the shift in subjects from the premise to the hypothesis. In the premise, it's William who suspects, but in the hypothesis, it's Taylor who suspects. The prompt doesn't clearly establish that consistency in subjects from premise to hypothesis is necessary for entailment. An addition in the instructions to emphasize the importance of subject continuity could help improve the model's accuracy in these scenarios.

Summary:

To improve the prompt:

1) Include explicit instructions to recognize and accept as truthful belief-based statements such as 'X thinks Y' or 'X assumes Y' within the narrative provided.

2) Add instructions to acknowledge the presence of belief-based statements layered within others and to understand that they can still support the hypothesis.

3) Include guidance that emphasizes subject continuity from premise to hypothesis is required for entailment. 

4) Make it clear that overall comprehension of the narrative requires interpreting whether the premise (however complex) supports the hypothesis. This may include dealing with multilayered belief-based statements, perceiving the consistency of subjects, or understanding implicit connections.

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
In this example, the premise suggests that 'Richard believes' that Joseph knows something. This does not explicitly confirm that Joseph does indeed know it, only that Richard believes he does. This subtle distinction in context may have confused the model, leading to an incorrect selection of 'entailment' when it should have been 'non-entailment'.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
Similar to the first example, there is a misleading wording in the context of the premise: 'Taylor suspects that David recognizes...' Again, it indicates Taylor's suspicions, not a confirmation of David's recognition. The model mistakenly saw it as a direct link, leading to an incorrect prediction of 'entailment'.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Increase Clarity: Clarify that the model should not assume 'entailment' just because one character believes, suspects, or predicts another character's knowledge or action. This needs to be explicitly stated as it might be confusing and lead to an incorrect prediction.
2. Emphasize on Subtlety: The prompt should underscore the importance of scrutinizing minor variations in context and wording that adjust the overall meaning. 
3. Define Terms: Specifically define terms like 'entailment' in relation to the task at hand. The term 'entailment' is somewhat technical and its definition may vary slightly depending on the context, this can help avoid any confusion. 
4. Include more Examples: The prompt might benefit from one or two examples of each option to aid the model in understanding the concepts.
5. Focus on Belief or Assumption: The prompt should specify that the premise's belief or assumption does not guarantee the hypothesis' truth, which has not been clear enough in the current version.

<START> Analyze the logical relationship between the given premises and corresponding hypotheses, directing your attention towards the central event or essential concept. Be aware that 'entailment' requires that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must unconditionally also be true. However, take note of subtle distinctions within the context or wording. Characters' beliefs or suspicions about others' awareness or actions do not necessarily confirm these assumptions. Be cautious not to mistake assumptions or beliefs for confirmations of truth. Your task involves identifying whether or not the premise results in the hypothesis. To achieve this, take the option 'entailment' if the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or otherwise, 'non-entailment'. The terms essentially mean that 'entailment' suggests the hypothesis is unequivocally caused or brought about by the premise, whereas 'non-entailment' suggests it is not.

gradient:
Wrong Examples Examination:

<1>
In this example, the model fails to notice the nuance between 'Amelia suspects that Sophia thinks' and 'Sophia thinks'. The premise involves Amelia's suspicion, it is not definite that Sophia thinks the same way due to the layer of doubt introduced by Amelia's suspicion.

<2>
Similar to example 1, there is a degree of doubt introduced in the premise in this example by the phrase 'Sophia suspects that Robert suspects'. The model does not cater to this uncertainty and assumes the hypothesis to be true. 

<3>
Here, the model overlooks the vital detail of whose view the premise is according to. The premise presents Taylor's suspicion. However, this does not guarantee that Isabella indeed thinks the same way.

<4>
This example carries the same error pattern. The premise is 'Robert believes that Thomas knows', but the hypothesis suggests that Thomas actually knows, ignoring the potential of Robert being mistaken in his belief.

Summary of Problems with the Prompt:
1. The prompt does not reinforce the importance of considering degrees of uncertainty in premises. In each of the cases, the premise was not a conclusive fact but rather a belief, suspicion, or view of another person.
2. The model focuses on the main event or key concept but does not sufficiently account for the nuances in context.
3. The model seems to misinterpret premises that involve an assessment of someone else's thoughts or beliefs, autonomously confirming these without considering the inherent doubts.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. The prompt should clearly state that the model must consider the degree of certainty in the premise. It can be rephrased to emphasize that if the premise mentions a belief, suspicion, or view, it does not guarantee the validity of the hypothesis.
2. The model should be instructed to pay more attention not just to the main event or elements, but also to the context and the specific language used to describe them.
3. Reframe the prompt to underline the importance of scrutinizing premises that involve someone's perception or assumption of someone else's thoughts or beliefs. This can prevent the model from making inappropriate entailment decisions.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Examples Examination:

<1>
In this example, the model fails to notice the nuance between 'Amelia suspects that Sophia thinks' and 'Sophia thinks'. The premise involves Amelia's suspicion, it is not definite that Sophia thinks the same way due to the layer of doubt introduced by Amelia's suspicion.

<2>
Similar to example 1, there is a degree of doubt introduced in the premise in this example by the phrase 'Sophia suspects that Robert suspects'. The model does not cater to this uncertainty and assumes the hypothesis to be true. 

<3>
Here, the model overlooks the vital detail of whose view the premise is according to. The premise presents Taylor's suspicion. However, this does not guarantee that Isabella indeed thinks the same way.

<4>
This example carries the same error pattern. The premise is 'Robert believes that Thomas knows', but the hypothesis suggests that Thomas actually knows, ignoring the potential of Robert being mistaken in his belief.

Summary of Problems with the Prompt:
1. The prompt does not reinforce the importance of considering degrees of uncertainty in premises. In each of the cases, the premise was not a conclusive fact but rather a belief, suspicion, or view of another person.
2. The model focuses on the main event or key concept but does not sufficiently account for the nuances in context.
3. The model seems to misinterpret premises that involve an assessment of someone else's thoughts or beliefs, autonomously confirming these without considering the inherent doubts.

Suggestions for Improvement:
1. The prompt should clearly state that the model must consider the degree of certainty in the premise. It can be rephrased to emphasize that if the premise mentions a belief, suspicion, or view, it does not guarantee the validity of the hypothesis.
2. The model should be instructed to pay more attention not just to the main event or elements, but also to the context and the specific language used to describe them.
3. Reframe the prompt to underline the importance of scrutinizing premises that involve someone's perception or assumption of someone else's thoughts or beliefs. This can prevent the model from making inappropriate entailment decisions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, focusing on the core concept/event. Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, and factor in subtle nuances like assumptions versus confirmations. Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and bracket your answer between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Thoroughly examine the logical relationship between the provided premises and the corresponding hypotheses, prioritizing the main event or the key concept. It's crucial to establish whether the premise, in its entirety, entails the hypothesis. This means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. Remember to discern between assumptions, confirmations, and pay careful attention to the subtle differences in wording or context. Based on this analysis, decide if the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Make your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Finally, enclose your chosen answer with <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Lack of Emphasis on Sentence Structure: The prompt does not heavily emphasize the fact that the order and structure of the sentences can often be the deciding factor regarding whether a premise entails a hypothesis. The model may not have factored in the direction of suspicion in the hypothesis and the premise, which is crucial in this case resulting in an incorrect inference.

2. Misinterpretation of Logical Relationships: The prompt instructs the model to consider if the premise entails the hypothesis, meaning if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. In this case, The premise is that "Joseph knows that James suspects that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna." However, the hypothesis is "James suspects that Joseph knows that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna." The logical direction of suspicion is reversed in the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not naturally entail the hypothesis. The model doesn't seem to fully grasp this concept, as per the current instruction in the prompt.

3. Over-reliance on the Truth Statements: The existing prompt has a heavy focus on whether the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true. However, with complex sentences, this isn't always the case as the hypothesis can be ‘true’ without the premise necessarily being true. It's possible that the model interprets the consistency of the narrative between the premise and hypothesis as an entailment.

4. Insufficient Guidance on Discerning Assumption: The prompt’s direction to discern assumption isn't sufficiently clear. Without fully understanding this, the AI might have generalized the premise's information to apply to the hypothesis, leading to the mistake.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Incorporate more lucid instruction on the analysis of sentence structure and order. Encourage the model to recognize that alteration of a sentence's structure can change the entire meaning.

2. Detail the prompt to better explain and understand the logical relationship between statements. Expressly state that simple truth consistency between the premise and hypothesis doesn't necessarily equate to entailment.

3. Provide more explicit guidelines on how to discern and evaluate assumptions. Information present in the premise shouldn't be generalized to apply to the hypothesis.
   
4. Place more emphasis on context. Include instructions in the prompt to ensure that the model is considering the broader context within which the premise and hypothesis are presented.

5. Creating smaller subtasks might help. Instead of asking the model to do everything at once, it can first determine whether the premise could be true if the hypothesis is false, and vice versa. Only if both are "no" is the answer entailment. This can discourage the model from assuming entailment if there's narrative consistency in the statements.

Wrong Answer: The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Correct Answer: (B) non-entailment

Analyzing the Question and Wrong Answer:
The task is about judging the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Drawing the wrong answer may stem from potential flaws in the prompt and model's understanding. 

1. The model seems to disregard the difference between direct and indirect assumption. In this case, the initial premise contains an indirect assumption, “Taylor believes that Joseph knows…” rather than a direct confirmation that Joseph knows.
2. The model failed to correctly understand and interpret the cues regarding epistemic modality existing in the prompt, specifically the contrast between belief and knowledge. 
3. The model also falsely equates the shared content between the premise and hypothesis as proof of entailment, despite the different sources of the information.
4. The teaching to not "assume that only similarities in object- or person-description result in entailment" could have been interpreted by the model too expansively, understanding it as suggesting that even slight similarities in content can indicate entailment.

Areas of improvement for the prompt:

1. The prompt can benefit by emphasizing the difference between first-hand information and information gained from other sources. The complex difference between beliefs and factual knowledge should be stressed.
2. The instruction on similarity might be too vague; the model may benefit from a more explicit instruction about when shared content can be seen as entailment.
3. It could specify that a belief held by one person does not automatically translate into factual knowledge for another. The conversion from belief to knowledge needs to be from the same viewpoint.
4. The language of the prompt could be made more accessible. It currently appears quite academic, which may contribute to potential misunderstandings on the part of the model. It can be revised to a simpler, more straightforward language.
5. The prompt might need to provide a clearer description of what entailment and non-entailment mean in the context of attributing assumptions and viewpoints.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution with careful consideration of epistemic modalities. Remember to evaluate whether indirect assumption, information attributed to another person's viewpoint or similar elements are present in the premise and hypothesis. Also, recall that entailment is determined not just by shared content, but also the source and pathway of the information.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. The premise states that David remembers that Richard assumes a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd, but it does not necessarily mean that Richard actually assumes that. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The model seems to fail by not differentiating between the source of the information and the attribution of the belief. Even though the premise is reported through the consciousness of David, Richard's assumption still holds. The prompt needs to make it clearer that the pathway of the information doesn't necessarily change the conclusion if it is well established in the premise.

<2> 
In the second example, the model appears to struggle with the generalization of "guy" being equal to "man" and "sweatshirt" being equal to "gray sweatshirt". The prompt should emphasize the relevance of similar descriptions and how slight changes in person or object descriptions don't necessarily result in non-entailment. 

<3> 
This third example is similar to the first one. The model again fails to understand that the assumption made by a character (Charles in this case) remains true, regardless of whether it's reported by another character (Richard). This issue may be due to the prompt's overemphasis on the source and pathway of the information. Here, the prompt could instruct the model to consider the inherent truth of the proposition when stated within the narrative, regardless of who reports it. 

In summary, to improve the prompt, we could:
1. Make it clear that while source and pathway of the information are important, they don’t necessarily change the truth of directly reported beliefs or assumptions. 
2. Emphasize that entailment can still occur despite small changes or generalizations in object or person descriptions. 
3. Instruct the model to pay attention to the narrative truth of the argument, meaning whether something is presented as fact within the narrative, regardless of which character's point of view it comes from.

gradient:
Example 1:
The question is about having the model identify the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, with options being 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The model has incorrectly classified the relationship as 'non-entailment'. This is primarily because the model has not fully understood the concept of 'indirect assumption' explained in the prompt. The task hints at evaluating shared content, sources, and pathways of information, but it appears that the model is failing to do so. This leads to an incorrect interpretation of the premise which consequently affects the evaluation of its relation with the hypothesis.

Example 2:
Similar to the first example, the model wrongly identifies the relationship as a 'non-entailment'. It seems the model is focusing on the direct assumptions rather than the indirect assumptions. The model errs by attributing actuality to David's assumption, which is not required in the prompt, as the prompt states, "information attributed to another person's viewpoint." The focus should be on evaluating the information pathway from Charlotte to David, rather than the validity of David's assumption itself.

Improving The prompt:
The current prompt appears to be challenging for the language model, leading to misunderstandings and incorrect answers. To improve the prompt, consider doing the following:

1. Simplify the Explanations: Language models, although intelligent, may struggle with heavy jargon and technicalities. It might be better to simplify the explanations, particularly related to 'causal attribution', 'epistemic modalities', 'indirect assumption', 'entailment', etc.

2. Clear Up Misconceptions: As observed, the model seems to focus on whether an attributed perspective is accurate, which is not the point of the task. Make it clearer that the task is about evaluating the information pathway rather than the validity of the attributed belief or assumption.

3. Provide Examples: An example of the type of abstraction required for the task could serve as a helpful guide for the model. This could be presented in the form of an example premise and hypothesis that clearly demonstrate 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

4. Use Step-by-step Structure: You might also want to consider simplifying and structuring the prompt into a step-by-step procedure that rigorously instructs the model on how to analyze the premise and hypothesis, and its connection. 

5. Highlight Assessment Areas: You can highlight assessment areas (e.g., content, source, pathway of information, different viewpoints, narrative perspective etc.) to ensure that the AI model pays attention to these when making its decision.

<START> 
Analyzing and answering questions related to causal attribution needs careful thought. Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis is inferred, or 'entailed', from the premise or not.

cur_prompt: For this task, you are expected to analyze and discern the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, with particular attention paid to causality and whether there is a direct or indirect assumption present. Carefully determine if the assertion or claim is based on first-person knowledge or is attributed to another person's viewpoint or assumption. Bear in mind that shared content between premise and hypothesis does not automatically imply entailment. Additionally, the original source of the information and the means by which it was obtained are equally essential. Entailment is not solely based on similarities in object or person descriptions, but also leans heavily on the consistency of the narrative viewpoint. A person's belief does not necessarily translate into confirmable knowledge for another person, and the transition from belief to knowledge needs to stay consistent with the same viewpoint. So, in this task, based on the premise and hypothesis given, identify if the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Remember to frame your response as an answer option at the end.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that the tennis player is playing tennis. 

Wrong Answer Reasoning: The model has predicted the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as 'non-entailment.' This may have been triggered by the model's focus on specifics in the premise (e.g. 'spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line') that are not mentioned in the hypothesis. However, the focus should have been more on the overall context where if a tennis player is spiking a ball, it implies he is playing tennis, which indicates entailment.

Improved Prompt Aspect: The prompt could do more to stress that minor detail differences in the premise and hypothesis do not contraindicate entailment. 

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: The model predicted this as 'non-entailment,' suggesting it might be getting overwhelmed with the nested information about individual viewpoints. Dropping "Michael knows that" from the premise still preserves the core assertion and aligns it with the hypothesis, which makes this entailment.

Improved Prompt Aspect: The prompt should emphasize processing multi-layered information and clarify that dropping information layers can still retain essential details validating entailment.

Wrong Example 3:

Question: Premise: Charles recognizes that a tennis player in blue shorts and a white shirt is making an aggressive backhand swing towards the tennis ball. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: Again, the model has given a 'non-entailment' prediction, possibly due to the specifics (e.g. 'blue shorts', 'white shirt', 'backhand swing') mentioned in the premise not being mirrored in the hypothesis. However, these specifics are incidental. The crucial detail is 'a tennis player', leading to an entailment with a 'person holding a tennis racket'.  

Improved Prompt Aspect: Again, the prompt should do more to communicate that entailment is not negated by superficial differences in detail, but more focused on overarching statements and their implications or contradictions.

On reviewing these examples, the areas for improvement for the prompt seem to be:
1. Better emphasis on overall meanings and implications rather than minute specifics.
2. Stress that removal of layers of information (as seen in viewpoints) can still allow for entailment.
3. Encourage the model to focus on the core information and understand indirect implications to correctly identify entailment and non-entailment.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution with careful consideration of epistemic modalities. Remember to evaluate whether indirect assumption, information attributed to another person's viewpoint or similar elements are present in the premise and hypothesis. Also, recall that entailment is determined not just by shared content, but also the source and pathway of the information. Don't assume that only similarities in object- or person-description result in entailment; it depends on the narrative viewpoint as well.

<START> In this task, your goal is to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Remember that the focus is not on minor or incidental details, but on the broader context and inherent implications of the statements. You need to consider causality, but also keep in mind that any direct or indirect assumptions might present. Exercise careful judgment in identifying if the main assertion arises from first-hand information or is derived from someone else's perspective or supposition. Just because the premise and hypothesis share some content does not immediately point to entailment. Equal importance should be given to the initial source of the information and how it was established. Be aware that entailment not only depends on conspicuous similarities in the description of people or objects. It's also significantly reliant on the coherence of the viewpoint in the narrative, and on whether the removal of certain layers of information still maintains the core content that aligns the premise and the hypothesis. Remember that just because a person believes something, it doesn't mean this belief translates automatically into verifiable knowledge for another individual. The shift from belief to knowledge should maintain consistency with the same viewpoint. Thus, in this assignment, you are asked to identify if the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis equates to 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.’ Please, ensure your response is formatted as one of the given answer options at the end. <END>

So, in this task, based on the premise and hypothesis given, identify if the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Remember to frame your response as an answer option at the end.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reason for wrong answer:
The model appears to have made an incorrect association based on the similarities between the premise and the hypothesis in this case. The model overlooked the fact that the premise is coming from James’ perspective about what Richard understands and not directly from Richard himself. This indicates indirect knowledge or second-hand assumption and not an evidence of a direct understanding which cannot be used to assume entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.

<2> Reason for wrong answer:
In this instance, the model seems to have incorrectly assumed that the knowledge of one person (William) in the premise is essential to Taylor's belief in the hypothesis. This represents a misunderstanding of viewpoint consistency as Taylor's belief is consistent irrespective of William's understanding–leading to an entailment. However, the model incorrectly determined it as a case of non-entailment.

Possible aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Clarify the concept of "viewpoint consistency" - It would be beneficial to further underline that if a belief or understanding remains consistent within a single person's viewpoint across the premise and hypothesis, it should be considered an entailment.
2. Place more emphasis on person's knowledge - Highlight the caution in assuming entailment based on second-hand assumptions or indirect knowledge.
3. Explain the role of shared content more - While it is mentioned in the prompt that shared content between a premise and a hypothesis does not automatically imply entailment, insisting that the main focus should be the logic and understanding across the perspectives might help the model make more accurate decisions.
4. Validate the importance of direct and indirect assumptions - Clearly spell out how discerning a direct assertion from an indirect assertion can crucially impact the deduction of entailment or non-entailment.
5. Provide examples/clarifications to effectively distinguish entailment from non-entailment – It might help the model better understand the task and make more accurate predictions.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
For this task, you are expected to analyze and discern the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, with particular attention paid to causality and whether there is a direct or indirect assumption present. Carefully determine if the assertion or claim is based on first-person knowledge or is attributed to another person's viewpoint or assumption. Bear in mind that shared content between premise and hypothesis does not automatically imply entailment. Additionally, the original source of the information and the means by which it was obtained are equally essential. Entailment is not solely based on similarities in object or person descriptions, but also leans heavily on the consistency of the narrative viewpoint. A person's belief does not necessarily translate into confirmable knowledge for another person, and the transition from belief to knowledge needs to stay consistent with the same viewpoint. So, in this task, based on the premise and hypothesis given, identify if the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Remember to frame your response as an answer option at the end.

<START> In this task, you are charged with the critical analysis of a premise and a hypothesis to decipher their relationship. Determine if these bear an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship. Appraise causality with a fine eye for detailing, and keenly discern if a direct or indirect assumption is insinuated. Further, evaluate whether the assertion is rooted in firsthand information or is an attribution from another individual's perspective or assumption. A significant point to be mindful of is that similar content between a premise and hypothesis does not mandatorily suggest entailment. The original source of the information and the process adopted for its acquisition merit equal importance. Remember, entailment isn't solely pivoted on the similarities in object or person descriptions, but is greatly influenced by a consistent narrative viewpoint. Do not be swayed to assume that an individual's belief invariably converts into confirmable knowledge for another. This transition needs to be viewpoint-consistent. So, establish with precision based on the given premise and hypothesis if the relation is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Whether a belief or understanding remains consistent within a single person's viewpoint in both premise and hypothesis should establish entailment. Exercise care while judging entailment based on second-hand assumptions or indirect knowledge. Pay close attention to the logic and understanding across perspectives. Additionally, it is crucial to differentiate between direct and indirect assertions in ascertaining entailment or non-entailment.

Premise: Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard.

Reason for incorrect response:
The given prompt is placing too much emphasis on the need for consistency in the narrative viewpoint, source of information, and the transition from belief to knowledge. However, it doesn't provide clear emphasis on the comparison of the scenarios or events described in both the premise and hypothesis. This lack of clarity might have made the model to disregard the fact that being in a "garden near a fence in the yard" does entail being "outside in the garden".

Ways to improve the prompt:
1. The prompt should place less emphasis on the need for consistency in the narrative viewpoint, original source of information, and limits of third-person knowledge.
2. It should provide more guidance on the comparison and logical consistency of most elementary scenarios or events encapsulated in the premise and hypothesis.
3. The language model should be prompted to consider the hypothesis as a subset or generalized version of the events or scenarios mentioned in the premise.
4. Instead of asking the model to pay mere "particular attention to causality", it should be more directed to evaluate the implications of the premise and if those implications could suggest the hypothesis. 

Based on these reasons, the improved prompt could be: 

In this task, you need to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Consider if the facts or events mentioned in the premise could suggest or lead to the events or assertions made in the hypothesis. Understand that shared content or similar descriptions in premise and hypothesis does not automatically imply entailment.

   prompt: Evaluate the relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, specifically focusing on when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are involved. It is crucial to understand that a character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions in the premise do not directly validate or provide evidence for the knowledge or reality of another character in the hypothesis. Based on this, determine if the premise necessarily leads to the hypothesis, indicating 'entailment', or if the premise doesn't necessarily lead to the hypothesis, indicating 'non-entailment'. Be sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if the premise is 'Anna believes that Bob knows something' and the hypothesis is 'Bob knows something', the correct answer would be 'non-entailment' because Anna's belief does not automatically validate Bob's knowledge.

   prompt: Examine the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, focusing specifically on cases where beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are involved. It's vital to acknowledge that one character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions about another character's understanding or interpretation of a scenario in the premise doesn't automatically confirm or substantiate those beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions in the hypothesis. This means that if a character suspects or believes in something about another character's belief, assumption, or suspicion, it doesn't automatically lead or entail the same belief, assumption, or suspicion for the primary proposition. Now, identify if the premise unequivocally results in the hypothesis, which would constitute 'entailment', or if the hypothesis can be true independently of the premise, which indicates 'non-entailment'. Please encase your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if the premise is 'Emma suspects that Adam believes something' and the hypothesis is 'Emma believes the same thing', the answer is 'non-entailment' because Emma's suspicion about Adam's belief does not directly validate or translate to her belief. Now, given a premise and hypothesis, assess their relationship and specify whether it signifies 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay close attention to the difference between direct beliefs or suspicions and beliefs or suspicions about others' beliefs or suspicions.

   prompt: Determine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, bearing in mind the concept of 'entailment'. Entailment refers to cases where the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the truth of the premise. Now, pay attention particularly when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions of a character in the narrative are involved. Note that the character's belief, assumption, or suspicion does not directly prove or contribute evidence to the reality of another character in the hypothesis. However, when these notions concern a situation or event, and the same is reflected in the hypothesis, it could imply 'entailment'. Therefore, decide whether the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or doesn't necessarily do so (non-entailment) on a case-by-case basis. When providing your response, choose 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and make sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Chris believes the game is understandable', the correct answer would be 'entailment', as Chris' belief about Jack's understanding implies that Chris also perceives the game as understandable. On the contrary, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Jack understands the game', the correct answer is 'non-entailment', as Chris' belief cannot confirm Jack's understanding.

   prompt: Evaluate the given premises and hypotheses critically. Pay attention to whether the assertion in the premise explicitly confirms the hypothesis, ensuring that beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are not mistaken for direct validation. If the premise indisputably supports the hypothesis, respond with 'entailment'. If the evidence provided in the premise does not directly confirm the hypothesis, respond with 'non-entailment'. The answer should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> tags. Do not overlook the dynamics of indirect or nested statements and how they could impact the connection between the premise and hypothesis. Always verify the context and specifics of the premise - who holds the information, in what context, and whether it is shared or transferred. Ambiguities do not constitute an entailment. Consider the subtleties between direct and indirect assertions, suspicions and confirmations, as well as the elements of recursion that might appear in the statements. A meticulous evaluation of these aspects is required for a correct response.

   prompt: Carefully scrutinize the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, laying emphasis on the core concept or event. Assessment of 'entailment' mandates that the premise wholly supports the hypothesis, either implied or explicit. Also note that belief or suspicion by an individual does not necessarily establish the understanding, knowledge or recognition of the said matter by another individual. Therefore, 'X believes Y understands' does not necessarily imply that 'Y understands' and these must be treated as separate events unless explicit connection is made. Dig into intricate aspects such as linguistic uncertainties and direct or indirect connections between the entities. Always bear in mind that belief, recognition, understanding or knowledge are distinct and their implication may vary with the scenario. The premise may not always directly state its connection to the hypothesis, so implications based on general knowledge or common sense may be valid. When developed ambiguity due to unclear phrases occurs, handle with discretion. Your task is to identify 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on your analysis, framing your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>. Ensure you examine each case on its own merit rather than comparing it to existing templates such as the 'X believes Y understands'. Where doubt exists between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', decide on the basis of whether the hypothesis would still hold true within the scope of the premise, if it was a scenario in reality.

   prompt: Unravel the intricate relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis by focusing on their primary concept or event. Presume that 'X believes Y understands', is equivalent to 'Y understands', unless contradicted by additional context inside the premise. Similarly, when the premise and hypothesis denote the same entity, it is to be treated synonymously, such as 'man' and 'human'. Adjust your comprehension to match contextually similar scenarios in a premise and a hypothesis, like 'dressed only in a towel' and 'not wearing any clothes' at a sauna. Grasp the subtle layers, including direct and indirect relations between the entities, their sources of knowledge, the certainty level, and possible linguistic confusions. Remember, for the case to be 'entailment', the premise must wholly affirm every key element of the hypothesis. If it contradicts or excludes any key hypothesis component, the case is 'non-entailment'. After careful evaluation, decide between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', enclosing your choice in the format <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Start by identifying the core concept or main event in the provided premises and hypotheses. It's important not to overlook the structure and order of the sentences, as these can highly influence the logical relationship between the premises and hypotheses. Pay careful attention to the subtle differences in wording or context that may alter the overall meaning. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, ask yourself: "Is it impossible for the premise to be true if the hypothesis is false?" and "Is it impossible for the hypothesis to be true if the premise is false?" A simple truth consistency between the premise and hypothesis does not constitute entailment. Discern very carefully between what is assumed and what has been confirmed within these statements. Also, it's crucial not to generalize information from the premise to apply it to the hypothesis. After thorough examination, decide if the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Your options are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't forget to consider the broader context in your decision process. Conclude your analysis by providing your chosen answer, enclosing it in <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution with careful consideration of epistemic modalities. Remember to evaluate whether indirect assumption, information attributed to another person's viewpoint or similar elements are present in the premise and hypothesis. Also, recall that entailment is determined not just by shared content, but also the source and pathway of the information. Don't assume that only similarities in object- or person-description result in entailment; it depends on the narrative viewpoint as well.

   prompt: For this task, you are expected to analyze and discern the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, with particular attention paid to causality and whether there is a direct or indirect assumption present. Carefully determine if the assertion or claim is based on first-person knowledge or is attributed to another person's viewpoint or assumption. Bear in mind that shared content between premise and hypothesis does not automatically imply entailment. Additionally, the original source of the information and the means by which it was obtained are equally essential. Entailment is not solely based on similarities in object or person descriptions, but also leans heavily on the consistency of the narrative viewpoint. A person's belief does not necessarily translate into confirmable knowledge for another person, and the transition from belief to knowledge needs to stay consistent with the same viewpoint. So, in this task, based on the premise and hypothesis given, identify if the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Remember to frame your response as an answer option at the end.

   prompt: In this task, your goal is to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Remember that the focus is not on minor or incidental details, but on the broader context and inherent implications of the statements. You need to consider causality, but also keep in mind that any direct or indirect assumptions might present. Exercise careful judgment in identifying if the main assertion arises from first-hand information or is derived from someone else's perspective or supposition. Just because the premise and hypothesis share some content does not immediately point to entailment. Equal importance should be given to the initial source of the information and how it was established. Be aware that entailment not only depends on conspicuous similarities in the description of people or objects. It's also significantly reliant on the coherence of the viewpoint in the narrative, and on whether the removal of certain layers of information still maintains the core content that aligns the premise and the hypothesis. Remember that just because a person believes something, it doesn't mean this belief translates automatically into verifiable knowledge for another individual. The shift from belief to knowledge should maintain consistency with the same viewpoint. Thus, in this assignment, you are asked to identify if the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis equates to 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.’ Please, ensure your response is formatted as one of the given answer options at the end.

   prompt: With your task as evaluating the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, take into account differing degrees of certainty provided by terms such as beliefs, assumptions, understandings and suspicions. It is essential to distinguish when these terms assert factual knowledge, and when they simply reflect speculation or presumption. Identify whether the information contained in the premise definitely implies the conditions stated in the hypothesis or not. Please provide your answer encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, selecting from 'entailment' if the premise confirms the hypothesis and 'non-entailment' if it does not. Keep in mind that plausible inference might not always lead to entailment, particularly when information is passed between individuals or layered with several degrees of speculation like thoughts or beliefs.

   prompt: Evaluate the relationship between the given premise and the hypothesis, specifically focusing on when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are involved. It is crucial to understand that a character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions in the premise do not directly validate or provide evidence for the knowledge or reality of another character in the hypothesis. Based on this, determine if the premise necessarily leads to the hypothesis, indicating 'entailment', or if the premise doesn't necessarily lead to the hypothesis, indicating 'non-entailment'. Be sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if the premise is 'Anna believes that Bob knows something' and the hypothesis is 'Bob knows something', the correct answer would be 'non-entailment' because Anna's belief does not automatically validate Bob's knowledge.

   prompt: Examine the relationship between the given scenario (premise) and the statement (hypothesis) closely. Notice that the notion or suspiciousness of a character towards another character's knowledge in the scenario does not definitively confirm or support the statement. Beliefs, assumptions or suspicions are not proof. Now, if the scenario logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis, then consider that as 'entailment'. If it doesn't, then it's 'non-entailment'. Place your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if the scenario is 'Jane thinks that Chris has a secret' and the statement is 'Chris has a secret', the answer would be 'non-entailment', as Jane's thought doesn't verify Chris's secret. An entailment example would be: Premise: "The cat is on the roof"; Hypothesis: "There is something on the roof". The correct answer is 'entailment'.
Your task is to discern the relation between the provided premise and hypothesis in the context of a character's beliefs, assumptions or suspicions. Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and make sure to frame your answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Determine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, bearing in mind the concept of 'entailment'. Entailment refers to cases where the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the truth of the premise. Now, pay attention particularly when beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions of a character in the narrative are involved. Note that the character's belief, assumption, or suspicion does not directly prove or contribute evidence to the reality of another character in the hypothesis. However, when these notions concern a situation or event, and the same is reflected in the hypothesis, it could imply 'entailment'. Therefore, decide whether the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or doesn't necessarily do so (non-entailment) on a case-by-case basis. When providing your response, choose 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and make sure to enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Chris believes the game is understandable', the correct answer would be 'entailment', as Chris' belief about Jack's understanding implies that Chris also perceives the game as understandable. On the contrary, if the premise states 'Chris believes that Jack understands the game' and the hypothesis is 'Jack understands the game', the correct answer is 'non-entailment', as Chris' belief cannot confirm Jack's understanding.

   prompt: Examine the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, focusing specifically on cases where beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions are involved. It's vital to acknowledge that one character's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions about another character's understanding or interpretation of a scenario in the premise doesn't automatically confirm or substantiate those beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions in the hypothesis. This means that if a character suspects or believes in something about another character's belief, assumption, or suspicion, it doesn't automatically lead or entail the same belief, assumption, or suspicion for the primary proposition. Now, identify if the premise unequivocally results in the hypothesis, which would constitute 'entailment', or if the hypothesis can be true independently of the premise, which indicates 'non-entailment'. Please encase your answer between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if the premise is 'Emma suspects that Adam believes something' and the hypothesis is 'Emma believes the same thing', the answer is 'non-entailment' because Emma's suspicion about Adam's belief does not directly validate or translate to her belief. Now, given a premise and hypothesis, assess their relationship and specify whether it signifies 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay close attention to the difference between direct beliefs or suspicions and beliefs or suspicions about others' beliefs or suspicions.

If the premise indisputably supports the hypothesis, respond with 'entailment'. If the evidence provided in the premise does not directly confirm the hypothesis, respond with 'non-entailment'. The answer should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> tags. Do not overlook the dynamics of indirect or nested statements and how they could impact the connection between the premise and hypothesis. Always verify the context and specifics of the premise - who holds the information, in what context, and whether it is shared or transferred. Ambiguities do not constitute an entailment. Consider the subtleties between direct and indirect assertions, suspicions and confirmations, as well as the elements of recursion that might appear in the statements. A meticulous evaluation of these aspects is required for a correct response.

Look into all aspects such as the direct or indirect connection between the entities mentioned, their avenues of understanding, the level of certainty, and potential linguistic uncertainties. Analyze statements of belief, like 'X believes Y understands', understanding that the belief is a perception layer added onto the event or fact, and its presence or absence does not change the essence of the event or fact. Also, try to discern if 'Y understands' is fundamentally the same as 'X believes Y understands'. Exercise tact when dealing with phrases that could cause ambiguity.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on the central concept or event. The connection could be direct or indirect. The scenario is 'entailment' only when the premise fully supports the hypothesis, both explicitly or implicitly. The premise can suggest aspects of the hypothesis without directly mentioning them. Consider both explicit and implicit connections, especially those suggested by general knowledge or common sense. Reflect not only on the connection between the entities involved but also their perspectives, the degree of certainty, and possible linguistic ambiguities. Evaluate belief statements like 'X believes Y understands', realizing that the belief adds a layer of perception to the event or fact and doesn't change its fundamental nature. Be aware that 'Y understands' and 'X believes Y understands' might hold different implications. Also, consider who holds the belief or assumption as perspectives may differ. Approach any ambiguous phrases with careful scrutiny. After considering all these aspects, make a judgment between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', ensuring that your decision is displayed in the format <answer> and </answer>.

Also note that belief or suspicion by an individual does not necessarily establish the understanding, knowledge or recognition of the said matter by another individual. Therefore, 'X believes Y understands' does not necessarily imply that 'Y understands' and these must be treated as separate events unless explicit connection is made. Dig into intricate aspects such as linguistic uncertainties and direct or indirect connections between the entities. Always bear in mind that belief, recognition, understanding or knowledge are distinct and their implication may vary with the scenario. The premise may not always directly state its connection to the hypothesis, so implications based on general knowledge or common sense may be valid. When developed ambiguity due to unclear phrases occurs, handle with discretion. Your task is to identify 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on your analysis, framing your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>. Ensure you examine each case on its own merit rather than comparing it to existing templates such as the 'X believes Y understands'. Where doubt exists between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', decide on the basis of whether the hypothesis would still hold true within the scope of the premise, if it was a scenario in reality.

   prompt: Examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping a keen focus on the core event or concept. Remember, in order for 'entailment' to occur, the premise must fully support the hypothesis. This support may be present either in explicit or implicit terms. Consider that the premise could suggest parts of the hypothesis even without stating them directly. Pay attention to implicit links that can be inferred based on general knowledge or common sense, as well as the direct or indirect relationships between the mentioned entities, their understandings, the degree of certainty, and potential linguistic ambiguities. Give due recognition to belief-based statements like 'X believes Y' or 'X assumes Y', understanding that these beliefs or assumptions are perceived as facts within the given narrative. Also, analyze and attempt to discern whether 'Y understands' is essentially the same as 'X believes Y understands' or 'X assumes Y'. Look for phrases causing ambiguity and handle them with care. The subject's continuity from the premise to the hypothesis is crucial for 'entailment'. When presented with a premise and hypothesis, consider all these aspects, and then decisively choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', framing your decision in the format <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the logical relationship between the given premises and corresponding hypotheses, directing your attention towards the central event or essential concept. Be aware that 'entailment' requires that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must unconditionally also be true. However, take note of subtle distinctions within the context or wording. Characters' beliefs or suspicions about others' awareness or actions do not necessarily confirm these assumptions. Be cautious not to mistake assumptions or beliefs for confirmations of truth. Your task involves identifying whether or not the premise results in the hypothesis. To achieve this, take the option 'entailment' if the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or otherwise, 'non-entailment'. The terms essentially mean that 'entailment' suggests the hypothesis is unequivocally caused or brought about by the premise, whereas 'non-entailment' suggests it is not. Supply your determined answer within these tags <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Please analyze the relationship between the given premises and their corresponding hypotheses. In your analysis, focus on the key event or main concept, but also pay diligent attention to the context and the particular nuances of language. Remember that the premise does not always entail the hypothesis, particularly if there is a degree of uncertainty embedded within the premise, such as a belief, suspicion, or implication. A premise entails a hypothesis if, and only if, when the premise is true, the hypothesis is also without exception true. Be careful not to confirm hypotheses based on the assumptions made in premises about someone's thoughts or beliefs. Based on your analysis, you are to decide whether or not the premise logically leads to the hypothesis. Your options are 'entailment' if you conclude that the hypothesis would necessarily follow the premise, or 'non-entailment' if it does not. After making a decision, enclose your answer in <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Start by identifying the core concept or main event in the provided premises and hypotheses. It's important not to overlook the structure and order of the sentences, as these can highly influence the logical relationship between the premises and hypotheses. Pay careful attention to the subtle differences in wording or context that may alter the overall meaning. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, ask yourself: "Is it impossible for the premise to be true if the hypothesis is false?" and "Is it impossible for the hypothesis to be true if the premise is false?" A simple truth consistency between the premise and hypothesis does not constitute entailment. Discern very carefully between what is assumed and what has been confirmed within these statements. Also, it's crucial not to generalize information from the premise to apply it to the hypothesis. After thorough examination, decide if the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Your options are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't forget to consider the broader context in your decision process. Conclude your analysis by providing your chosen answer, enclosing it in <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: For this task, you are expected to analyze and discern the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, with particular attention paid to causality and whether there is a direct or indirect assumption present. Carefully determine if the assertion or claim is based on first-person knowledge or is attributed to another person's viewpoint or assumption. Bear in mind that shared content between premise and hypothesis does not automatically imply entailment. Additionally, the original source of the information and the means by which it was obtained are equally essential. Entailment is not solely based on similarities in object or person descriptions, but also leans heavily on the consistency of the narrative viewpoint. A person's belief does not necessarily translate into confirmable knowledge for another person, and the transition from belief to knowledge needs to stay consistent with the same viewpoint. So, in this task, based on the premise and hypothesis given, identify if the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Remember to frame your response as an answer option at the end.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, focusing keenly on epistemic modalities. Evaluate whether indirect assumption, information attributed to another's perspective, or similar elements are present in the premise and hypothesis. Remember, entailment is determined not only by shared content but also by the direct source of the information. In cases where information is directly attributed from one person to another, without ambiguity, the truth of the attributed belief or assumption persists despite the 'pathway'. Be attentive to slight changes or generalizations in descriptions of objects or people; variances, such as the shift from specific to generic, shouldn't necessarily result in non-entailment. Finally, keep in mind that entailment is directly impacted by the narrative truth, in other words, what the narrative presents as fact, irrespective of whose viewpoint it emerges from. So, consider the inherent truth of a statement within a narrative, whether reported by a primary or secondary character.

   prompt: Analyzing and answering questions related to causal attribution needs careful thought. Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis is inferred, or 'entailed', from the premise or not. You'll have to consider statements of indirect assumptions or viewpoints attributed to other individuals present in both the premise and the hypothesis. Remember, determining entailment isn't just about shared content. The source of the information and how it's communicated, its pathway, also matter. Don't base your judgement only on the similarities or differences in descriptions of objects or individuals. How the story is told, the narrative viewpoint, can alter the entailment. It's not about the truth of the assumed thought or viewpoint—it's about whether the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, in the light of all the information and attribution pathways. Now, identify the relationship between premise and hypothesis from the options: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide your answer by bracketing your option between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: In this task, your goal is to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Remember that the focus is not on minor or incidental details, but on the broader context and inherent implications of the statements. You need to consider causality, but also keep in mind that any direct or indirect assumptions might present. Exercise careful judgment in identifying if the main assertion arises from first-hand information or is derived from someone else's perspective or supposition. Just because the premise and hypothesis share some content does not immediately point to entailment. Equal importance should be given to the initial source of the information and how it was established. Be aware that entailment not only depends on conspicuous similarities in the description of people or objects. It's also significantly reliant on the coherence of the viewpoint in the narrative, and on whether the removal of certain layers of information still maintains the core content that aligns the premise and the hypothesis. Remember that just because a person believes something, it doesn't mean this belief translates automatically into verifiable knowledge for another individual. The shift from belief to knowledge should maintain consistency with the same viewpoint. Thus, in this assignment, you are asked to identify if the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis equates to 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.’ Please, ensure your response is formatted as one of the given answer options at the end.

   prompt: In this task, you are charged with the critical analysis of a premise and a hypothesis to decipher their relationship. Determine if these bear an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship. Appraise causality with a fine eye for detailing, and keenly discern if a direct or indirect assumption is insinuated. Further, evaluate whether the assertion is rooted in firsthand information or is an attribution from another individual's perspective or assumption. A significant point to be mindful of is that similar content between a premise and hypothesis does not mandatorily suggest entailment. The original source of the information and the process adopted for its acquisition merit equal importance. Remember, entailment isn't solely pivoted on the similarities in object or person descriptions, but is greatly influenced by a consistent narrative viewpoint. Do not be swayed to assume that an individual's belief invariably converts into confirmable knowledge for another. This transition needs to be viewpoint-consistent. So, establish with precision based on the given premise and hypothesis if the relation is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Whether a belief or understanding remains consistent within a single person's viewpoint in both premise and hypothesis should establish entailment. Exercise care while judging entailment based on second-hand assumptions or indirect knowledge. Pay close attention to the logic and understanding across perspectives. Additionally, it is crucial to differentiate between direct and indirect assertions in ascertaining entailment or non-entailment. Frame your final response as an answer choice at the end and enclose it between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: In this exercise, you need to inspect the connection between a premise and a hypothesis. Focus on the events or facts detailed in the premise and consider if they logically suggest or result in the events or assertions of the hypothesis. Keep in mind that having shared content or similar descriptions doesn't automatically affirm entailment. Remember that entailment heavily relies on the logical progression from the premise to the hypothesis. While considering entailment, it's critical to check if the hypothesis seems to be a subset or a broad-based representation of the premise. The transition from the scenario described in the premise to the assertion made in the hypothesis should be logically consistent. So, your task is to discern and state whether the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' Ensure to present your response as an answer option at the end.
