SVG path commands like \"M\" for moveto, \"L\" for lineto, and \"A\" for elliptical Arc can form intricate closed shapes. Consider the \"M\" and \"L\" commands as they create links between numerous coordinates, forming shapes, not just lines. Pay significant attention when the same start and endpoint is shared by several consecutive \"A\" commands as it typically symbolizes a circle, regardless of the arc parameters' variability. Keep in mind that multiple connected \"L\" commands might trace polygons of various sides, where the number and sequence of coordinates can depict different shapes, not just the count of the commands themselves. Geometric shapes display unique traits like number of sides, symmetry, and angles which could be crucial for the identification, so familiarize yourself with these characteristics.

It's fundamental to understand that even a partial arc contributes to the contour of the overall shape.\n\nTo identify polygonal shapes, consider the number of sides the shape has. This can be determined by counting the number of edges formed by sequential 'L' and 'M' commands.
