For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it should make the hypothesis absolutely and unavoidably true, considering all specifics and details. An 'entailment' situation excludes both assumptions and probabilistic outcomes. Please take note that the presence of suggestive terms like \"believes\", \"suspects\", or \"learns\" in the premise does not make the hypothesis automatically true. Furthermore, never consider one person's belief or suspicion to substantiate the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any type of correlation or similarity, but about thoroughly discerning when every detail in the hypothesis is undeniably supported by the premise. Indicate your answer by inserting your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For cases where the premise and the hypothesis don't make an exact match in the truthfulness of all details ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Similarly, if the premise claims 'Sarah believes that John knows a secret', it is a non-entailment situation, since Sarah's belief doesn't indisputably confirm that John indeed knows a secret. Carefully remember, beliefs or suspicions of one person do not constitute undeniable confirmations of another person's knowledge or actions. Look at the premise and the hypothesis critically, evaluate each detail, and base your decision on the premise\u2019s ability to absolutely validate the hypothesis without leaving room for doubt or assumption.",

Use the concept of 'entailment' strictly when the hypothesis is unequivocally true if the premise is true. Acknowledge this: terms like \"believes\", \"suspects\", or \"learns\" in a premise do not substantiate the hypothesis. Understandings or beliefs of different individuals are independent of each other; a premise about one person's understanding or belief doesn't confirm another's understanding or belief, irrespective of the seeming similarity in their content. Your task doesn't aim to identify correlations; it\u2019s to meticulously determine when a premise indisputably establishes the truth of a hypothesis. Strive for precision in your answer by enclosing your choice between <answer> and </answer>. For scenarios where the premise and hypothesis don't assure each other\u2019s validity ('non-entailment'), mark it as (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, rendering it as <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. For instance, if the premise is 'Taylor understands that a cyclist is biking across a garage', and the hypothesis is 'Richard understands there is a cycling event', it\u2019s non-entailment, as Taylor's understanding doesn't guarantee Richard's hypothesis. Always remember, avoid generalizing or creating inferences based on the commonalities in the premise and hypothesis. To ensure entailment, the specifics in the hypothesis must exactly align with the premise, without room for interpretation or ambiguity.",

            "prompt": "Your task is to analyze and classify the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it should make the hypothesis absolutely and unavoidably true, considering all specifics and details. An 'entailment' situation excludes both assumptions and probabilistic outcomes. Please take note that the presence of suggestive terms like \"believes\", \"suspects\", or \"learns\" in the premise does not make the hypothesis automatically true. Furthermore, never consider one person's belief or suspicion to substantiate the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any type of correlation or similarity, but about thoroughly discerning when every detail in the hypothesis is undeniably supported by the premise. Indicate your answer by inserting your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For cases where the premise and the hypothesis don't make an exact match in the truthfulness of all details ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Similarly, if the premise claims 'Sarah believes that John knows a secret', it is a non-entailment situation, since Sarah's belief doesn't indisputably confirm that John indeed knows a secret. Carefully remember, beliefs or suspicions of one person do not constitute undeniable confirmations of another person's knowledge or actions. Look at the premise and the hypothesis critically, evaluate each detail, and base your decision on the premise\u2019s ability to absolutely validate the hypothesis without leaving room for doubt or assumption.",

            "prompt": "Your task is to analyze the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: are they in 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')? Use the notion of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis is unavoidably true if the premise is true. Take heed that a premise which includes suggestive terms like \"believes\", \"suspects\", or \"learns\" doesn't automatically make the hypothesis true. Similarly, never assume that the belief or suspicion of one person validates the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any kind of correlation, but about thoroughly discerning when the premise makes the hypothesis absolutely true. Specify your answer by including your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For instances where the premise and the hypothesis don't directly equate to each other's truthfulness ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. To elaborate, if the premise states 'Person X suspects that person Y learns something', it is non-entailment, because Person X's suspicion doesn't confirm that Person Y has learnt something. Keep in mind, suspicions or beliefs of one person are not factual confirmations of another's knowledge or actions.",
