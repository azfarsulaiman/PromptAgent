I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is <B>non-entailment</B>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:
One main reason the model may have guessed the wrong answer is due to the complexities of the concept of 'entailment.' 'Entailment' in logic means that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, which is a little different from the concept of 'cause and effect' the prompt asks about. In this scenario, the prompt might have confused the model to link two concepts that are similar but different. The model is led to recognize that Joseph's suspicion doesn't directly cause Isabella's learning incident, hence its incorrect answer is 'entailment.'

For Example 2:
Again, the concept of 'entailment' creates confusion and leads the model astray. The model may interpret the premise and hypothesis as not being necessarily connected based on its understanding of 'causal attribution,' hence incorrectly identifying the relation as 'non-entailment.' However, in the context presented, Robert's memory does not alter the action of Richard's assumption, technically making this an entailment scenario.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Make the prompt more specific - Instead of 'Answer questions about causal attribution,' the prompt could be 'Identify if a premise entails a hypothesis in the examples, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.'
2. Add additional context - The prompt should include a brief explanation of what entailment means in the context of the task, to prevent the model from getting confused between 'causal attribution' and 'entailment.'
3. Focus on vocabulary - As 'entailment' is a formal term in logic, the prompt can be more effective if it uses simpler, layperson terminology that reduces complexity and possible misunderstanding.
4. Separate tasks - Since the current task actually involves two different tasks i.e. identifying entailment and then formatting the answer correctly. Separating these two tasks into different prompts could be helpful for the model to better complete each task.

Examples wrong analysis:

<1> 
The question asked the model to identify the relation between two premises and choose the right option between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Though the prompt does talk about "causal attribution", it does not clarify the context for entailment and non-entailment, which requires the model to judge if the assertion can necessarily be inferred from the preceding statement. In this case, the premise and hypothesis are not in a definite relation of entailment since Joseph's suspicions are irrelevant to what Isabella learns, yet the model incorrectly identified as entailment, providing the wrong answer.

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1. The task specified in the prompt, "Answer questions about causal attribution," is not directly related to checking the entailment or non-entailment of the statements, which led to wrong predictions.
2. The prompt doesn't provide explicit instructions or context about entailment and non-entailment, leaving the model to interpret and possibly misinterpret the task.
3. The model was unable to discern that the condition "Joseph suspects" does not automatically translate to the fact that "Isabella learns", leading to a mistaken causal relationship.

Improvements for the prompt:
Based on the above analysis, it's clear that the prompt requires some improvements. Here are some ways that it could be improved:

1. Specify the task more clearly: The prompt should describe the task related to entailment and non-entailment recognition, such as "identify the type of relationship between these statements."
2. Define entailment and non-entailment: The prompt should clarify or provide some context for entailment and non-entailment. This could help the model to better understand the task and make accurate predictions.
3. Add clearer instructions about answering: It might help to specify certain conditions about when to choose one or the other option. For instance, highlighting that entailment occurs only when the hypothesis is necessarily true if the premise is true.
4. Include a note on causation: Specifically mention in the prompt that the model should carefully consider if a causal relationship applies between the premises and hypotheses, reinforcing the ideals of causal attribution.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Reason: The example question is testing the langauge model's understanding about 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', however, this type of question is not about 'causal attribution' that the prompt specifies. Having the model to answer questions about 'causal attribution' may confuse the model to predict the 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' correctly. 

Wrong Example 2:

Reason: Similarly, the example question is about 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and not about 'causal attribution'. The model in its current state, based on the specified prompt, is not trained or oriented to correctly implement the logic of how an hypothesis is entailed from the premise or not. Due to this reason, it fails to provide the correct answer.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. Specify the Prompt: The prompt is generic about 'causal attribution' but the example questions are specific about 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. A more specific prompt can steer the language model in the right direction such as 'Answer questions about entailment and non-entailment relations based on the given premises and hypotheses'.
 
2. Provide More Context: Certain key points related to detection of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could be included in the prompt. For instance, emphasizing the fact that an hypothesis is entailed if it is a direct observation or assumption stated in the premise.

3. Include Examples: The prompt could include examples of correctly identified 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' situations, helping the model to better understand the task.

4. Set Answer Format: The directive to express the answer in a specific format can be separated from the task prompt to avoid any confusion. It can be communicated after the task-specific prompt so that the model is aware of the structure of the response.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

1. The prompt asks the model to determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis. The premise mentions "Ava believes" that something is happening while the hypothesis states that event. Here the model seems to have mistaken a belief with an implication. 
2. The model likely selected 'entailment' because Ava's belief (premise) includes the event of Emma suspecting (hypothesis). However, Ava's belief does not necessarily mean that Emma does suspect something. Ava's belief is subjective and may not represent the reality.
3. The correct answer, 'non-entailment', is thus due to the subjective nature of Ava's belief which may not necessarily entail the hypothesis. 

Wrong Example 2:

1. Similar to the first example, the premise includes "Joseph suspects" but the hypothesis fails to incorporate this. The model confuses the personal suspicion (premise) with the actual event (hypothesis).
2. The model predicts 'entailment' which is wrong because someone's suspicion does not essentially mean that the actual event is happening.
3. Again, the right answer should be 'non-entailment' as personal suspicion does not automatically lead to implication. 

Ways to Improve the Prompt: 

1. The prompt could include clarification about the nature of subjectivity. The prompt might explain that personal beliefs and suspicions should not be over-generalized as the reality.
2. The prompt could emphasize the meaning of 'necessity' more clearly, to stress that 'entailment' applies only when the premise definitively results in the hypothesis.
3. Additionally, the prompt could provide examples to clarify for the model what entailment does or does not look like, to better teach the model these nuances.

Determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis given, selecting 'entailment' if the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true, and 'non-entailment' otherwise. After identifying, place the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis given, selecting 'entailment' if the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true, and 'non-entailment' otherwise. After identifying, place the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis given, selecting 'entailment' if the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true, and 'non-entailment' otherwise. After identifying, place the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

1. The prompt asks the model to determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis. The premise mentions "Ava believes" that something is happening while the hypothesis states that event. Here the model seems to have mistaken a belief with an implication. 
2. The model likely selected 'entailment' because Ava's belief (premise) includes the event of Emma suspecting (hypothesis). However, Ava's belief does not necessarily mean that Emma does suspect something. Ava's belief is subjective and may not represent the reality.
3. The correct answer, 'non-entailment', is thus due to the subjective nature of Ava's belief which may not necessarily entail the hypothesis. 

Wrong Example 2:

1. Similar to the first example, the premise includes "Joseph suspects" but the hypothesis fails to incorporate this. The model confuses the personal suspicion (premise) with the actual event (hypothesis).
2. The model predicts 'entailment' which is wrong because someone's suspicion does not essentially mean that the actual event is happening.
3. Again, the right answer should be 'non-entailment' as personal suspicion does not automatically lead to implication. 

Ways to Improve the Prompt: 

1. The prompt could include clarification about the nature of subjectivity. The prompt might explain that personal beliefs and suspicions should not be over-generalized as the reality.
2. The prompt could emphasize the meaning of 'necessity' more clearly, to stress that 'entailment' applies only when the premise definitively results in the hypothesis.
3. Additionally, the prompt could provide examples to clarify for the model what entailment does or does not look like, to better teach the model these nuances.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis given, selecting 'entailment' if the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true, and 'non-entailment' otherwise. After identifying, place the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

gradient:
<1>
Wrong Example Analysis:
The model chose ‘entailment’ rather than ‘non-entailment’ incorrectly. The premise states that "Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping." However, the hypothesis is "Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping." Here, there is a difference between what Ava believes and the actual fact. The premise doesn’t guarantee that Emma has the suspicion, just that Ava believes Emma does. 

Reason For Misinterpretation:
The model might be wrongly interpreting the belief of a person as a fact. The information that "Ava believes" should not influence the actual situation of "Emma suspects."

<2>
Wrong Example Analysis:
The model chose ‘entailment’ rather than ‘non-entailment’ incorrectly. The premise states that "Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium." The hypothesis is "Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium." Just because Joseph suspects something, it doesn't mean it's necessarily true. Suspicions and facts are different.

Reason For Misinterpretation:
The model may be wrongly conflating suspicions and facts. Joseph's suspicion doesn't necessarily imply that the hypothesis is factually true. 

<3>
Wrong Example Analysis:
In this instance, the model predicted correctly. However, the given correct label is wrong, leading to perceived incorrectness. The premise states that "Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people." The hypothesis is "Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle." Taylor's understanding doesn't necessarily mean that Richard understands the same thing, hence, the correct response should be 'non-entailment'.

Reason For Misinterpretation:
It might not be a case of misinterpretation by the model but a mistake in the provided correct answer.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Be clearer about understanding that beliefs, suspicions and understandings of individuals don't necessarily reflect reality.
2. Specify that the model should judge the premise and the hypothesis independently, that the actions or thoughts of one individual don't necessarily equate to the actions or thoughts of another. 
3. Emphasize the difference between someone's personal belief or suspicion and the absolute fact.
4. Make sure the correct labels provided for the training are accurate. Inconsistent or wrong training labels will affect the model's learning and performance.

For each wrong example:

<1>
- Question: Does the premise "Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping" necessarily imply the hypothesis "Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping"?
- Wrong Answer: (A) entailment
- Reasoning: The statement that Ava believes that Emma suspects something does not necessarily directly imply that Emma does in fact hold that suspicion. Ava's belief could be misguided, incorrect, or based on false information, meaning that there may not be a direct entailment from the premise to the hypothesis.

<2>
- Question: Does the premise "Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium" necessarily imply the hypothesis "Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium"?
- Wrong Answer: (A) entailment
- Reasoning: Again, this question suffers from a similar problem as the first one. Joseph's suspicion does not necessarily confirm that Isabella has learnt something. This means that there is not a direct entailment from the premise to the hypothesis.

From the above reasoning:

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Clearly define entailment: The model seems to be having trouble understanding that "person A believing person B thinks something" does not entail "person B actually thinks that thing." The prompt could better define entailment as not extending to personal beliefs or suspicions, but rather to concrete, indisputable facts.
2. Explicitly mention the subjectivity of beliefs/suspicions: The prompt could explicitly state to consider the subjectivity and potential inaccuracies of personal beliefs and suspicions when determining entailment. This may prevent the model from assuming an automatic entailment in these cases.
3. Add more examples or clear definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment': Inclusion of precise, clear examples depicting a variety of situations, including ones with beliefs or suspicions, can help the model better understand the application of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The examples given should therefore cover a wider range of scenarios.
4. Explicit guidance to assess each premise independently: The model should be explicitly guided to not infer additional information which is not stated in the premise.
5. Provide a clear distinction between ‘belief/suspicions’ and ‘facts’: The model seems to be mixing up a third person’s belief or suspicion with the actual fact. This distinction should be clearly provided in the instruction.

In one or more sentences, assess whether the given premise strictly leads to the hypothesis. Select 'entailment' if the hypothesis must unavoidably be true given the premise, focusing on concrete, undeniable facts. Select 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis does not have to be true based on the premise. Bear in mind that an individual's belief or suspicion does not inherently equate to truth or fact.

Wrong example examination:

Example 1:

Question: The premise states 'Taylor' understands a person in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. The hypothesis is 'Richard' knows there is a man riding a bicycle. 

Answer: The model wrongly predicted, 'entailment' because it made an assumption that the comprehension of Taylor and Richard are the same.

Reason: The premise mentions 'Taylor' while the hypothesis mentions 'Richard.' There's no connection established between their awareness levels, hence the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. 

The prompt may have led to this error due to the following reasons:
1. Lack of clarification: The prompt does not clearly distinguish between different subjects (here,Taylor and Richard) in the premise and hypothesis.
2. Absence of emphasis on individual comprehension: The prompt does not emphasize that the understanding of information may be subjective and could vary between individuals.
3. Misinterpretation of objective details: The prompt could have been clearer in directing the model to gauge the relationship between objective details of the premise and hypothesis, rather than making assumptions.

Based on these insights, the following amendments can improve the prompt:

1. Introduce a specification that calls for considering varying comprehension of different subjects in the premise and hypothesis.
2. Incorporate a guideline for the model to attentively evaluate the objective elements mentioned in both the premise and hypothesis.
3. Emphasize on the individuality of perception where two different people viewing the same event might not necessarily have the same understanding.
4. Add a cautionary instruction against making assumptions or deducing information that is not explicitly mentioned in the premise or hypothesis.

gradient:
<1> 
Example Analysis: 
The model's input clearly states to select 'non-entailment' when the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The premise here remains subjective since it's based on 'Taylor's understanding'. However, the hypothesis is about 'Richard's understanding', which are totally unrelated contexts. The model seems to be slightly misled by the overlapping content within the premise and hypothesis, without considering whose perspective this content is from.

Reason for Incorrect Answer: In this case, the model may not have grasped this distinction between contexts and perspectives, which are vital in determining whether the premise necessarily entails the hypothesis. This could be due to the prompt not explicitly requiring the model to consider the source or subjectivity of the information.

<2> 
Example Analysis: The model selected 'non-entailment' despite the premise and hypothesis containing identical details about Richard's assumption. It's possible that the model was thrown off by the mention of 'Robert's memory', although this does not change the content of the assumption provided.

Reason for Incorrect Answer: The model might have centered more on the subjectivity element within the premise rather than focusing on the exact relational substance between premise and hypothesis. It’s likely that the model interpreted 'Robert's memory' as a subjective source of information, leading to a wrong answer.


To Improve the Prompt:

1. Emphasize the importance of comparing the exact details between premise and hypothesis, while disregarding extraneous information. This could help the model focus on the content within these sentences, not their sources.

2. Explicitly instruct the model to consider the contexts and perspectives within each scenario. It will reduce the chances of it missing out on important relational characteristics.

3. The instruction to the model could clarify that the entailment relation should hold 'absolutely and strictly'. This could reduce the model's overinterpretation of the subjective elements in the sentences.

Improved Prompt:
Analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis strictly as per their factual content, without considering any possible speculation or source of these facts, such as the memory or understanding of certain characters involved. Choose 'entailment' only when the premise, with absolute and strict certainty, makes the provided hypothesis true, meaning that every single detail in the hypothesis should be covered in the premise. Select 'non-entailment' if the premise does not strictly guarantee the complete truth of the hypothesis. After identifying the correct option, enclose the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Here, the model assumes that because a cyclist is mentioned in the premise, it directly relates to the hypothesis stating that there is a man riding a bicycle. However, it overlooks the fact that the premise is about Taylor's understanding, while the hypothesis involves Richard's understanding. While both situations theoretically could occur in the same context, the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. 

<2>
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

In this question, the model may be confused by the difference in perception ('Robert remembers' vs 'Richard assumes'). However, the core assertion (a man checking his facial hair) in both the premise and the hypothesis are identical. Because Richard's assumption remains unchanged in both contexts, this leads to entailment. 

Potential improvements for the prompt could involve:

- Elaborating on the concept of 'entailment' as the absolute certainty of the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. 
- Defining more clearly what could constitute 'non-entailment', especially dealing with subjective elements like beliefs, suspicions, or different perspectives. 
- Encouraging the model to consider personal perspectives, assumptions, and how these elements might change the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.
- Advising the model to evaluate each component of the premise and hypothesis, not just overarching themes. For example, consider the individuals involved, the actions they are performing, and the problem context.
- Adding more examples to train the model to better understand these nuances.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Here, the model assumes that because a cyclist is mentioned in the premise, it directly relates to the hypothesis stating that there is a man riding a bicycle. However, it overlooks the fact that the premise is about Taylor's understanding, while the hypothesis involves Richard's understanding. While both situations theoretically could occur in the same context, the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. 

<2>
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

In this question, the model may be confused by the difference in perception ('Robert remembers' vs 'Richard assumes'). However, the core assertion (a man checking his facial hair) in both the premise and the hypothesis are identical. Because Richard's assumption remains unchanged in both contexts, this leads to entailment. 

Potential improvements for the prompt could involve:

- Elaborating on the concept of 'entailment' as the absolute certainty of the truth of the hypothesis based on the premise. 
- Defining more clearly what could constitute 'non-entailment', especially dealing with subjective elements like beliefs, suspicions, or different perspectives. 
- Encouraging the model to consider personal perspectives, assumptions, and how these elements might change the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.
- Advising the model to evaluate each component of the premise and hypothesis, not just overarching themes. For example, consider the individuals involved, the actions they are performing, and the problem context.
- Adding more examples to train the model to better understand these nuances.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Determine if the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis given, selecting 'entailment' if the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true, and 'non-entailment' otherwise. After identifying, place the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(2) Carefully analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis provided. Select 'entailment' when the premise, with absolute certainty, results in the provided hypothesis being true. Choose 'non-entailment' in situations where the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, such as when it contains subjective elements like beliefs or suspicions which may not tally with the reality. After identifying the correct option, enclose the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. The hypothesis, on the other hand, mentions Richard understanding that there is a man riding a bicycle. These are two different individuals (Taylor and Richard) and the descriptions of the events they understand are not directly connected. Therefore, there is no clear logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

Incorrect Example Analysis:

The model incorrectly identifies the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as an 'entailment'. This could be due to several issues:

1. The model may be failing to recognize the difference in the subjects mentioned in the premise and the hypothesis. This difference should be an immediate signal that the premise does not absolutely guarantee the truthfulness of the hypothesis.

2. The perspective switch from Taylor and Richard is not addressed directly in the prompt, so perhaps the model is not fully regarding this change of point of view as an indicator of non-entailment.

3. The prompt might be too long and complex, causing confusion and resulting in an incorrect answer. 

4. The prompt does not instruct the model specifically to consider whether the events that two individuals understand are directly connected. Given this gap in the instructions, the model might be assuming that the connection between the two events is irrelevant to determining entailment.

Prompt Improvement:

To improve the prompt and avoid similar errors we could:

1. Directly address the issue of subject difference, instructing the model to pay close attention to whether the subjects of the premise and hypothesis are the same or different.

2. Include specific instructions about how to handle the analysis when the perspective changes between the premise and hypothesis. 

3. Simplify the prompt with clearer, more concise instructions to avoid potential confusion and help guide the model's analysis more effectively.

4. Specify in the instructions that the direct relationship between the events in the premise and hypothesis is crucial, especially when the subjects are different.

New Proposed Prompt:

"In this task, your goal is to analyze the relationship between a given premise and a hypothesis. Choose 'entailment' if the premise conclusively confirms the truth of the hypothesis, taking into consideration the subjects or individuals involved and their particular understanding or perspective. Choose 'non-entailment' if the premise does not ensure the validity of the hypothesis due to different subjects, perspectives, or no direct connection between the events described. Do not make assumptions or inferences not explicitly included in the material. Present your choice 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' within <answer> and </answer> tags."

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.

Model's Wrong Answer: <answer>Non-entailment</answer>

Reasons for the Wrong Answer: 

1. Incorrect Classification: The language model seems to have been conflicted with the different subjects or individuals mentioned in the premise and hypothesis - Taylor and Richard. While the actions described about the individual ('a cyclist') are the same, the understanding of the same event by different individuals (Taylor and Richard) seems to have led the model to select 'non-entailment.'

2. Lack of Specificity: The model might have focused on the fact that the premise specifically points out that the cyclist is in a red and white uniform and is biking across a garage full of people. However, the hypothesis is about Richard's general understanding of a man riding a bicycle - this could be any bicycle, in any location, wearing any clothes. The prompt does not sufficiently explain how to deal with this kind of specificity in the premise and generic nature in the hypothesis.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify Context: Clarify in the prompt how to handle scenarios where different individuals perceive the same events differently.

2. Specificity Versus Generalization: Provide a guideline to the model about how to deal with scenarios where the premise has specific descriptions and the hypothesis has a generalized view.

3. Reinforce Understanding: Enhance the explanation around how 'entailment' should be chosen only when the premise defines with absolute certainty the truthfulness of the hypothesis. This might help the model not to conclude a certain option solely based on presumption. 

4. Introduce the Principle of Charity: In language understanding tasks, it could be essential to command the system to apply the principle of charity, considering the most reasonable interpretation of the sentences while being charitable to possible discrepancies coming from a lack of context or specificity.

5. Refinement of Instructions: The command "Avoid making assumptions" could be too strict for this task. Usually, language understanding involves a degree of inference and assumption because not all details are spelled out in every statement. It might be more appropriate to instruct the model to limit unnecessary assumptions but also accommodate natural language understanding inferences within reason.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, making sure to distinguish between the different subjects or individuals mentioned. 'Entailment' is the correct choice if the premise defines with absolute certainty, without relying on inferences or assumptions, the truthfulness of the hypothesis. 'Non-entailment' is to be chosen when the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, or when it is based on personal conceptions such as beliefs or suspicions, or even when two individuals may interpret the same event differently. 

Avoid making assumptions and focus on the objective elements in the premise and hypothesis. Reject any temptation to infer connections not clearly stated in the material provided. Once the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is established, present the selected option 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>Non-entailment</answer>

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.

Model's Wrong Answer: <answer>Non-entailment</answer>

Reasons for the Wrong Answer: 

1. Incorrect Classification: The language model seems to have been conflicted with the different subjects or individuals mentioned in the premise and hypothesis - Taylor and Richard. While the actions described about the individual ('a cyclist') are the same, the understanding of the same event by different individuals (Taylor and Richard) seems to have led the model to select 'non-entailment.'

2. Lack of Specificity: The model might have focused on the fact that the premise specifically points out that the cyclist is in a red and white uniform and is biking across a garage full of people. However, the hypothesis is about Richard's general understanding of a man riding a bicycle - this could be any bicycle, in any location, wearing any clothes. The prompt does not sufficiently explain how to deal with this kind of specificity in the premise and generic nature in the hypothesis.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify Context: Clarify in the prompt how to handle scenarios where different individuals perceive the same events differently.

2. Specificity Versus Generalization: Provide a guideline to the model about how to deal with scenarios where the premise has specific descriptions and the hypothesis has a generalized view.

3. Reinforce Understanding: Enhance the explanation around how 'entailment' should be chosen only when the premise defines with absolute certainty the truthfulness of the hypothesis. This might help the model not to conclude a certain option solely based on presumption. 

4. Introduce the Principle of Charity: In language understanding tasks, it could be essential to command the system to apply the principle of charity, considering the most reasonable interpretation of the sentences while being charitable to possible discrepancies coming from a lack of context or specificity.

5. Refinement of Instructions: The command "Avoid making assumptions" could be too strict for this task. Usually, language understanding involves a degree of inference and assumption because not all details are spelled out in every statement. It might be more appropriate to instruct the model to limit unnecessary assumptions but also accommodate natural language understanding inferences within reason.

(2) Carefully analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis provided. Select 'entailment' when the premise, with absolute certainty, results in the provided hypothesis being true. Choose 'non-entailment' in situations where the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, such as when it contains subjective elements like beliefs or suspicions which may not tally with the reality. After identifying the correct option, enclose the answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in a detailed manner, taking into consideration the difference in subjects or people mentioned. 'Entailment' should be chosen when there is absolute certainty that the premise results in the hypothesis being true, without consideration of any unfounded assumptions or inferences. 'Non-entailment' should be selected when the premise does not ensure the truth of the hypothesis. This includes situations based on personal understandings such as beliefs or suspicions, or when multiple people might interpret the same event in different ways. 

Dealing with specific and generalized representations, consider specifics in the hypothesis as applicable to the more general premise, unless contradictory. When subjects or individuals involved perceive the same events differently, interpret the sentences from each point of view and use the principle of charity to determine the best fit. 

Do not merely focus on making no assumptions. Instead, limit unnecessary hypotheses but enable reasonable assumptions that cater to natural language understanding to deduce a possible connection, only if these connections are reasonable and not clearly contradicted by the text. 

After deciding the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, select the fitting option – 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' - and encase it within <answer> and </answer> tags. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment. Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium does not definitively prove that Isabella actually learns that a woman is standing at a podium. There is a possibility that Joseph's suspicion is incorrect or that Isabella's understanding differs from what Joseph suspects. Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the answer is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons for the Error:

1. Interpretation of 'suspicion': The model seems to consider the verb 'suspects' in the premise as definitive and takes it as a fact, which is incorrect. The premise only states Joseph's suspicion, which does not establish an objective fact. This misunderstanding may have led the model to assume Joseph's suspicion as fact resulting in the erroneous interpretation that Isabella indeed learns that a woman is standing at a podium.

2. Absence of direct entailment analysis: It appears that the model does not clearly outline how 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' is derived from the premise-hypothesis examination. Although the response mentions that the premise does not definitively prove the hypothesis, it does not clearly explain the lack of an entailment relationship as per the instructions in the prompt.

3. Misalignment in example and response: The model's written response contradicts its prediction which shows a disconnect in the reasoning process.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Highlight the meaning of 'entailment': Emphasize in the prompt that entailment means the hypothesis is an undeniable conclusion from the premise.

2. Explain included terms: Make sure to better outline the terms 'belief', 'suspicion', and 'interpreting the same event differently'. The prompt might need to insist on understanding these terms not as facts, but as points of view that cannot affirm the truthfulness of the hypothesis.

3. Encourage careful analysis: Raise awareness to not skip important words that introduce uncertainty to the premise, such as 'suspects'. 

4. Accuracy of answer tagging: Insist on ensuring that the answer selected aligns with the reasoning provided and is correctly tagged in <answer> fields. 

5. Include more examples: Offer more examples, especially those involving beliefs or suspicions, for a clearer understanding of what constitutes 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

Summarily, the prompt could be clearer in its definition of entailment, specify the meaning of key terms, encourage thorough analysis of the premise and hypothesis, and provide more examples to disallow ambiguous interpretations.

<START> Your task is to analyze the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis. Choose 'entailment' if the premise with absolute certainty and without making inferences or assumptions, leads to the truthfulness of the hypothesis. Select 'non-entailment' when the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, particularly when it involves subjective experiences such as beliefs or suspicions, which cannot definitively establish the truth of the hypothesis.

Be cautious of words that introduce uncertainty to the premise like 'suspects', and ensure not to view them as solid evidence. Avoid making assumptions beyond what is objectively stated in the premise and hypothesis, and refrain from inferring connections not explicitly stated in the material provided.

Understand, the words 'belief' and 'suspicion' denote an individual's opinion or point of view, not an established fact. Keep in mind that two individuals may perceive the same event differently, so their respective assertions cannot be taken as a universally accepted truth.

Once the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is discerned, wrap the selected option, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', within <answer> and </answer> tags. Please ensure that your selected answer is in full agreement with your reasoning.

For illustration:

Premise: James believes that kids love the new toy craze.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Assess the correlation between the given premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is a definite consequence of the premise, select 'entailment'. If the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, select 'non-entailment'. Take into account that individual beliefs, suspicions, or understandings are subjective and may not reflect the absolute reality, and that one person's understanding does not necessarily equate to another's understanding. Place your answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Assess the correlation between the given premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is a definite consequence of the premise, select 'entailment'. If the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, select 'non-entailment'. Take into account that individual beliefs, suspicions, or understandings are subjective and may not reflect the absolute reality, and that one person's understanding does not necessarily equate to another's understanding.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.

The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1, the model predicted 'entailment' despite the possibility of non-entailment. The model is most likely associating the mention of Emma in the premise with the mention of Emma in the hypothesis and is treating these as related facts. However, the prompt specifically instructs the model to ignore individual beliefs, suspicions, or understandings. Thus, even though Ava believes that Emma suspects something true, it isn't necessarily the case that Emma actually suspects it. This leads to the wrong answer.

For Example 2, similar to the first example, the model drew a direct line from Joseph's suspicion to Isabella's learning, presuming these two to be causally related, and inferred 'entailment'. Nevertheless, the prompt provides that one person's understanding, suspicion, or belief does not equate to another's. In this case, Joseph's suspicion does not ensure Isabella's learning.

The underlying issue seems to be the model's misinterpretation of prompt instructions asking it to disregard subjective individual content such as beliefs, suspicions, and understandings, and its subsequent creation of definite relations based on the mention of a common second person in the premise and the hypothesis. 

The prompt could provide clearer instructions, specifically emphasizing that the model should not presume causality based just on the mention of a common second person in both the premise and the hypothesis. It could also explain more clearly that when person A believes or suspects something of person B, it does not guarantee that the suspicion or belief is true for person B. The prompt could also request the model to provide a reasoning for its choice, which could help uncover any misunderstandings in the instructions and aid the learning process. It might also be beneficial to provide examples of correct and incorrect applications of the prompt for the model's reference. The model's understanding could also be tested with a few initial example tasks to ensure adequate comprehension of instructions.

gradient:
<1> 
Question: 
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.

Wrong Answer Reason:
The model seems to equate the suspicion held by an individual (Joseph) as an actual event, leading to the wrong answer. This is due to the ambiguity in understanding the complexity of multilayered human interactions, suspicions, or beliefs presented in the premise. The model does not fully grasp the difference between someone's suspicion and an actual occurrence, hence concluding the wrong relation of entailment.

<2> 
Question: 
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.

Wrong Answer Reason:
Similarly, in this example, the model equates Ava's belief about Emma's suspicion as an actual suspicion. This results in the model wrongly predicting entailment. Again, the nested belief/suspicions structure seems to confuse the model, making it unable to distinguish between belief about a suspicion and the reality of that suspicion.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Clarify that perspective-based assumptions or beliefs do not equate to the actual events or facts.
2. Provide a clear understanding that the premise is just a suspicion or belief and not an actual occurrence or agreed fact.
3. The prompt could explicitly suggest that the model should analyze the premise with a level of skepticism, particularly with subjective or speculative phrases like 'suspects' or 'believes'.
4. Include an explanation about the exact meaning of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in relation to beliefs and suspicions. For instance, entailment should be a direct and factual consequence of the premise, not predicated on beliefs or suspicions.
5. Depending upon how complex the sentences can be, the model might need additional guidance on handling multiple nested premises or hypotheses.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

The model's response is: 
<answer>entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The model's response was 'non-entailment', which means it didn't find a direct relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the correct answer is 'entailment', because the premise and hypothesis both describe a similar event, albeit from the perspectives of different people (Taylor and Richard). The model may have been confused by the different perspectives and missed that the core events described in the premise and hypothesis were the same.

Wrong Example 2:
In this instance, the model again incorrectly identifies the connection as 'entailment', when it should be 'non-entailment'. As per the prompt instructions, just because 'Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium', it doesn't necessarily mean that 'Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium'. The model appears to be misunderstanding that suspicions and beliefs, while they may guide individuals' understandings, do not confirm the absolute reality.

Wrong Example 3:
This example makes the same mistake as the previous one. The model misinterprets 'Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping' as an absolute truth, asserting an entailment with 'Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping' which may not be true in reality.

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt
Based on these observations, potential improvements for the prompt could include:
1. Emphasizing the difference between perceived and absolute events and understanding that "beliefs", "suspicions" or "understanding" from different individuals are not verifiable truths and should not be taken as such.
2. Making clear in the instructions that the task is not just about drawing parallels or finding similarities between the statements, but about evaluating whether the hypothesis is a guaranteed consequence of the premise.
3. Providing additional examples illustrating this distinction to help the model develop a more accurate understanding of entailment and non-entailment situations. 
4. Underscoring the focus on the events or facts, not the perspectives of different people in the premise and the hypothesis.

gradient:
1. Wrong example analysis:

   In the provided example, the model selected 'entailment' as the answer. This could be because it inferred that since Ava believes that Emma suspects something, it must be a fact that Emma does suspect that thing. However, as the prompt explains: the point of view or belief of one individual (Ava, in this case) doesn't necessarily mean the same applies to another individual (Emma). Ava's belief does not validate Emma's suspicions. 

   Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
   
   a. The prompt's explanation about the subjective elements like beliefs, suspicions, or personal understandings and how they don't validate a hypothesis may not be clear and explicit enough for the model to grasp.
   
   b. The prompt could be better structured to explicitly indicate that the belief or assumption of an individual about another individual should not be considered a validation of that belief or assumption.
   
   c. The instruction about bypassing common references between premise and hypothesis might be confusing for the model. It could be misunderstood as bypassing the references entirely instead of properly assessing them.

Suggestions to improve the prompt:
   
   a. Make a more explicit instruction about the irrelevant nature of subjective elements like beliefs, suspicions, or personal understandings in determining the validity of a hypothesis.
   
   b. Clearly express that any anecdotal belief or suspicion from one individual about another cannot be used to prove the truth of the suspected action or belief.
   
   c. Instead of the vague instruction to "bypass" common references, instruct the model to evaluate these references critically without letting them determine the decision.
  
   The revised version of the prompt could be:

   The task is to analyze the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis. You should determine whether the hypothesis 'entails' or is 'non-entailed' by the premise, meaning if the hypothesis unquestionably follows from the premise or if the premise does not confirm the truth of the hypothesis. Be cautious about incorporating beliefs, suspicions, or personal understandings of one individual about another individual while arriving at your decision. It's crucial to understand that these elements, even if common to multiple subjects, do not provide solid ground to certify a hypothesis. In other words, the presence of a belief, suspicion or understanding about a person by another person, does not validate those beliefs or suspicions in reality. Ensure your reasoning is logical and founded solely on the facts within the premise and hypothesis, and not on the assumptions based on shared references between the two. Deliver your decision within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Wrong Example 1 Analysis:

In the first example, the premise is "Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping,” and the hypothesis is "Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.”
The model's answer is A, 'entailment'. However, the correct answer is B, 'non-entailment'. 

Though the hypothesis is derived from the premise, it doesn't meet the criteria for 'entailment' because Ava's belief doesn't necessarily ensure that Emma does suspect that three kids are performing a skit about camping. This information is presented from Ava's perspective and it doesn't confirm the truth of Emma's suspicions. 

It seems that the model ignored the crucial aspect of the prompt where it states that just because person A believes something about person B, it doesn't necessarily confirm or validate same for person B.

Wrong Example 2 Analysis:
The premise here is "Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium,” and the hypothesis is "Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.”
Similar to the first example, the model's answer is A, 'entailment'. However, the correct answer is B, 'non-entailment' for same reasoning.

This misinterpretation happens because the model has not been designed to fully consider the aspect of the prompt that emphasizes the subjective elements of beliefs and suspicions, and how they do not validate the truth of a situation for another individual.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. The language used in the prompt should be reviewed to ensure they emphasize the non-transferability of beliefs and suspicions. This might help the model in properly discrediting the truth value of personal beliefs and suspicions in deciding the hypothesis.

2. The model should understand that the belief or suspicion of one person doesn't provide any certainty about its validity for another person. Hence, the prompt should further highlight this.

3. The model should be trained to not only focus on the surface-level similarity between the premise and the hypothesis. More guidelines should be given in the prompt to avoid this.

4. Instructions should be clearer in stating that personal understandings do not automatically confirm the hypothesis. There should be an explicit mention that if the hypothesis is based on one person's beliefs, suspicions or understanding of another, then it cannot be considered as an entailment.

5. The prompt should provide an explicit example involving beliefs, suspicions or understanding that clarifies this for the model.

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Options: (A) entailment (B) non-entailment

Model's Response: (A) entailment. 

Correct Label: B

Explanation: The error made by the language model in this example revolves around the misinterpretation of whose beliefs or suspicions should be considered. From the premise, it is what Ava believes about Emma's suspicions, and not what Emma actually suspects. In this case, the model should have recognized that Ava's belief does not automatically confirm Emma's actual belief. 

Issue 1: Misunderstanding of subjective elements - The prompt's directives hinted at the possibility of this confusion, stating, "Just because person A believes, suspects, or understands something about person B, this does not confirm person B's actions or beliefs.” However, the model overlooked this instruction during its analysis, leading to the incorrect answer.

Issue 2: Assumptions - The model made assumptions about common references between the premise and the hypothesis. It seemed to assume that because Ava believes Emma suspects something, then Emma actually does suspect it. The prompt did instruct that assumptions based on common references should be bypassed, but it appeared ineffective in this case.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
1. Make the instruction about subjective elements more explicit: This may include having an example or better explanation about how indirect beliefs or claims (like in this question Ava's beliefs about Emma's views) should not be automatically accepted as facts.

2. Reiterate the non-assumption rule: Highlight that the language model should avoid making assumptions about shared themes or elements in both the premise and the hypothesis.

3. Simplify the instruction: The current prompt gives a lot of detailed information which might confuse the language model. Breaking down the instructions into simpler segments might help the language model better understand what is being asked. 

4. Provide examples: While the instructions are fairly in-depth and cover a lot of ground, they lack practical examples that could anchor these theoretical principles and guide their application. Including examples might facilitate the transfer of these principles into practice. 

Overall, the language model needs to better understand and apply the principles of subjective beliefs and assumptions from the given instruction. Changes in the prompt could include simplification, explicit clarification, and practical examples.

gradient:
Incorrect Example 1:

The model incorrectly identifies the relationship as 'entailment'. The premise states that "Joseph suspects" something about Isabella. That Joseph suspects something does not necessarily make it true. Therefore, the information about what Isabella learns is not certain and thus there's no 'entailment'. The model misinterpreted the prompt's instruction about entailment: "Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true." The model seemed to overlook the uncertainty introduced by the verb 'suspects', causing it to give the wrong answer.

Incorrect Example 2:

Again, the model incorrectly identifies the relationship as 'entailment'. The premise states that "Ava believes" something about Emma. Just as in Example 1, the premise introduces uncertainty through the verb 'believes', meaning the hypothesis is not necessarily true. Yet, the model incorrectly picks 'entailment' as the answer, perhaps misinterpreting the instructive part of the prompt just as it did in Example 1.

Improvements:

1. Clarify entailment: You could further clarify the concept of entailment in the prompt. Explain that for entailment to apply, the premise must lead to the hypothesis with certainty. The use of verbs that imply belief, suspicion, or doubt do not fulfill this condition.

2. Concrete examples: Include examples in your prompt, showing correctly identified 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' cases. This could give the model a practical understanding of how to apply the given instructions.

3. Explicit mention: State explicitly that the relationship can also be influenced by the verbs used in the premise, which might introduce uncertainties or assumptions, and that these situations do not constitute an 'entailment'.

4. Probing questions: To help the model discern entailment from non-entailment, you might include a few probing questions that the model should consider, such as: "Is the hypothesis unquestionably true if the premise is true?" or "Does the premise introduce any form of uncertainty, belief, or assumption?".

For example 1:
The language model might have issues understanding the nuanced difference between the terms "believes" and "suspects". While "Ava believes that Emma suspects" might sound close to an actual confirmation, it is not necessarily true that "Emma suspects". The vague situation created might cause misclassification by the model.

For example 2:
A similar issue occurs here as with the first example where the terms "suspects" and "learns" might be causing confusion for the model. Just because "Joseph suspects that Isabella learns" something does not necessarily mean "Isabella learns" that something.

Aspects that could lead to the wrong answer:
1. The complexity and layered structure of the sentences might confuse the model.
2. The subtle differences in meaning between "believes", "suspects", and "learns" might not be fully comprehend by the model.
3. The model could be struggling with accurately detecting the difference between direct narration and indirect belief/suspicion.
4. Misinterpretation of the terms "entailment" and "non-entailment" might be happening.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:
1. A more detailed explanation of the terms "entailment" and "non-entailment".
2. Examples given to illustrate the difference between direct narration and indirect belief/suspicions, and how that affects the classification as entailment or non-entailment.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first question, the premise is about Joseph's suspicion, while the hypothesis involves Isabella's learning. The model seems to have missed the distinction between the two different subjects (Joseph and Isabella), which influenced their perception of the same event – a woman standing at the podium. The prompt instructed the model to pay attention to whether a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses, but it did not put enough emphasis on the importance of the premise subject. Therefore, the language model chose 'entailment', while the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'.

Wrong Example 2:

Similarly, in the second question, the premise is about Ava's belief, and the hypothesis involves Emma's suspicion. Again, the model seems to have overlooked the critical difference between what Ava believes and what Emma might suspect. Just because Ava believes something about Emma's suspicions does not guarantee Emma's actual suspicions. The prompt failed to reiterate the importance of understanding individual assumptions, perceptions, or beliefs which might influence the causal relationship between the hypothesis and the premise. Hence, the model again chose 'entailment', while the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Place emphasis on understanding individual assumptions, perceptions, or beliefs represented within the premise and hypothesis.
2. Encourage the model to pay more attention to 'who' is doing 'what' in the premises and hypotheses. Each subject's perspective and understanding of the situation is crucial to classify the relationship correctly.
3. Ensure clarity in explaining the definition and application of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The model should be able to distinguish whether the truth of the hypothesis indeed follows from the premise.
4. Enhance the need for discerning a causal relationship between premises and hypotheses.
5. Provide more explicit guidelines for exploring the options of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', with regards to how they relate to the specificity or generality of the premise and hypothesis.

Just because Ava believes something about Emma's suspicions does not guarantee Emma's actual suspicions. The prompt failed to reiterate the importance of understanding individual assumptions, perceptions, or beliefs which might influence the causal relationship between the hypothesis and the premise. Hence, the model again chose 'entailment', while the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Place emphasis on understanding individual assumptions, perceptions, or beliefs represented within the premise and hypothesis.
2. Encourage the model to pay more attention to 'who' is doing 'what' in the premises and hypotheses. Each subject's perspective and understanding of the situation is crucial to classify the relationship correctly.
3. Ensure clarity in explaining the definition and application of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The model should be able to distinguish whether the truth of the hypothesis indeed follows from the premise.
4. Enhance the need for discerning a causal relationship between premises and hypotheses.
5. Provide more explicit guidelines for exploring the options of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', with regards to how they relate to the specificity or generality of the premise and hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by evaluating whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true. Be attentive to understand if a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses. Your answer choice should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Example Explanation: The model incorrectly labeled the given premise-hypothesis as an 'entailment'. This error might have occurred because the model incorrectly interpreted the premise-hypothesis pair as the hypothesis being true when the premise is true. The initial prompt instructs the model to not consider statements involving one person's beliefs, suspicions, or learnings as guarantees of the truth of the hypothesis but the model may not have comprehensively understood this instruction. In this case, the model incorrectly inferred that because Joseph suspects something about Isabella, this makes it true. 

<2> Example Explanation: Again, the model incorrectly labeled the given premise-hypothesis as an 'entailment'. The initial prompt makes it clear that one person's beliefs or suspicions should not be taken as a confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. Despite this, the model incorrectly inferred that because Ava believes something about Emma's suspicions, that Emma's suspicions are true. The model may have misinterpreted the guidelines given in the initial prompt about discerning the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. 

Areas for Improvement: 

1. Reinforcing Semantics: Further clarify that the actions or beliefs of one person mentioned in the premise do not necessarily validate the hypothesis. 

2. Building on rules: Explicitly state that a person's suspicions, beliefs, or learnings mentioned in the premise do not directly make the hypothesis true unless there are other confirming factors. 

3. Examples: Provide more examples or exercises for the model to practice on, to improve its understanding of the entailment and non-entailment concept. 

4. Directness: Make the command more direct by asking the model to examine if there are any direct proofs within the premise which make the hypothesis true. 

5. Reiteration: Repeat key points in different ways to ensure understanding, e.g., emphasize that the hypothesis should not be inferred as true based purely on an individual's belief, suspicion, or knowledge, unless there is definitive proof present. 

6. Clarity: Make sure the instructions are clear, concise and communicated in a way that the machine learning model can fully comprehend.

gradient:
Examining the example, it seems that there could be a misunderstanding from the model over the nature of 'belief' and 'suspect', despite the clear instruction in the prompt. 

1. Misconstruing Subjective Terms: In the example, the words 'believes' and 'suspects' are subjective and represent Ava's perception, not necessarily the fact itself. Though the prompt clearly states that terms like 'believes', 'suspects', or 'learns' should not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, the model seems to not apply this properly.

2. Need for Further Clarification: The prompt rightly instructs to not assume that one person's beliefs or suspicions are confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. However, its constant emphasis on whether a hypothesis must be true if the premise is true might have confused the model. The example might have been firmer in asserting that someone's belief or suspicion doesn't make the corresponding hypothesis a fact.

3. Dependency on Direct Truth Correlation: The model seems to be associating 'entailment' with direct truth correlation. It's likely assuming that if Ava believes Emma suspects something, then Emma must indeed suspect it. 

To improve the prompt, we can consider revising these aspects:

1. Emphasize Importance of Perception: Stress more emphatically that words indicating personal beliefs, suspicions or assumptions should not be taken as factual entailments. This might help the model in better understanding and applying this rule.

2. Provide Necessary Examples: Instead of just providing a single example of usage, it would be helpful to provide multiple examples focusing on how belief/suspicion terms should not lead to 'entailment' decisions.

3. Reinforce Grounds for Non-Entailment: Make it clearer that a person's belief or suspicion about another person's thoughts or actions doesn't lead to confirmation of those thoughts or actions. 

4. Remove Ambiguity: Fine-tune the part of the prompt focusing on the concept of entailment to clearly illustrate the difference between subjective perceptions and factual entailments.

3. Dependency on Direct Truth Correlation: The model seems to be associating 'entailment' with direct truth correlation. It's likely assuming that if Ava believes Emma suspects something, then Emma must indeed suspect it. 

To improve the prompt, we can consider revising these aspects:

1. Emphasize Importance of Perception: Stress more emphatically that words indicating personal beliefs, suspicions or assumptions should not be taken as factual entailments. This might help the model in better understanding and applying this rule.

2. Provide Necessary Examples: Instead of just providing a single example of usage, it would be helpful to provide multiple examples focusing on how belief/suspicion terms should not lead to 'entailment' decisions.

3. Reinforce Grounds for Non-Entailment: Make it clearer that a person's belief or suspicion about another person's thoughts or actions doesn't lead to confirmation of those thoughts or actions. 

4. Remove Ambiguity: Fine-tune the part of the prompt focusing on the concept of entailment to clearly illustrate the difference between subjective perceptions and factual entailments.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by evaluating whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true. Be attentive to understand if a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses. Your answer choice should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to discern the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, determining if they illustrate 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. It's important to note that the use of terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Avoid assuming that one person's beliefs or suspicions are confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. Specify your answer by including your option within <answer> and </answer>. For example, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a direct truth correlation ('non-entailment'), place (B) between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

response:
<START>
In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Take note, terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning such as "believes", "suspects", and "learns" do not automatically validate the hypothesis as being true. This is because these terms merely reflect a person's perception, which may differ from reality. Hence, avoid concluding that a person's beliefs or suspicions automatically authenticate another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should fit the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a necessitated truth correlation (i.e., 'non-entailment'), write your response like so: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Please note that the assumption that a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning or other subjective thoughts should not be taken as a direct implication of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Always interrogate whether the hypothesis would have to be true if the premise was true, regardless of one's personal views or beliefs incorporated in the premise. 

In order to have a clear understanding, consider multiple examples, especially those containing belief/suspicion terms to determine if they lead to entailment or non-entailment decisions, and make sure that the context doesn't confirm the others' thoughts or actions based on someone's belief.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question examination: The task here is to discern the relationship between the premise (Joseph suspects that Isabella learns something) and the hypothesis (Isabella learns that something). The model is asked to determine whether there is an 'entailment' between the two, meaning that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. 

Wrong answer analysis: The model has chosen (A) entailment, implying that Joseph's suspicion automatically makes the hypothesis - Isabella learning something - a reality. This however is a misconception, as the task prompt explicitly states that the use of words like "suspects" and "learns" in the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. The correct option should have been (B) non-entailment, given that Joseph's suspicion doesn't confirm that Isabella has learnt something.

Reason for mistake: The model seems to have misunderstood or overlooked the instruction that one person's beliefs or suspicions cannot be taken as confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. It may be perceiving any relational or causal pattern between premise and hypothesis, and choosing 'entailment'.

<2> 
Question examination: Similar to the 1st question, the model needs to discern the relationship between the premise (Ava believes that Emma suspects something) and the hypothesis (Emma suspects something). 

Wrong answer analysis: The model has chosen (A) entailment, wrongly insinuating that Ava's belief validates the hypothesis that 'Emma suspects something'. The correct response should have been (B) non-entailment, since Ava's belief does not make Emma's suspicion a truth.

Reason for mistake: The model seems to be treating beliefs, suspicions or perceptions of one person as factual confirmation of another person’s knowledge or actions, despite this being explicitly forbidden in the prompt.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. More clarity could be brought to the sentences regarding the non-validity of one person's beliefs, suspicions, perceptions for determining another person's actions or knowledge.

2. The model seems to struggle with understanding that words like "suspects”, "believes", or "learns" in the premise don't imply the truth of the hypothesis. It could be useful to emphasize this part by adding an example directly showing this concept when explaining the idea.

3. The instruction may also dive deeper, with clearer phrasing about 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', possibly defining both from the perspective of this specific task.

4. Including potential pitfalls or misconceptions about how the model might wrongly interpret these words could also be helpful. 

5. The instruction could be tweaked to emphasise that an ‘entailment’ is not about finding any correlation (whether direct or indirect), but only when the hypothesis is definitely true in case the premise is true.

...Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Reasoning:
• Misinterpretation of Subjectivity: The model appears to have misunderstood the independent beliefs of two different subjects (Taylor and Richard). While Taylor's understanding provides certain specific details about the cyclist's actions and surroundings, Richard's understanding is generic and vague. The premise does not imply that Richard's understanding must be correct, hence it should be non-entailment, yet the model classified it as entailment.

• Over-Reliance on Generalization: The model seems to infer from the provided premise and generalize that because Taylor understands a scenario of a man on a bicycle, Richard’s understanding, although vague, must be correct. This over-reliance on general information rather the exact verbiage led to the error.

Based on these reasons, here are some suggestions to improve the prompt:

• Emphasize on Subjectivity: Make it clearer that the understanding, beliefs, or knowledge of different individuals (subjects) are independent of each other, and one's understanding doesn't necessarily corroborate another's.

• Explain "non-entailment": Explaining non-entailment with an example where different individuals perceive the same situation can help the model. For instance, if the premise states 'Taylor understands that a cyclist is biking across a garage', and the hypothesis states 'Richard understands there is a cycling event', it would be non-entailment, as Taylor's understanding doesn't confirm Richard's.

• Stress on Matching Information: Highlight that only matching specifics in information between premise and hypothesis constitute an entailment. Ambiguities, different perspectives, or inferences don't necessarily mean entailment. 

• Address Generalization: Put emphasis on avoiding generalization. The specifics of the premise must be accurately reflected in the hypothesis for it to be considered an entailment. If these specifics don't match or are interpreted differently, it should be classified as non-entailment. 

Incorporating these changes can assist the model to differentiate between subjects, match specifics more accurately, and avoid over-generalization, thus enhancing the accuracy of results.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to analyze the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: are they in 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')? Use the notion of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis is unavoidably true if the premise is true. Take heed that a premise which includes suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" doesn't automatically make the hypothesis true. Similarly, never assume that the belief or suspicion of one person validates the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any kind of correlation, but about thoroughly discerning when the premise makes the hypothesis absolutely true. Specify your answer by including your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For instances where the premise and the hypothesis don't directly equate to each other's truthfulness ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. To elaborate, if the premise states 'Person X suspects that person Y learns something', it is non-entailment, because Person X's suspicion doesn't confirm that Person Y has learnt something. Keep in mind, suspicions or beliefs of one person are not factual confirmations of another's knowledge or actions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by evaluating whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true. Be attentive to understand if a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses. Your answer choice should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Apply the concept of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. It's important to note that the use of terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Avoid assuming that one person's beliefs or suspicions are confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. Specify your answer by including your option within <answer> and </answer>. For example, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a direct truth correlation ('non-entailment'), place (B) between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.
(3) Your task is to analyze the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: are they in 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example Analysis:

In this example instance, the prompt leads the model to a wrong answer potentially due to a variety of reasons:

1. Overemphasis on Caution of Implications: The way the prompt is written, it heavily emphasizes the distinction of implications created by suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns". This diversion in the task's description may have caused the model to mistakenly treat all such terms as grounds for non-entailment, disregarding the context.

2. Lack of Explanation on Inter-Personal Contexts: Although the prompt warns not to assume that the belief or suspicion of one person validates the knowledge of another person, it didn’t clarify instances where a person's belief or suspicion might validate that another person harbors a similar belief/suspicion. In this particular case, Robert "remembering" that Richard "assumes" something does support Richard actually assuming it.

3. Misinterpretation of Relationships: The model seems to interpret the terms of person-to-person interactions and truthfulness too strictly. It doesn't seem to understand that even if the premise involves a suggestive term, it could still lead to entailment depending on the wording or relationships in the sentences.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Provide Clearer Definitions: The definition of 'entailment' should be described more accurately in the prompt. Also illustrate its application in scenarios involving terms like "believes", "suspects", etc. 

2. Better Elaboration of Person-to-Person Contexts: Convey explicitly that the presence of a third party (in this case "Robert") recalling or confirming another person’s thoughts or actions doesn’t negate the possibility of entailment.

3. Hypothetical Examples: Provide an example that aligns more closely with the specific situation the model had trouble with, such as “If 'Person X recalls that Person Y presumes something,' it can be considered entailment since Person X's recollection validates Person Y's presumption.”

4. Enhanced Flexibility: Encourage the model to be more flexible in understanding and interpreting the relationships and interactions between people in the premise and hypothesis. 

5. Address Complexity: Elaborate that complexities in a premise do not necessarily lead to non-entailment, but should be considered in terms of the relationship to the hypothesis.

By incorporating these adjustments, the revised prompt can enhance the model's comprehension and application of entailment, leading to more accurate predictions.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
In this example, the premise explains that someone named Taylor acknowledges a specific scene describing a cyclist in a unique outfit (red and white uniform) riding through a crowded garage. However, the hypothesis generally states that Richard knows there is a man biking, with no reference to the specific details in the premise.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

1. Insufficient Clarity: The prompt doesn't sufficiently clarify the entailment should adhere to the exact details in both the premise and the hypothesis.
2. Assumption: The model assumes that if two statements discuss the same core concept (in this case, someone riding a bike), it counts as an entailment, when, in fact, the details differ in each statement.
3. Misinterpretation of Entailment: The model may have misunderstood the concept of entailment as the premise involving a man riding a bike and the hypothesis as well. However, entailment should refer to the premise guaranteeing the hypothesis's truth.
4. No Specificity: The language model may have taken a generic view without considering specific details - a cyclist in a red and white uniform is different from just a man riding a bike.
5. Ignoring Knowledge Transfer Restrictions: The model didn't adhere to the rule that one person's knowledge or understanding (Taylor) doesn't necessarily transfer to another person (Richard).

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. The prompt needs to underline that entailment requires both general and specific details in the hypothesis to be unavoidably true if the premise is true.
2. Ensure language model understands that it should not assume a general correlation to be an entailment when it lacks entailment in specific details.
3. Provide more examples to clarify the concept of entailment vs. non-entailment.
4. Stress that understanding or knowledge isn't transferable between individuals unless explicitly stated.
5. The introduction of gradations to entailment, such as partial entailment or full entailment, might be beneficial for clarity.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by evaluating whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true. Be attentive to understand if a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses. Your answer choice should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to discern the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, determining if they illustrate 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. It's important to note that the use of terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Avoid assuming that one person's beliefs or suspicions are confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. Specify your answer by including your option within <answer> and </answer>. For example, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a direct truth correlation ('non-entailment'), place (B) between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.
(3) Your task is to analyze the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: are they in 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')? Use the notion of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis is unavoidably true if the premise is true. Take heed that a premise which includes suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" doesn't automatically make the hypothesis true. Similarly, never assume that the belief or suspicion of one person validates the actions or knowledge of another person.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your task is to analyze and classify the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it should make the hypothesis absolutely and unavoidably true, considering all specifics and details. An 'entailment' situation excludes both assumptions and probabilistic outcomes. Please take note that the presence of suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not make the hypothesis automatically true. Furthermore, never consider one person's belief or suspicion to substantiate the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any type of correlation or similarity, but about thoroughly discerning when every detail in the hypothesis is undeniably supported by the premise. Indicate your answer by inserting your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For cases where the premise and the hypothesis don't make an exact match in the truthfulness of all details ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Similarly, if the premise claims 'Sarah believes that John knows a secret', it is a non-entailment situation, since Sarah's belief doesn't indisputably confirm that John indeed knows a secret. Carefully remember, beliefs or suspicions of one person do not constitute undeniable confirmations of another person's knowledge or actions. Look at the premise and the hypothesis critically, evaluate each detail, and base your decision on the premise’s ability to absolutely validate the hypothesis without leaving room for doubt or assumption. <END>

cur_prompt: In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Take note, terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning such as "believes", "suspects", and "learns" do not automatically validate the hypothesis as being true. This is because these terms merely reflect a person's perception, which may differ from reality. Hence, avoid concluding that a person's beliefs or suspicions automatically authenticate another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should fit the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a necessitated truth correlation (i.e., 'non-entailment'), write your response like so: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Please note that the assumption that a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning or other subjective thoughts should not be taken as a direct implication of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Always interrogate whether the hypothesis would have to be true if the premise was true, regardless of one's personal views or beliefs incorporated in the premise. 

In order to have a clear understanding, consider multiple examples, especially those containing belief/suspicion terms to determine if they lead to entailment or non-entailment decisions, and make sure that the context doesn't confirm the others' thoughts or actions based on someone's belief.

In order to have a clear understanding, consider multiple examples, especially those containing belief/suspicion terms to determine if they lead to entailment or non-entailment decisions, and make sure that the context doesn't confirm the others' thoughts or actions based on someone's belief.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Examining the Incorrect Response:
1. In the given example, the model incorrectly classified the relationship as 'entailment'. The premise states that "Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping" and the hypothesis is "Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping". Despite the premise containing the same statement as the hypothesis, there is a layer of personal belief involved, which was specifically cautioned against in the prompt.
   
2. The model may have encountered difficulties in understanding the complex structure of the premise, where one person's (Ava's) belief about another person's (Emma's) suspicion is discussed. The model may have directly linked Ava's belief with the actionable event, ignoring the subjective nature of beliefs and suspicions.

Reasons Why the Prompt Leads to the Wrong Answer:
1. While the prompt mentions that terms indicating personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning should not automatically validate the hypothesis, it may not be clear to the model what this entails. The model might have understood this as only relative to the person whose beliefs or suspicions are being considered, not interpreting that this extends to a third-party perspective.

2. The prompt does not explicitly mention or clarify how to handle premises that involve nested subjective expressions, such as a person's belief about another person's suspicion.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:
1. Enhanced Clarity: The prompt should stress that terms indicative of personal beliefs or perceptions do not validate the hypothesis, even when these beliefs or perceptions are about another person's beliefs or perceptions. 

2. Direct Guidelines: The prompt should explicitly guide how to deal with complex premise structures, such as nested subjective expressions.

3. Examples: Adding examples demonstrating these distinctions and guiding how to properly answer such cases could provide a clearer understanding. 

4. Think Independently: Emphasize the need to consider each person's thoughts independently rather than linking them without reasonable evidence. 

So an improved prompt would look something like this:

"In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and corresponding hypothesis, categorizing them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' refers only to instances where the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion from the premise.

Remember, merely using terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning, even when these beliefs or suspicions are about someone else's thoughts or actions, don't inherently validate the hypothesis. These expressions are individual perceptions and can differ greatly from objective reality. 

For complex premises involving multiple individuals' beliefs or suspicions, examine each person's thoughts independently. Avoid jumping to conclusions about one person's thoughts or actions merely based on someone else's beliefs or suspicions.

Your answer should follow the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. If you conclude non-entailment – that the truth of the hypothesis is not necessitated by the premise, your response should appear as: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Be critical in your examination of the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Even with belief- or suspicion-related terms, discern the truth value of the hypothesis independent from any personal views or beliefs present in the premise. Your goal is to classify instances based on whether the hypothesis would necessarily be true if the premise is true, not based on one's subjective perspectives indicated in the premise."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Take note, terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning such as "believes", "suspects", and "learns" do not automatically validate the hypothesis as being true. This is because these terms merely reflect a person's perception, which may differ from reality. Hence, avoid concluding that a person's beliefs or suspicions automatically authenticate another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should fit the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a necessitated truth correlation (i.e., 'non-entailment'), write your response like so: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by evaluating whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true. Be attentive to understand if a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses. Your answer choice should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to discern the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, determining if they illustrate 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. It's important to note that the use of terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Avoid assuming that one person's beliefs or suspicions are confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. Specify your answer by including your option within <answer> and </answer>. For example, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a direct truth correlation ('non-entailment'), place (B) between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.
(3) In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Overemphasis on Subjective Terms: The prompt emphasizes heavily on not considering subjective terms like "believes" and "suspects" as definitive indicators of the truth of the hypothesis. This could potentially confuse the model. In the given example, despite the premise clearly claiming Ava's belief about Emma's suspicion, the model concluded that as 'entailment'. This could be due to the overemphasis on considering personal beliefs and suspicions, which led the model to overcompensate and view subjective terms as more indicative of a relation than they are.
  
2. Non-Clear Definition of the Task: While the prompt introduces the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', it does not clearly define or give explicit examples of what each of these entails. There is ambiguity in the description of how to differentiate between the two, leading to the model making an incorrect prediction.

3. Format Inconsistency: The prompt mentions an explanation following <answer> tag along with answer options. But, the format is not followed in the examples provided, causing a possible confusion for the model about what should be included in the <answer> tag.

4. No Direct Relational Instruction: There is lack of clarity in identifying the direct relationship between the hypothesis and premise. The model is instructed to take into account the beliefs and suspicions, which are aspects of indirect relationship. This could potentially lead the model to take a convoluted route to reach the conclusion.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:
1. Clearer Definitions: Provide clear and explicit definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', and concrete examples to help the model understand the differentiation better.
2. Balanced Emphasis: While mentioning the role of subjective terms, ensure there is a balanced emphasis so that the model doesn't overcompensate or disregard these factors.
3. Format Consistency: Make sure the explanation is included in the format of the examples as well, to keep it consistent with the instructions.
4. Direct Relational Instruction: The prompt should emphasize the direct relationship between hypothesis and premise and how to determine the truth of hypothesis solely based on the premise facts.
5. Encourage Critical Evaluation: Reinforce the idea of critically evaluating if the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion from the premise. Despite subjective terms being present, the model should evaluate the clear facts presented.

5. Encourage Critical Evaluation: Reinforce the idea of critically evaluating if the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion from the premise. Despite subjective terms being present, the model should evaluate the clear facts presented.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by evaluating whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Entailment applies when the hypothesis is necessarily true given that the premise is true. Be attentive to understand if a causal relationship exists between the premises and hypotheses. Your answer choice should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to discern the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, determining if they illustrate 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis must be true if the premise is true. It's important to note that the use of terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Avoid assuming that one person's beliefs or suspicions are confirmation of another person's knowledge or actions. Specify your answer by including your option within <answer> and </answer>. For example, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a direct truth correlation ('non-entailment'), place (B) between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.
(3) In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Take note, terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning such as "believes", "suspects", and "learns" do not automatically validate the hypothesis as being true. This is because these terms merely reflect a person's perception, which may differ from reality. Hence, avoid concluding that a person's beliefs or suspicions automatically authenticate another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should fit the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a necessitated truth correlation (i.e., 'non-entailment'), write your response like so: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Please note that the assumption that a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning or other subjective thoughts should not be taken as a direct implication of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Always interrogate whether the hypothesis would have to be true if the premise was true, regardless of one's personal views or beliefs incorporated in the premise. 

In order to have a clear understanding, consider multiple examples, especially those containing belief/suspicion terms to determine if they lead to entailment or non-entailment decisions, and make sure that the context doesn't confirm the others' thoughts or actions based on someone's belief.

In this task, you are to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, and classify this relationship as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the term 'entailment' only when the statement in the hypothesis is an inescapable conclusion if the information given in the premise is true. On the other hand, if the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion drawn in the hypothesis, the relationship should be classified as 'non-entailment'. 

Bear in mind that the representation of personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning in terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" do not guarantee the truthfulness of the hypothesis since these terms reflect a person's perception, which can be biased or inaccurate. Therefore, desist from taking one person's beliefs or suspicions as the ultimate validation of another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should adhere to the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion in the hypothesis (i.e., 'non-entailment'), your response should look thus: <answer>(B) non-entailment because the premise does not unavoidably lead to the conclusion drawn in the hypothesis</answer>.

Be aware that subjective thoughts incorporated in the premise, such as a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning, etc., should not be presumed as direct indicators of the hypothesis' veracity. To fulfil the task suitably, critically assess whether the hypothesis has to be true if the information in the premise is true, regardless of subjective elements presented therein.
 
Review several examples to gain better insight. Particularly look at examples that make use of belief/suspicion terms, and critically examine whether or not these examples lead to 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' decisions. Be sure not to confirm other persons' thoughts or actions solely based on the belief of another expressed in the premise.

Examining the Wrong Example:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping. 

The model's response is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B (non-entailment)
The model's prediction is: A (entailment).

Reasons for Wrong Response:

1. Misinterpretation of Direct Causality: The current prompt encourages the language model to seek a direct causal connection between premise and hypothesis. However, in this example, the belief of one person (Ava) about another person's suspicions (Emma's) does not establish actual confirmation of Emma's suspicions, thus, making it a 'non-entailment'. In simpler terms, the model failed to uphold the teaching of the prompt that a person's beliefs or suspicions do not necessarily portray reality accurately.

2. Misunderstanding of relativity: The language model might have misunderstood the relative nature of the premise and hypothesis. While the hypothesis is directly mentioned in the premise, it doesn't necessarily make it true because it is depending on Ava's belief, not on an objective fact. 

3. Failure to Discard Subjectivity: Despite the detailed explanation in the prompt that subjective terms such as "believes", "suspects", "learns" do not validate the hypothesis automatically, the model seemingly overlooks this rule during classification.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Reiterate the Rule: The prompt can emphasize more firmly that personal beliefs, suspicions, or subjective thoughts can not act as conclusive proof for a hypothesis.

2. Introduce Counter Examples: The prompt could benefit from introducing a few counter examples, especially those that include belief/suspicion statements like the one in the wrong example.

3. Direct relationship warning: It might help to explicitly mention that a premise containing the hypothesis verbatim does not necessarily mean there is an entailment, particularly if it involves personal beliefs or suspicions.

4. Highlight Absence of Direct Proof: Additional emphasis could be placed on the idea that without direct evidence or facts presented in the premise, the existence of subjective beliefs does not entail the truth of the hypothesis. 

These changes should fortify the model's understanding of entailment and non-entailment classifications when subjective beliefs or suspicions are involved in the premise.

response:
<START> 

In this task, your objective is to ascertain the relationship between a given premise and its corresponding hypothesis. You should classify them under one of two categories: 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' strictly when the truth of the hypothesis can be absolutely deduced from the premise.

Importantly, you must not assume that terms implying personal beliefs, suspicions, learning, or other subjective notions like "believes", "suspects", and "thinks" validate the hypothesis automatically. These words indicate an individual's subjective viewpoint which may or may not be aligned with reality. Therefore, a person's beliefs or suspicions should not be considered as certified evidence of another individual’s knowledge or actions.

Your answer must be formatted as <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For example, if you deduce that the premise and hypothesis do not have a directly linked truth correlation or 'non-entailment', your response should look like this: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

It is crucial to emphasize that the presence of an individual's beliefs, suspicions, or subjective ideas in the premise does not automatically infer the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Therefore, closely scrutinize whether the hypothesis would still hold true if the premise was true, regardless of the personal views or beliefs incorporated.

To ensure that you fully grasp these concepts, review multiple examples. Pay particular attention to examples which include belief/suspicion terms to understand how they influence the entailment or non-entailment of decisions. Always remember that the context should not confirm someone else's thoughts or actions based purely on one individual's belief or suspicion.

Even if a premise contains the exact wording of the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean there is an entailment, especially when it involves the beliefs or suspicions of individuals. Without concrete evidence or facts presented in the premise, the existence of subjective beliefs does not spurn the truth of the hypothesis. 

Your aim is to accurately interpret the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping the subjectivity of personal beliefs, suspicions, and learning in mind.

Without concrete evidence or facts presented in the premise, the existence of subjective beliefs does not spurn the truth of the hypothesis. 

Your aim is to accurately interpret the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping the subjectivity of personal beliefs, suspicions, and learning in mind.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in a detailed manner, taking into consideration the difference in subjects or people mentioned. 'Entailment' should be chosen when there is absolute certainty that the premise results in the hypothesis being true, without consideration of any unfounded assumptions or inferences.

This includes situations based on personal understandings such as beliefs or suspicions, or when multiple people might interpret the same event in different ways. 

Dealing with specific and generalized representations, consider specifics in the hypothesis as applicable to the more general premise, unless contradictory. When subjects or individuals involved perceive the same events differently, interpret the sentences from each point of view and use the principle of charity to determine the best fit. 

Do not merely focus on making no assumptions. Instead, limit unnecessary hypotheses but enable reasonable assumptions that cater to natural language understanding to deduce a possible connection, only if these connections are reasonable and not clearly contradicted by the text.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis. Choose 'entailment' if the premise with absolute certainty and without making inferences or assumptions, leads to the truthfulness of the hypothesis. Select 'non-entailment' when the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, particularly when it involves subjective experiences such as beliefs or suspicions, which cannot definitively establish the truth of the hypothesis.

Be cautious of words that introduce uncertainty to the premise like 'suspects', and ensure not to view them as solid evidence. Avoid making assumptions beyond what is objectively stated in the premise and hypothesis, and refrain from inferring connections not explicitly stated in the material provided.

Understand, the words 'belief' and 'suspicion' denote an individual's opinion or point of view, not an established fact. Keep in mind that two individuals may perceive the same event differently, so their respective assertions cannot be taken as a universally accepted truth.

Once the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is discerned, wrap the selected option, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', within <answer> and </answer> tags. Please ensure that your selected answer is in full agreement with your reasoning.

For illustration:

Premise: James believes that kids love the new toy craze.
Hypothesis: Kids love the new toy craze.

Here, 'entailment' is incorrect since James' belief does not establish it as a fact that kids indeed love the new toy craze – this would be a 'non-entailment'.

Now perform this analysis on the following premise-hypothesis pairs and enclose the answer, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', in <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Consider the premise and the hypothesis presented. The essential task is to identify whether the premise categorically dictates the truth of the hypothesis. Hence, select 'entailment' only if the premise absolutely substantiates every detail of the hypothesis as true, beyond any shadow of doubt or room for interpretation. Choose 'non-entailment' whenever the given premise doesn't provide a full-proof guarantee for the hypothesis to be true. It's crucial to stay focused on the entity and action described in the premise and hypothesis, regardless of whose memory, understanding, or assumption these facts are originating from. Emphasis should be placed on the congruence of the actual content, not the subjectivity or source of these statements. Once you've made the appropriate selection, encase your answer between <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: are they in 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')? Use the notion of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis is unavoidably true if the premise is true. Take heed that a premise which includes suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" doesn't automatically make the hypothesis true. Similarly, never assume that the belief or suspicion of one person validates the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any kind of correlation, but about thoroughly discerning when the premise makes the hypothesis absolutely true. Specify your answer by including your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For instances where the premise and the hypothesis don't directly equate to each other's truthfulness ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. To elaborate, if the premise states 'Person X suspects that person Y learns something', it is non-entailment, because Person X's suspicion doesn't confirm that Person Y has learnt something. Keep in mind, suspicions or beliefs of one person are not factual confirmations of another's knowledge or actions.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze and classify the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it should make the hypothesis absolutely and unavoidably true, considering all specifics and details. An 'entailment' situation excludes both assumptions and probabilistic outcomes. Please take note that the presence of suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not make the hypothesis automatically true. Furthermore, never consider one person's belief or suspicion to substantiate the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any type of correlation or similarity, but about thoroughly discerning when every detail in the hypothesis is undeniably supported by the premise. Indicate your answer by inserting your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For cases where the premise and the hypothesis don't make an exact match in the truthfulness of all details ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Similarly, if the premise claims 'Sarah believes that John knows a secret', it is a non-entailment situation, since Sarah's belief doesn't indisputably confirm that John indeed knows a secret. Carefully remember, beliefs or suspicions of one person do not constitute undeniable confirmations of another person's knowledge or actions. Look at the premise and the hypothesis critically, evaluate each detail, and base your decision on the premise’s ability to absolutely validate the hypothesis without leaving room for doubt or assumption.

   prompt: In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Take note, terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning such as "believes", "suspects", and "learns" do not automatically validate the hypothesis as being true. This is because these terms merely reflect a person's perception, which may differ from reality. Hence, avoid concluding that a person's beliefs or suspicions automatically authenticate another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should fit the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a necessitated truth correlation (i.e., 'non-entailment'), write your response like so: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Please note that the assumption that a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning or other subjective thoughts should not be taken as a direct implication of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Always interrogate whether the hypothesis would have to be true if the premise was true, regardless of one's personal views or beliefs incorporated in the premise. 

In order to have a clear understanding, consider multiple examples, especially those containing belief/suspicion terms to determine if they lead to entailment or non-entailment decisions, and make sure that the context doesn't confirm the others' thoughts or actions based on someone's belief.

   prompt: In this task, your objective is to ascertain the relationship between a given premise and its corresponding hypothesis. You should classify them under one of two categories: 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' strictly when the truth of the hypothesis can be absolutely deduced from the premise.

Importantly, you must not assume that terms implying personal beliefs, suspicions, learning, or other subjective notions like "believes", "suspects", and "thinks" validate the hypothesis automatically. These words indicate an individual's subjective viewpoint which may or may not be aligned with reality. Therefore, a person's beliefs or suspicions should not be considered as certified evidence of another individual’s knowledge or actions.

Your answer must be formatted as <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For example, if you deduce that the premise and hypothesis do not have a directly linked truth correlation or 'non-entailment', your response should look like this: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

It is crucial to emphasize that the presence of an individual's beliefs, suspicions, or subjective ideas in the premise does not automatically infer the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Therefore, closely scrutinize whether the hypothesis would still hold true if the premise was true, regardless of the personal views or beliefs incorporated.

To ensure that you fully grasp these concepts, review multiple examples. Pay particular attention to examples which include belief/suspicion terms to understand how they influence the entailment or non-entailment of decisions. Always remember that the context should not confirm someone else's thoughts or actions based purely on one individual's belief or suspicion.

Even if a premise contains the exact wording of the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean there is an entailment, especially when it involves the beliefs or suspicions of individuals. Without concrete evidence or facts presented in the premise, the existence of subjective beliefs does not spurn the truth of the hypothesis. 

Your aim is to accurately interpret the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping the subjectivity of personal beliefs, suspicions, and learning in mind.

   prompt: In one or more sentences, assess whether the given premise strictly leads to the hypothesis. Select 'entailment' if the hypothesis must unavoidably be true given the premise, focusing on concrete, undeniable facts. Select 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis does not have to be true based on the premise. Bear in mind that an individual's belief or suspicion does not inherently equate to truth or fact. It's important not to infer additional information beyond what is present in the premise. Take special note when subjectivity, such as personal beliefs or suspicions, are involved. After your assessment, present your choice within <answer> and </answer>.

For example:
Premise: “A dog is a mammal.” Hypothesis: “A dog has fur.”
The answer is <answer> entailment </answer> because all mammals have fur.

Premise: “John suspects that Mary believes the earth is flat.” Hypothesis: “Mary believes the earth is flat.”
The answer is <answer> non-entailment </answer> as John's suspicion about Mary's beliefs does not constitute factual confirmation of Mary's beliefs.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, making sure to distinguish between the different subjects or individuals mentioned. 'Entailment' is the correct choice if the premise defines with absolute certainty, without relying on inferences or assumptions, the truthfulness of the hypothesis. 'Non-entailment' is to be chosen when the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, or when it is based on personal conceptions such as beliefs or suspicions, or even when two individuals may interpret the same event differently. 

Avoid making assumptions and focus on the objective elements in the premise and hypothesis. Reject any temptation to infer connections not clearly stated in the material provided. Once the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is established, present the selected option 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Consider the premise and the hypothesis presented. The essential task is to identify whether the premise categorically dictates the truth of the hypothesis. Hence, select 'entailment' only if the premise absolutely substantiates every detail of the hypothesis as true, beyond any shadow of doubt or room for interpretation. Choose 'non-entailment' whenever the given premise doesn't provide a full-proof guarantee for the hypothesis to be true. It's crucial to stay focused on the entity and action described in the premise and hypothesis, regardless of whose memory, understanding, or assumption these facts are originating from. Emphasis should be placed on the congruence of the actual content, not the subjectivity or source of these statements.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis with utmost care. Reach a decision about 'entailment' only if there is an absolute assurance that the premise confirms the hypothesis as true. Elect 'non-entailment' when the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Pay particular attention to subjective elements like beliefs, suspicions, or different individual perspectives embedded within the premise or hypothesis, as these might not always align with reality. After deciding, place your answer choice within <answer> and </answer> tags. Make sure to assess each component of the premise and hypothesis such as the characters involved, their actions, and the overall context.

   prompt: Your task involves a careful analysis of the relationship between the main argument (termed as the 'premise') and a proposed follow-up statement (termed as the 'hypothesis'). Take special note of the individuals or subjects involved and their specific viewpoints or interpretations. Choose 'entailment' when the premise directly certifies the hypothesis, with no room for doubt. Opt for 'non-entailment' when the individuals, their specific understanding, or a direct link between the events described do not unequivocally confirm the hypothesis. Do not include any assumptions or personal inferences not stated explicitly in the provided material. Finalize your analysis by enclosing the chosen option, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in a detailed manner, taking into consideration the difference in subjects or people mentioned. 'Entailment' should be chosen when there is absolute certainty that the premise results in the hypothesis being true, without consideration of any unfounded assumptions or inferences. 'Non-entailment' should be selected when the premise does not ensure the truth of the hypothesis. This includes situations based on personal understandings such as beliefs or suspicions, or when multiple people might interpret the same event in different ways. 

Dealing with specific and generalized representations, consider specifics in the hypothesis as applicable to the more general premise, unless contradictory. When subjects or individuals involved perceive the same events differently, interpret the sentences from each point of view and use the principle of charity to determine the best fit. 

Do not merely focus on making no assumptions. Instead, limit unnecessary hypotheses but enable reasonable assumptions that cater to natural language understanding to deduce a possible connection, only if these connections are reasonable and not clearly contradicted by the text. 

After deciding the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, select the fitting option – 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' - and encase it within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis. Choose 'entailment' if the premise with absolute certainty and without making inferences or assumptions, leads to the truthfulness of the hypothesis. Select 'non-entailment' when the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, particularly when it involves subjective experiences such as beliefs or suspicions, which cannot definitively establish the truth of the hypothesis.

Be cautious of words that introduce uncertainty to the premise like 'suspects', and ensure not to view them as solid evidence. Avoid making assumptions beyond what is objectively stated in the premise and hypothesis, and refrain from inferring connections not explicitly stated in the material provided.

Understand, the words 'belief' and 'suspicion' denote an individual's opinion or point of view, not an established fact. Keep in mind that two individuals may perceive the same event differently, so their respective assertions cannot be taken as a universally accepted truth.

Once the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is discerned, wrap the selected option, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', within <answer> and </answer> tags. Please ensure that your selected answer is in full agreement with your reasoning.

For illustration:

Premise: James believes that kids love the new toy craze.
Hypothesis: Kids love the new toy craze.

Here, 'entailment' is incorrect since James' belief does not establish it as a fact that kids indeed love the new toy craze – this would be a 'non-entailment'.

Now perform this analysis on the following premise-hypothesis pairs and enclose the answer, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', in <answer> and </answer> tags.

Conversely, 'non-entailment' applies if the premise doesn't ensure the hypothesis's truth. Keep in mind that subjective elements like beliefs, suspicions, or personal understandings, even if shared by multiple subjects, do not automatically validate a hypothesis. The point of view or belief of one individual doesn't necessarily apply to another. Just because person A believes, suspects, or understands something about person B, this does not confirm person B's actions or beliefs.

   prompt: Analyze the given premise and the hypothesis carefully. If the hypothesis is a direct, factual consequence of the premise, pick 'entailment'. However, if you find that the premise does not bring about a certain result in the hypothesis, or there is room for ambiguity or uncertainty, pick 'non-entailment'. While assessing, remember that individual thoughts, beliefs, suspicions, or perceptions are subjective and do not necessarily reflect the factual reality. The understanding of one person may not necessarily match the understanding of another. An important thing that you must bear in mind is that 'belief' or 'suspicion' about an event does not equate to the actual occurrence of that event. Also, be cautious when encountering premised based on nested beliefs or suspicions. Understand that 'entailment' signifies that there is a direct and unambiguous result of the premise, whereas 'non-entailment' suggests either an indirect or an uncertain result. Once you have made an informed decision, place your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Label it as 'entailment' if the hypothesis is an unconditional consequence of the premise. Conversely, label it as 'non-entailment' if the premise does not validate the accuracy of the hypothesis. During your analysis, remain mindful that personal viewpoints, such as beliefs, suspicions, or comprehendings shared among multiple subjects, should not be considered validation for a hypothesis. Individual perspectives are unique and do not establish a universal truth. Specifically, merely because one person (A) believes, suspects, or understands something about another person (B), it doesn’t provide proof about the actions or beliefs of the person (B).

   prompt: Use principled reasoning to identify the relationship between the presented premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis is undeniably a direct outcome of the premise, select 'entailment'. If the validity of the hypothesis does not assuredly originate from the premise, select 'non-entailment'. It's essential to recognize that subjective elements like personal beliefs, suspicions, or understandings, regardless of how many individuals share them, do not inherently affirm a hypothesis. Do not assume that one person's perspectives or beliefs are universally applicable or representative of another person's beliefs or actions. Especially, if a premise contains person A's beliefs, assumptions about person B, it doesn't necessarily validate the hypothesis about person B. Exercise critical thinking whilst making your choice, and steer clear of projecting presumptions based on shared references between premise and hypothesis. Encapsulate your justified choice within <answer> and </answer> tags. If the hypothesis is solely based on person A's beliefs about person B, then it won't be considered as an 'entailment', regardless of how similar the phraseology might appear in the premise and hypothesis.

   prompt: Analyze the connection between the following premise and hypothesis. Select 'entailment' if the hypothesis unavoidably arises from the premise. If the truth of the hypothesis is not guaranteed by the premise, choose 'non-entailment'. It's important to consider that subjective components such as beliefs, suspicions, or understandings do not constitute the absolute truth of a hypothesis. Person A's perspective or belief does not automatically correlate with Person B's viewpoint or belief - an individual's belief, suspicion, or understanding of another person's situation should not be mistaken for an affirmation of the latter person's actual beliefs or actions. Remember not to make assumptions about links present in both premise and hypothesis. Think critically and logically about each scenario without letting shared references cloud your judgement. Include your selected response within <answer> and </answer> tags, and avoid long-winded explanations. For example, if the premise is "Ava thinks that Emma suspects something," and the hypothesis is "Emma suspects something," the correct answer would be 'non-entailment' because Ava's belief does not confirm Emma's suspicion.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the type of relationship between the given premises and hypotheses by deciding whether they represent 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' implies that the hypothesis will unavoidably be true if the premise is true. The premise must lead to the conclusion without any doubt, assumption, or belief involved. 'Non-entailment' applies when the premise does not certainly lead to the conclusion or if it introduces any form of uncertainty, belief, or assumption. Therefore, pay special attention to the verbs used in the premise as they might imply uncertainty or belief. Make your choice between the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on above instructions.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, determining whether they represent 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' applies only when the truth of the hypothesis is a necessary result of the premise being true. Significantly, the presence of verbs like "believes", "suspects", and "learns" in the premise does not guarantee that the hypothesis is true. So, if premise involves someone's beliefs, suspicions, or learnings, do not assume that this confirms another person’s knowledge or actions. Simply put, this means that hypothesis is not necessarily true just because the premise involves someone's belief, suspicion, or learning. Keep in mind that avoiding such assumptions is crucial for your task. Make sure you choose between options 'A' (entailment) and 'B' (non-entailment) based on whether there's a direct truth correlation between the premise and hypothesis. Document your answer by placing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if you conclude that the premise and hypothesis do not share a direct truth relationship ('non-entailment'), place (B) between <answer> and </answer> such as, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

   prompt: In this task, your objective is to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying them as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). 'Entailment' should only be applied when the truth of the hypothesis is an unavoidable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Take note, terms that indicate personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning such as "believes", "suspects", and "learns" do not automatically validate the hypothesis as being true. This is because these terms merely reflect a person's perception, which may differ from reality. Hence, avoid concluding that a person's beliefs or suspicions automatically authenticate another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should fit the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise and hypothesis do not have a necessitated truth correlation (i.e., 'non-entailment'), write your response like so: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Please note that the assumption that a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning or other subjective thoughts should not be taken as a direct implication of the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Always interrogate whether the hypothesis would have to be true if the premise was true, regardless of one's personal views or beliefs incorporated in the premise. 

In order to have a clear understanding, consider multiple examples, especially those containing belief/suspicion terms to determine if they lead to entailment or non-entailment decisions, and make sure that the context doesn't confirm the others' thoughts or actions based on someone's belief.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: are they in 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')? Use the notion of 'entailment' only when the hypothesis is unavoidably true if the premise is true. Take heed that a premise which includes suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" doesn't automatically make the hypothesis true. Similarly, never assume that the belief or suspicion of one person validates the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any kind of correlation, but about thoroughly discerning when the premise makes the hypothesis absolutely true. Specify your answer by including your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For instances where the premise and the hypothesis don't directly equate to each other's truthfulness ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer> like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. To elaborate, if the premise states 'Person X suspects that person Y learns something', it is non-entailment, because Person X's suspicion doesn't confirm that Person Y has learnt something. Keep in mind, suspicions or beliefs of one person are not factual confirmations of another's knowledge or actions.

   prompt: Your task is to deeply analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, categorizing them into 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Use the concept of 'entailment' strictly when the hypothesis is unequivocally true if the premise is true. Acknowledge this: terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in a premise do not substantiate the hypothesis. Understandings or beliefs of different individuals are independent of each other; a premise about one person's understanding or belief doesn't confirm another's understanding or belief, irrespective of the seeming similarity in their content. Your task doesn't aim to identify correlations; it’s to meticulously determine when a premise indisputably establishes the truth of a hypothesis. Strive for precision in your answer by enclosing your choice between <answer> and </answer>. For scenarios where the premise and hypothesis don't assure each other’s validity ('non-entailment'), mark it as (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, rendering it as <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. For instance, if the premise is 'Taylor understands that a cyclist is biking across a garage', and the hypothesis is 'Richard understands there is a cycling event', it’s non-entailment, as Taylor's understanding doesn't guarantee Richard's hypothesis. Always remember, avoid generalizing or creating inferences based on the commonalities in the premise and hypothesis. To ensure entailment, the specifics in the hypothesis must exactly align with the premise, without room for interpretation or ambiguity.

   prompt: Your task is to discern the specific relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses: do they show 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B')? Designate it as 'entailment' (A) only if the truth of the premise invariably necessitates the truth of the hypothesis. It's imperative to understand that premises involving suggestive terminology like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" don't automatically validate the truthfulness of the hypothesis. Further, don't infer that one person's beliefs or suspicions confirm the experiences of another individual. However, be aware that inter-personal contexts varied. If another person's recollection or confirmation is included, this can support the belief or assumption of a different person, therefore making it entailment (for instance, 'Person X remembers that Person Y presumes something'). Your task is about critically analyzing to determine when the premise impeccably confirms the hypothesis. For cases where the truth of the premise and hypothesis can't directly equate ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it within <answer> and </answer> like this: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze and classify the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). For a premise to entail a hypothesis, it should make the hypothesis absolutely and unavoidably true, considering all specifics and details. An 'entailment' situation excludes both assumptions and probabilistic outcomes. Please take note that the presence of suggestive terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" in the premise does not make the hypothesis automatically true. Furthermore, never consider one person's belief or suspicion to substantiate the actions or knowledge of another person. Your task is not about identifying any type of correlation or similarity, but about thoroughly discerning when every detail in the hypothesis is undeniably supported by the premise. Indicate your answer by inserting your chosen option between <answer> and </answer>. For cases where the premise and the hypothesis don't make an exact match in the truthfulness of all details ('non-entailment'), choose (B) and place it between <answer> and </answer>, like so, <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Similarly, if the premise claims 'Sarah believes that John knows a secret', it is a non-entailment situation, since Sarah's belief doesn't indisputably confirm that John indeed knows a secret. Carefully remember, beliefs or suspicions of one person do not constitute undeniable confirmations of another person's knowledge or actions. Look at the premise and the hypothesis critically, evaluate each detail, and base your decision on the premise’s ability to absolutely validate the hypothesis without leaving room for doubt or assumption.

   prompt: In this task, you are required to discern the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, classifying it as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). The term 'entailment' should be chosen when the truth of the hypothesis is an inescapable conclusion if the premise is true. 

Even when statements embody personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning about someone else's thoughts or actions, do not take these as verification of the hypothesis. These are personal perceptions that may diverge from the objective truth. 

Should the premise involve nested subjective expressions, such as one person's belief about another's suspicion, handle them carefully. Consider each person's thoughts as separate entities, and avoid drawing conclusions about their beliefs based solely on another person's viewpoint.

Your response should follow the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. If the premise and hypothesis fail to establish a necessary truth connection (i.e., 'non-entailment'), your response should look like this: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. 

Practice critical examination and make decisions based on whether the truth of the hypothesis holds independently of personal views or subjective thoughts indicated in the premise. Your role here is to make an unbiased judgment on whether or not the hypothesis would indispensably hold true if the premise is accepted as true.

   prompt: In this task, you are to identify the relationship between a provided premise and its corresponding hypothesis, and classify this relationship as either 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the term 'entailment' only when the statement in the hypothesis is an inescapable conclusion if the information given in the premise is true. On the other hand, if the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion drawn in the hypothesis, the relationship should be classified as 'non-entailment'. 

Bear in mind that the representation of personal beliefs, suspicions, or learning in terms like "believes", "suspects", or "learns" do not guarantee the truthfulness of the hypothesis since these terms reflect a person's perception, which can be biased or inaccurate. Therefore, desist from taking one person's beliefs or suspicions as the ultimate validation of another person's knowledge or actions. 

Your answer should adhere to the format <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For instance, if you determine the premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion in the hypothesis (i.e., 'non-entailment'), your response should look thus: <answer>(B) non-entailment because the premise does not unavoidably lead to the conclusion drawn in the hypothesis</answer>.

Be aware that subjective thoughts incorporated in the premise, such as a person’s beliefs, suspicions, learning, etc., should not be presumed as direct indicators of the hypothesis' veracity. To fulfil the task suitably, critically assess whether the hypothesis has to be true if the information in the premise is true, regardless of subjective elements presented therein.
 
Review several examples to gain better insight. Particularly look at examples that make use of belief/suspicion terms, and critically examine whether or not these examples lead to 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' decisions. Be sure not to confirm other persons' thoughts or actions solely based on the belief of another expressed in the premise.

   prompt: In this task, your objective is to ascertain the relationship between a given premise and its corresponding hypothesis. You should classify them under one of two categories: 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' strictly when the truth of the hypothesis can be absolutely deduced from the premise.

Importantly, you must not assume that terms implying personal beliefs, suspicions, learning, or other subjective notions like "believes", "suspects", and "thinks" validate the hypothesis automatically. These words indicate an individual's subjective viewpoint which may or may not be aligned with reality. Therefore, a person's beliefs or suspicions should not be considered as certified evidence of another individual’s knowledge or actions.

Your answer must be formatted as <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For example, if you deduce that the premise and hypothesis do not have a directly linked truth correlation or 'non-entailment', your response should look like this: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

It is crucial to emphasize that the presence of an individual's beliefs, suspicions, or subjective ideas in the premise does not automatically infer the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Therefore, closely scrutinize whether the hypothesis would still hold true if the premise was true, regardless of the personal views or beliefs incorporated.

To ensure that you fully grasp these concepts, review multiple examples. Pay particular attention to examples which include belief/suspicion terms to understand how they influence the entailment or non-entailment of decisions. Always remember that the context should not confirm someone else's thoughts or actions based purely on one individual's belief or suspicion.

Even if a premise contains the exact wording of the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean there is an entailment, especially when it involves the beliefs or suspicions of individuals. Without concrete evidence or facts presented in the premise, the existence of subjective beliefs does not spurn the truth of the hypothesis. 

Your aim is to accurately interpret the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping the subjectivity of personal beliefs, suspicions, and learning in mind.
