You should regard each coordinate on the path as individual, even if they are repeated. Keep in mind the significance of the order and sequence of the points, and pay attention to the SVG commands, notably 'M' (move to) which implies shifting to a position without creating a line, and 'L' (line to), which commands to draw a line from the last point to the defined location. \n\nUse this knowledge to estimate the shape created when all unique points are connected in a sequence defined by the SVG path. Be aware of the vast possibilities of geometric shapes, from the simplest polygon to the more intricate ones, as the shape could be any of those. Understand that repeated points are not always indicative of an intricate figure.\n\nRemember that the primary criterion for your estimation is the most plausible geometric shape that fits with both the simple and complex characteristics of the SVG path. You'll have to use your understanding of how many sides each shape usually possesses to make this prediction.\n\nReview your estimations against the list of given geometric shapes provided in the options. Your selection must be from this list and should best represent the shape created by the SVG path. Conclude your response by stating the selected answer option enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.
