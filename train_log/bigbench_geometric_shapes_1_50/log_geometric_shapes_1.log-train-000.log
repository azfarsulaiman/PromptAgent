- The question: Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths seems very clear for a task. However, without enough SVG knowledge, the language model may not correctly identify the shape. The language model likely interpreted "M” as Move To, “L” as Line To, and constructed a simple path, which lead it to mistakenly declare the shape as a triangle.
- The wrong answer: The language model predicted the shape as a (J) triangle, which suggests the model does not have an accurate understanding of geometric SVG paths. Alternatively, it may be the lack of information about how these SVG paths correspond to different geometric shapes causing the confusion.
- Improvement: The prompt could be improved by asking the model to calculate the number of vertices in the SVG path or consider the points in the SVG path to correctly classify the shape. Another alternative could be to include some contextual information about the nature of SVG paths and how they correspond to geometric shapes.

Based on the issues identified, here are the aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Make the model aware that SVG Paths can represent complex shapes and not just the simplest one.
2. Instead of only asking the model to name the shape, require it to interpret SVG path code to correctly identify the shape.
3. Add diagrammatical representation or examples to the prompt so that the model has a better understanding of correlating SVG paths to shapes.
4. Include clues on how to correctly identify the number of vertices or angles from SVG path.

gradient:
<1> 

Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. The question is asking the model to infer what type of geometric shape is being drawn by a specific SVG path. 

2. The SVG path given is complex and seems to represent multiple lines drawn in a specific order, rather than a simple distinct shape. 

3. The model has incorrectly inferred that the SVG path is representing a line instead of a complex geometric shape. 

4. The correct inference should have been a heptagon (given by option B). 

5. The prediction error seems to be caused by the complexity of the SVG path’s instruction, causing the model to interpret it as a single or multiple lines rather than as a complex geometric shape.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:

a. Misunderstanding Complexity: The SVG string is quite complex, and the model might have failed to understand that it represented a complex geometric shape.

b. Lack of Visualization: Unlike a human, the model cannot "visualize" the path to infer the shape. It has to rely on its understanding of the SVG paths to decode the shape, which may not always be accurate.

c. Simplistic Interpretation: The model oversimplified the SVG path and settled on it being a line, which is a simple shape that can be drawn by SVG, but not the correct answer here.

Suggestions to Improve the Prompt:

1. Make the prompt more explicit by specifying that the SVG paths may represent complex geometric shapes and its not always a simple shape as a line.

2. Consider simplifying examples or provide hints about how the SVG path represents a shape.

3. Include more training on SVG paths for the model to better grasp the relationship between SVG paths and geometric shapes.

4. Include more SVG paths that represent less simple forms, in the training data. 

5. Consider explaining SVG Commands to the model more clearly. It can help model to understand the pattern in SVG paths that signify a particular shape.

gradient:
<1> 

Examining the question: 
The question asks the model to name geometric shapes given their SVG paths. SVG paths can be complex and contain a series of instructions for plotting points to draw shapes. 

Examining the wrong answer: 
The model predicted the shape as a 'line', where in fact the correct answer is 'heptagon'. It appears that the model couldn't interpret the SVG paths correctly. 

Possible reasons for the wrong answer: 

1) Complexity of the SVG path: The SVG path contains multiple instructions which are elaborate and complex. The model may not have the ability to correctly interpret and translate these complex paths into geometric shapes.

2) Need for visual capability: To accurately name shapes from SVG paths, the model might require visual capability, which it currently lacks. 

3) Absence of explicit information: There is no explicit information in the SVG path that directly indicates it's a heptagon. It seems like the model failed to extract the correct information from the given path instructions.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1) Simplicity: The SVG paths could be simplified to a level where the model can correctly identify the shapes.

2) Provide a pre-processing step: It could be beneficial to provide a pre-processing step, where the SVG path is translated into a simpler format that the model can understand.

3) Include more details: More information could be provided, such as the number of lines, or points in the SVG path.

4) Explain how to interpret SVG paths: Train the model on how to interpret SVG paths to identify shapes.

Overall, current prompt demands a high level of understanding and interpretation of SVG paths, which may be challenging for the model. Breaking down these paths to a simpler format, providing more explicit information and teaching the model to interpret SVG paths could improve its performance.

Analysis:

1. The prompt assumes that the AI system can interpret SVG path instructions and convert it to a complex geometric shape.
3. The given task is computationally heavy, as it requires understanding of the encoded SVG path, which cannot be processed textually or verbally.
4. The latter half of the prompt instructs an end output format rather than indicating further information to assist in providing a correct response. 

Based on the above reasons the following improvements can be made:

1. Firstly, the objective of the prompt needs to be clarified and specified, as it currently requires computational calculations, and algorithms for processing SVG path data, which the AI model is unable to execute.
2. Provide the model with simplified SVG path instructions or the necessary capability to interpret such data. The task could ideally involve describing features of SVG graphics rather than identifying specific shapes. 
3. The prompt should be designed to capitalize on the strengths on the AI such as pattern recognition, context understanding, text generation etc., rather than asking it to infer complex shapes from SVG paths, a task beyond its potential.

Analysis:

1. The prompt assumes that the AI system can interpret SVG path instructions and convert it to a complex geometric shape.
3. The given task is computationally heavy, as it requires understanding of the encoded SVG path, which cannot be processed textually or verbally.
4. The latter half of the prompt instructs an end output format rather than indicating further information to assist in providing a correct response. 

Based on the above reasons the following improvements can be made:

1. Firstly, the objective of the prompt needs to be clarified and specified, as it currently requires computational calculations, and algorithms for processing SVG path data, which the AI model is unable to execute.
2. Provide the model with simplified SVG path instructions or the necessary capability to interpret such data. The task could ideally involve describing features of SVG graphics rather than identifying specific shapes. 
3. The prompt should be designed to capitalize on the strengths on the AI such as pattern recognition, context understanding, text generation etc., rather than asking it to infer complex shapes from SVG paths, a task beyond its potential.
4. The prompt can include instructions to the model about how to approach the task, instead of how to present the results. The current focus on output format doesn't aid the task-solving process.
5. It would be beneficial if the prompt is constructed to aid the AI in understanding that the task involves geometry and SVG paths, which could potentially influence its output.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.

Wrong answer: The SVG path represents a (G) pentagon. <answer>(G)</answer>

Correct Label: B 
Model's prediction: G

Reasoning: 
The prompt seems to lead the model to focus on the SVG path instructions linearly, which can make it harder for the model to correctly identify complex shapes. The model has predicted the shape is a pentagon, which suggests that the model is only considering the number of lines drawn and not the complete shape made by the SVG path. In this case, the SVG path actually makes a shape of seven sides, a heptagon. 

Improvements to prompt: 
1. Highlight the importance of considering the entire SVG path as a whole, instead of incrementally or linearly. 
2. Specify that the shape is a closed shape, as this could help to rule out certain options such as lines.
3. Provide guidance on the combinations of lines or curves that form the different geometric shapes that can be options.
4. Ask model to consider how the lines or curves connect to form the corners or vertices of the shape.

Examining the incorrect examples:

<1>
The SVG path provided in this example, although complex, is meant to represent a complex geometric shape. The model correctly identifies this but misinterprets the provided path for a pentagon (G) instead of the correct answer, a heptagon (B). 

Reasons for the error:
1. The prompt might be misleading or too complex for the model because it does not specify how the lines and curves in the path correlate to the geometric shape's edges and vertices. The model may incorrectly interpret curves as sides of the shape.
2. The model may not correctly interpret the "M" and "L" commands in the path data. The "M" command moves the "pen" to a new location, and the "L" command draws a line from the current pen location to a new position. 
3. The prompt is not clear about how the options should be considered. It does not specify if they relate to regular or irregular shapes, which might confuse the model.
4. A possible lack of understanding or incorrect interpretation of SVG path instructions by the model can also contribute to the wrong answer.

Improvements:
1. Clarify how the lines and curves in the SVG path instructions correlate to the geometric shape's edges and vertices. 
2. Specify that the options can include both regular and irregular versions of the shapes.
3. Include an explanation or short guide in the prompt about how to interpret the basic SVG path commands to draw the shape.
4. Specify in the prompt that the drawn shape may not explicitly resemble a perfect geometric figure due to the path details (a perfect circle might look like a heptagon when drawn with many line commands).
5. Make the prompt more specific in acknowledging the number of lines or vertices in the path, which may resemble the number of sides in the geometric figure.
6. Consider asking the model to take into account the number of coordinates provided in an SVG, as this may hint at the number of sides or vertices a shape has.

Wrong Answer: (G) pentagon
Correct Answer: (B) heptagon

Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1. Lack of Explicit Instruction for Calculation: The prompt does not provide explicit instruction on how to interpret the SVG path command and calculate the number of vertices or sides. It just gives a vague hint that the number of coordinates or lines can reflect the number of sides or vertices.

2. Complexity of SVG Path: An SVG path can include not only straight lines, but also curves, which makes it challenging for the model to discern the geometric shape. 

3. Absence of Guidance on Ungrouped "M" Commands: In the given SVG path, there are ungrouped "M" commands which make it hard to discern the number of vertices. 

Improvement Aspects:

1. Explicit Instruction: The prompt should provide explicit information about how to interpret the SVG path commands and calculate the number of vertices or sides.

2. Separate Handling of Curves and Lines: Make it clear to the language model that it needs to process straight lines and curves differently when interpreting the SVG path.

3. Clearer Guidance on "M" Commands: The prompt should elaborate on how to handle SVG path when "M" commands are separated into different parts.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The provided prompt doesn't fulfill the task requirements as it lacks specific guidance on how to interpret "curves" in SVG path instructions. Curves can significantly alter the shape drawn, and if the model isn't explicitly guided to account for them, it might misinterpret the figure. In this case, it doesn't seem to acknowledge the "curves" correctly, leading it to identify the polygon more by the number of line commands rather than by the actual figure the SVG commands produce.

Reason:
- Lack of clear instruction on how to interpret and handle "curves" in SVG path instructions. 

Based on this analysis, the prompt can be improved through different ways, such as specifying handling of curves, adding that the SVG instructions might also use "C" or "Q" commands to draw curves, which can alter the shape beyond the number of "L" or line commands.

2) Additionally, the prompt doesn't explicitly provide enough instruction on handling regular and irregular versions of shapes. Any confusion on the model's part while trying to assess an irregular version of the shape, like in this case, might lead to an incorrect identification.

Reason:
- Lack of detailed explanation on handling irregular shapes apart from mentioning that they might appear.

To improve this aspect, the prompt might need to further explain to the model on how to approach these irregular shapes and making it clear that even though the shape isn't perfect, it can still be classified as a particular figure.

3) Also, the prompt vaguely mentions that the figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the path details, but doesn't specifically guide the model how to handle such situations. This vagueness might lead the model to overthink or overlook some details, leading to misinterpretation like in this case.

Reason:
- Vague instructions on dealing with imperfect figures which do not exactly resemble the geometrical shape.

The prompt could better explain how exactly the model should approach such scenarios. For instance, it might instruct the model to focus more on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections.

To summarize, here are the possible improvements for the prompt:

1) Specify handling of curves in SVG instructions.
2) Provide improved explanation on how to approach irregular shapes.
3) Give clearer instructions on dealing with figures that might not perfectly match the geometric shapes.

gradient:
Example 1 Reasoning:

In this example, the model seems to calculate the number of points or lines incorrectly from the SVG path instructions. The correct shape, according to the instructions, forms a heptagon, but based on the response, it appears that the model counted only five main points or sides.

Another potential issue could be that the model is getting confused by multiple "M" commands in single SVG path instructions. It's possible that the model might be interpreting each set of instructions between "M" commands as separate shapes instead of parts of one shape.

Summary:

1. The model may struggle with interpreting SVG path instructions accurately and determining the number of sides, vertices or points in a geometric figure, which leads to the misidentification of the shape.

2. The model might struggle with understanding how "M" commands in SVG path instructions are used to move the pen to a new location and continue the shape from there.

Improvement Aspects:

1. More clarity or emphasis needs to be added about the interpretation of SVG path instructions, especially the understanding of "M" commands.

2. The model could benefit from additional training on determining the number of sides or vertices in a shape from SVG instructions.

3. The prompt might need to provide clear instructions for handling multiple "M" commands within a single SVG path instruction and continue the shape from a new location without treating it as a separate shape. 

4. The model could also be trained more about both regular and irregular versions of shapes, as these may present differently in SVG instructions.

5. The prompt should stress the importance of going beyond apparent path details to identify not so obvious geometric shapes. Here the model seems to have considered only the prominent points without recognizing the less evident, but integral part of the geometric shape.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(G) pentagon</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: G.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1 Reasoning:

In this example, the model seems to calculate the number of points or lines incorrectly from the SVG path instructions. The correct shape, according to the instructions, forms a heptagon, but based on the response, it appears that the model counted only five main points or sides.

Another potential issue could be that the model is getting confused by multiple "M" commands in single SVG path instructions. It's possible that the model might be interpreting each set of instructions between "M" commands as separate shapes instead of parts of one shape.

Summary:

1. The model may struggle with interpreting SVG path instructions accurately and determining the number of sides, vertices or points in a geometric figure, which leads to the misidentification of the shape.

2. The model might struggle with understanding how "M" commands in SVG path instructions are used to move the pen to a new location and continue the shape from there.

Improvement Aspects:

1. More clarity or emphasis needs to be added about the interpretation of SVG path instructions, especially the understanding of "M" commands.

2. The model could benefit from additional training on determining the number of sides or vertices in a shape from SVG instructions.

3. The prompt might need to provide clear instructions for handling multiple "M" commands within a single SVG path instruction and continue the shape from a new location without treating it as a separate shape. 

4. The model could also be trained more about both regular and irregular versions of shapes, as these may present differently in SVG instructions.

5. The prompt should stress the importance of going beyond apparent path details to identify not so obvious geometric shapes. Here the model seems to have considered only the prominent points without recognizing the less evident, but integral part of the geometric shape.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.

gradient:
<1> 

In this case, the prompt is technically correct in how it asks the model to interpret the SVG path instructions. However, it might have led to the incorrect answer because the model has incorrectly analyzed the path commands; specifically, the number of "L" commands in relation to the number of vertices of the shape. 

Reasons:
1. Lack of Clarity: The instructions represent a complex task that involves understanding SVG path commands and correlating them to geometric shapes. However, it is not explicitly mentioned how to handle disjointed lines represented by separate "M" commands. This can lead to confusion for the model.
2. Ambiguity: The model might not correctly deduce regular and irregular shapes from SVG path instructions. Since it might focus on equal sides and angles to determine a regular shape, it may get confused when it comes to irregular shapes.
3. Misinterpretation: Counting the number of successive "L" commands as edges of the shape is clear, but the model might have trouble identifying the vertices, thus misclassifying the shape.

Prompt Improvement:
1. Separate the task steps: Consider breaking down the task into simpler steps for the model to follow for better understanding.
2. Define Terms: Clearly define the terms used, such as vertices, edges, regular, and irregular shapes, as these may confuse the model.

response:
<START>
You're given a set of SVG path instructions, which are employed to outline a geometric figure. Your task is to determine what geometric shape is created by these commands. Bear in mind that the shape could be either regular (all sides and angles are equal) or irregular (the sides and angles may differ). The SVG path instructions utilize the "M" command to reposition the "pen" and the "L" command to draw a straight line from the current point to a new one. In cases when multiple "M" commands exist in a single instruction, realize it represents disjointed lines in the path. For this exercise, even a curve in the path is considered as a straight line, for simplicity. Each "L" command represents an edge of our geometric shape. Count the number of edges (lines) to deduce the shape. The vertices are to be considered as corners of the shape. Understand, due to the intricacies of the path, the figure might not be an ideal representation of the geometric shape. Choose the option that most accurately outlines the shape formed by the SVG path instructions. Provide your answer by selecting the option letter. Keep the complexity of individual shapes in mind as the path might not form a perfectly regular version. Always select an option that best fits the description given by SVG path instructions. 

Here's an example to illustrate: if we have four "L" commands only, we interpret it as a rectangle or a square, not a triangle nor a circle. The total count of lines (edges) helps determine the figure. If we have an extra "M" command or a disjointed line, consider it as a part of the overall shape, and not a separate entity.

Question: "This SVG path element <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> draws a ..."

Explanation: In this instance, the SVG path instructions appear to be constructing a shape that has seven corners or vertices. However, the language model incorrectly identifies the shape as a pentagon (a five-sided figure), which is option G. 

Possible reasons for the incorrect answer:

- Coincidence of Points: The model may have identified some "M" instructions as ending points, and hence wrongly counted the number of corners to come up with a pentagon.
- Curve Interpretation: Due to the complexity of SVG paths, the curve considered as a line might confuse the model. 
- Issue of Clarity: The prompt does not clarify how to handle disjoint lines.
  
Improvements to the prompt:

- Clearer instructions for disjoint lines: The prompt should state clearly how to interpret disjoint lines in the SVG path.
- Better curve explanation: While treating curves as straight lines is useful for simplicity, it may lead to confusion. There needs to be explicit instruction on how to interpret curves. 
- Detailed Instruction Visualization: Providing some forms of visual aid may help the model better understand SVG instructions, but within text-based limitations of language models this can be complicated.
- More comprehensive examples: The prompt could benefit from examples showing various types of shapes and SVG path instructions, especially for complex cases.

Given the SVG path instructions to draw a geometric figure, your task is to decipher the shape described. Please note that the instructions might represent both regular (with equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. The SVG path instructions use "M" commands to move the "pen" to a new position, and "L" commands to draw a straight line from the current position to another. There might be multiple "M" commands in one instruction; it implies several disjointed lines on the path, but that doesn't change the overall shape. A curve in the path is considered a line for simplicity. Count the number of successive "L" commands as edges of the shape and vertices as corners of the shape. Take note, the figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path. Choose the option that best describes the shape created by the SVG path instructions and provide your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path instructions describe a (G) pentagon. 

<answer>(G)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: G.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1) Example 1:

Question: "This SVG path element <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> draws a ..."

Explanation: In this instance, the SVG path instructions appear to be constructing a shape that has seven corners or vertices. However, the language model incorrectly identifies the shape as a pentagon (a five-sided figure), which is option G. 

Possible reasons for the incorrect answer:

- Coincidence of Points: The model may have identified some "M" instructions as ending points, and hence wrongly counted the number of corners to come up with a pentagon.
- Curve Interpretation: Due to the complexity of SVG paths, the curve considered as a line might confuse the model. 
- Issue of Clarity: The prompt does not clarify how to handle disjoint lines.
  
Improvements to the prompt:

- Clearer instructions for disjoint lines: The prompt should state clearly how to interpret disjoint lines in the SVG path.
- Better curve explanation: While treating curves as straight lines is useful for simplicity, it may lead to confusion. There needs to be explicit instruction on how to interpret curves. 
- Detailed Instruction Visualization: Providing some forms of visual aid may help the model better understand SVG instructions, but within text-based limitations of language models this can be complicated.
- More comprehensive examples: The prompt could benefit from examples showing various types of shapes and SVG path instructions, especially for complex cases.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.
(3) Given the SVG path instructions to draw a geometric figure, your task is to decipher the shape described. Please note that the instructions might represent both regular (with equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. The SVG path instructions use "M" commands to move the "pen" to a new position, and "L" commands to draw a straight line from the current position to another. There might be multiple "M" commands in one instruction; it implies several disjointed lines on the path, but that doesn't change the overall shape.

For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure. The indication may define both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform renditions of shapes. In these SVG path instructions, "M" commands shift the drawing "pen" to an alternative point, whereas "L" commands construct a line segment from the existing position to another. Multiple "M" commands in one instruction suggest disjointed lines within the path, which can influence recognition of the overall shape. Curves are treated as straight lines for simplicity. You should evaluate the number of sequential "L" commands as the sides of the figure and the points as its vertices. Be aware, the figure sketched might not closely adhere to the standard geometric figure due to intricate aspects of the path and possible presence of disjointed lines. Examine the instructions and opt for the choice that best encapsulates the figure created by the SVG path instructions. Declare your answer by stating the designated letter of the selected option.

Remember, each "L" command signifies a straight line forming an edge of the shape, regardless of whether it connects back to the starting point or forms a free-standing line. In consideration of the potential complexity of SVG paths elements, don't be distracted by the disjointed lines; they don't affect the final geometric shape. Prioritize overall structure over minute details.

Now, interpret the SVG path instructions provided and choose a corresponding option: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle.

Wrong Answer: The SVG path instructions describe a (G) pentagon. <answer>(G)</answer>

Reason: The SVG path instruction suggests a seven-sided geometric figure (heptagon) is being drawn with seven "L" commands being used. However, the response of the model is a five-sided figure (pentagon). The confusion likely arose from the model’s lack of understanding of the process of counting vertices and edges from SVG path instructions. It may have considered multiple "M" commands as indications to reset the edge count, which is not the case.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Clarify and emphasize the correlation of SVG "L" commands with the edges of a geometric figure - reminding that every "L" command relates to an edge, and the count of "L" commands signifies the shape.
   
2. Reinforce that multiple "M" commands in a single path do not affect the overall shape or change the original edge count.

3. Include examples of SVG path instructions and the corresponding geometric shape identification in the prompt to provide better context for the model.

4. Provide additional explanation that the model should count the number of "L" commands to identify the shape rather than interpreting the SVG path instructions subjectively.

5. The model may benefit from a more clear explanation of how to count edges and vertices in the SVG path and how these relate to identifying the correct geometric figure.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure. The indication may define both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform renditions of shapes. In these SVG path instructions, "M" commands shift the drawing "pen" to an alternative point, whereas "L" commands construct a line segment from the existing position to another. Multiple "M" commands in one instruction suggest disjointed lines within the path, which can influence recognition of the overall shape. Curves are treated as straight lines for simplicity. You should evaluate the number of sequential "L" commands as the sides of the figure and the points as its vertices. Be aware, the figure sketched might not closely adhere to the standard geometric figure due to intricate aspects of the path and possible presence of disjointed lines. Examine the instructions and opt for the choice that best encapsulates the figure created by the SVG path instructions. Declare your answer by stating the designated letter of the selected option.

gradient:
<1>
Analysis:
The prompt asks the model to identify a geometric figure based on SVG path instructions. It seems the model incorrectly identified the shape as a kite, while the correct answer was expected to be a heptagon. This happened because the model might have misinterpreted the total number of "L" commands as sides of the figure, and the complex figures with multiple M commands leading to disjointed lines threw it off.

Reasons:
- Lack of Data: The model might have needed more examples of SVG path instructions leading to different geometric shapes. More examples may provide a better understanding of how to decode SVG path instructions.
- Misinterpretation: The model might have misinterpreted the instructions in the SVG path. The multiple "M" commands indicating disjointed lines within the path could have made it difficult for the model to properly recognize the shape.
- Over-simplification: The model treated curves as straight lines, as specified in the prompt, but this may have led to misinterpretation in complex SVG paths.

Improvement Aspects:
- Provide Clearer Instructions: Enhance the prompt to provide a more detailed explanation on handling multiple "M" commands and how to consider them while identifying shapes.
- Include Examples: Adding a few example SVG path instructions corresponding to specific shapes in the prompt would be more instructive for the model.
- Handle Disjointed Lines: Instruction should be provided on if and how to consider disjointed lines formed by multiple "M" commands.
- Revise Evaluation Method: It would make the task clearer if the prompt specified that the number of "L" commands doesn't always correspond to the number of edges the figure has due to the presence of complex paths and disjointed lines.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.
(3) Given the SVG path instructions to draw a geometric figure, your task is to decipher the shape described. Please note that the instructions might represent both regular (with equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. The SVG path instructions use "M" commands to move the "pen" to a new position, and "L" commands to draw a straight line from the current position to another. There might be multiple "M" commands in one instruction; it implies several disjointed lines on the path, but that doesn't change the overall shape. A curve in the path is considered a line for simplicity. Count the number of successive "L" commands as edges of the shape and vertices as corners of the shape. Take note, the figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path. Choose the option that best describes the shape created by the SVG path instructions and provide your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.
(4) For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure. The indication may define both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform renditions of shapes.

response:
<START> 

In this task, you will decode SVG path instructions to identify a geometric figure. The instructions may draw both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform shapes. A SVG path instruction begins with "M" commands that shift the drawing "pen" to an initial point, and "L" commands thereafter construct a line segment from the existing point to a new one. Remember, every "L" command signifies a straight line that forms an edge of a shape. If multiple "M" commands exist in one instruction, it suggests that there are disjointed lines within the path, but these disjointed lines do not affect the overall shape of the figure, instead they might indicate complexities within the shape. Also, curves are considered as straight lines for simplicity.

A key point to consider is that the quantity of sequential "L" commands does not always correspond to the sides of the figure due to complex path structures or existence of disjointed lines. Therefore, look at the SVG path instructions holistically and choose the option that best describes the entire figure sketched. Although the shape might not strictly adhere to a standard geometric figure because of intricate aspects of the path, your objective is to identify the general structure rather than focusing on minute details.

Now, with the given SVG path instructions, what geometric figure does it most resemble: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle? Present your answer as: <answer>(Your Chosen Option)</answer>.

Please note that, one SVG path instruction example is as follows, "M X1,Y1 L X2,Y2 L X3,Y3", where X and Y are coordinates. Here, "M X1,Y1" moves the pen to point (X1,Y1), and "L X2,Y2" and "L X3,Y3" draw straight lines from the end of the previous line to points (X2,Y2) and (X3,Y3) respectively.

gradient:
<1>
The model's input is: 
For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure...

Reason:
From the model's prompt and response, it's apparent that the language model does not have the capability to visually perceive and interpret SVG path instructions to decode the geometric figure it sketches. SVG path interpretation to deduce the figure it represents, necessitates visual perception or intricate line-by-line (or even point-by-point) analysis, which a mere natural language understanding and generation model like GPT-3 is not designed for. 

Improvements: 
This kind of task description is a mismatch for this model's abilities. Language models like GPT-3 don't actually interpret graphical code; they intuit based on patterns in questions and answers they've seen previously. Thus, the failing here isn't with the prompt per se, but the task which goes beyond the scope of the model’s design. 
If one wants to stick with a similar task, the better use case would be to generate SVG code based on a verbal description of a geometric visual presentation using specific shapes, path properties, colors, etc. Another alternate task could involve explaining what SVG commands like "M" and "L" do in simple, layman terms. These are much more in the realm of what GPT-3 can handle; going from text to text rather than code to visual interpretation.

Prompt refining aspects:
1. Task compatibility with model's design.
2. Replace geometric interpretation of SVG path instructions with SVG path instruction generation or explain SVG commands.
3. Ensure task falls within the model's scope of understanding and generating text.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
The model's input is: 
For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure...

Reason:
From the model's prompt and response, it's apparent that the language model does not have the capability to visually perceive and interpret SVG path instructions to decode the geometric figure it sketches. SVG path interpretation to deduce the figure it represents, necessitates visual perception or intricate line-by-line (or even point-by-point) analysis, which a mere natural language understanding and generation model like GPT-3 is not designed for. 

Improvements: 
This kind of task description is a mismatch for this model's abilities. Language models like GPT-3 don't actually interpret graphical code; they intuit based on patterns in questions and answers they've seen previously. Thus, the failing here isn't with the prompt per se, but the task which goes beyond the scope of the model’s design. 
If one wants to stick with a similar task, the better use case would be to generate SVG code based on a verbal description of a geometric visual presentation using specific shapes, path properties, colors, etc. Another alternate task could involve explaining what SVG commands like "M" and "L" do in simple, layman terms. These are much more in the realm of what GPT-3 can handle; going from text to text rather than code to visual interpretation.

Prompt refining aspects:
1. Task compatibility with model's design.
2. Replace geometric interpretation of SVG path instructions with SVG path instruction generation or explain SVG commands.
3. Ensure task falls within the model's scope of understanding and generating text.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.
(3) Given the SVG path instructions to draw a geometric figure, your task is to decipher the shape described. Please note that the instructions might represent both regular (with equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. The SVG path instructions use "M" commands to move the "pen" to a new position, and "L" commands to draw a straight line from the current position to another. There might be multiple "M" commands in one instruction; it implies several disjointed lines on the path, but that doesn't change the overall shape. A curve in the path is considered a line for simplicity. Count the number of successive "L" commands as edges of the shape and vertices as corners of the shape. Take note, the figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path. Choose the option that best describes the shape created by the SVG path instructions and provide your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.

gradient:
For the given wrong example, there could be various aspects that led to the incorrect prediction:

1. Lack of SVG path interpretation guidelines: The prompt provides effective steps and general instructions to guide the model on SVG path interpretation, but it doesn't provide clear guidance on what a certain number of displayed "L" commands in a SVG path would mean. If the model had a clear understanding that five "L" commands imply a five-sided figure i.e., a pentagon, for instance, the prediction could have been correct.

2. Absence of Training examples: If the model is not trained with proper examples showing how the various SVG path instructions correspond to actual geometric figures, it might be difficult for the model to obtain the necessary understanding for accurately determining the figure being represented.

3. Unclear Command and Figure Association: Through multiple "L" commands, the model might have noted various lines, but might not have linked these lines to form a meaningful geometric figure. The prompt could emphasize more on using a certain pattern to link together these lines.

4. Simplification of Paths: The prompt instructs the model not to take into account the disjointed elements of the SVG path, but this might lead to disregard for important details that could change the interpretation.

5. Considering free-standing lines: The prompt states that regardless of whether an "L" command connects back to the starting point or forms a free-standing line, it will signify an edge of the shape. This could lead to misinterpretations as the model could consider free-standing lines while determining the final shape.

Improvements for the prompt could be:

1. Providing detailed interpretations for SVG path commands.
2. Giving examples with corresponding geometric shapes.
3. Clearly stating the relationship between the number of L commands and the sides/edges of the corresponding figure.
4. Clarifying the impact of disjointed and free-standing lines or components on determining the final geometric figure.
5. Adding more specific rules or guidelines about SVG path elements interpretation.

response:
<START> In this task, you are required to analyze SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) path instructions to recognize the rendered geometric figure. SVG path instructions use specific commands such as "M", which moves the drawing "pen" to a different location, and "L", which forms a line segment from the current location to the cited one. Sometimes, numerous "M" commands can indicate disjointed lines within the SVG path, but these should not change your evaluation of the primary shape. Interpret curves as straight lines for simplicity.

Count the sequential "L" commands, as each represents a straight line that forms an edge of the shape. The total count of "L" commands corresponds to the sides of the geometric figure. But bear in mind, whether it connects back to the starting point or appears as a free-standing line does not alter its role as a side. However, consider only those free-standing lines that affect the overall shape and ignore the auxiliary ones.

cur_prompt: Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections.

Analysis: 
1. Non-specific instructions: One of the potential reasons that the AI model got this example wrong is the lack of specific instructions for interpreting SVG path commands. It might not have the capabilities to properly interpret 'M,' 'L,' 'C,' and 'Q' SVG commands and identify the proper geometric figure.
2. Complexity of SVG: SVG paths can represent very complex shapes, and understanding them requires a robust understanding of geometry which the model might lack.
3. Focus on curves: The original prompt emphasized curves quite heavily, which could mislead the model if the path is largely composed of lines. This confusion might be the reason the program guessed the figure to be a pentagon, as it's not entirely impossible to form a pentagon shape with curved rather than straight segments.

Ways to Improve Prompt:
1. Explicit information: Explicitly state how to interpret 'M', 'L', 'C', 'Q' instructions in the SVG path to form a geometric figure, if possible.
2. More examples: The prompt could be improved with example SVG paths and how they form specific geometric figures.

<1> 
For this example, the model's prompt is giving general instructions to identify a geometric figure from SVG path instructions. However, this seems too broad and not specifically catered to evaluate an AI model's ability to understand SVG path language. It doesn't explicitly ask the model to ‘parse’ or interpret the SVG instructions in a way that leads to identification of the shape. As a result, the model incorrectly guesses a pentagon, instead of the actual shape, a heptagon.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: 

The model might have misinterpreted the amount of directions or significant "L" and "M" commands. It is also possible that the way the model processes "C" and "Q" commands (curves) is incorrect, leading to a miscount of sides. 

To improve this prompt, consider the following aspects:

1. Make it explicit that the model needs to interpret SVG path instructions, ensuring it understands "M", "L", "C", and "Q" commands and the shapes they can form.

2. Ask the model to consider the number of significant direction changes or 'corners' to identify the shape. 

3. When referring to imperfections, specify that the model should infer the 'general' shape rather than focusing on minor details.

4. Indicate that the SVG path language corresponds to two-dimensional shapes, clarifying possible confusion about three-dimensional shapes.

5. Include in the prompt that the model should consider the total count of commands to determine the number of sides in the geometric figure. 

6. Mention in the prompt that irregular versions of a shape should be classified as the 'closest matching' regular geometric figure. 

7. Perhaps include a mini-dictionary of SVG path commands and their meanings or the actions they perform in the prompt. 

Overall, the prompt should lead the model to 'visually perceive' or interpret the SVG path instructions, count the significant directional changes to determine the number of sides, and assign the closest geometric figure accordingly.

For this example, the model's prompt is giving general instructions to identify a geometric figure from SVG path instructions. However, this seems too broad and not specifically catered to evaluate an AI model's ability to understand SVG path language. It doesn't explicitly ask the model to ‘parse’ or interpret the SVG instructions in a way that leads to identification of the shape. As a result, the model incorrectly guesses a pentagon, instead of the actual shape, a heptagon.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: 

The model might have misinterpreted the amount of directions or significant "L" and "M" commands. It is also possible that the way the model processes "C" and "Q" commands (curves) is incorrect, leading to a miscount of sides. 

To improve this prompt, consider the following aspects:

1. Make it explicit that the model needs to interpret SVG path instructions, ensuring it understands "M", "L", "C", and "Q" commands and the shapes they can form.

2. Ask the model to consider the number of significant direction changes or 'corners' to identify the shape. 

3. When referring to imperfections, specify that the model should infer the 'general' shape rather than focusing on minor details.

4. Indicate that the SVG path language corresponds to two-dimensional shapes, clarifying possible confusion about three-dimensional shapes.

5. Include in the prompt that the model should consider the total count of commands to determine the number of sides in the geometric figure. 

6. Mention in the prompt that irregular versions of a shape should be classified as the 'closest matching' regular geometric figure. 

7. Perhaps include a mini-dictionary of SVG path commands and their meanings or the actions they perform in the prompt. 

Overall, the prompt should lead the model to 'visually perceive' or interpret the SVG path instructions, count the significant directional changes to determine the number of sides, and assign the closest geometric figure accordingly.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.
(3) Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections. With all this information, choose the option that best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions. Give your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.

Model's Response: The SVG path instructions result in a (G) pentagon.
<answer>(G)</answer>

Correct Label: B
Model's Prediction: G

Reason for Wrong Answer:
a. The prompt is not clear about how the model should handle splits in the path (when a new "M" command is introduced part-way through). This could lead to confusion about the number of distinct corners.
b. The prompt mentions taking into account the number of curves but does not clearly define how curves impact the identification of the geometric figure.
c. The instructions about considering irregular versions of shapes may be too vague or confusing for the model.

Improvements for the Prompt:
a. Clearer instructions about how to treat individual path components when multiple "M" commands are present.
b. Provide more concrete rules for how to take 'curves' into account when determining the geometric figure.
c. Give clear instructions about how to consider irregular shapes or make reasonable assumptions when the figure doesn't perfectly resemble any typical geometric figure. Maybe examples could be used to illustrate such scenarios.
d. Specifically state that the model should examine the SVG path instructions to determine the number of corners, which would represent the sides of the resulting geometric figure.

In summary, the prompt could be improved by providing clearer, more explicit instructions for handling path splitting, curves, and irregular shapes. Using examples and scenarios to illustrate these situations could help guide the model's understanding and interpretation.

These instructions may include splines and straight lines, which could form regular or irregular versions of various geometric shapes. The command "M" is a move to a new position while "L" instructs a line to be drawn from the current position to a new one. Likewise, the path may involve "C" or "Q" commands for drawing curves which can significantly alter the resulting figure. While accounting for these curves, if the shape seems to be irregular or doesn't perfectly resemble the typical geometric shape due to the intricacies of the path, determine the closest geometric figure by focusing on the significant lines and curves. Pay attention to the number of corners which typically represents the number of sides in the figure. Consider irregular figures to be the closest matching regular geometric shapes, and bear in mind that this task is on two-dimensional shapes. Now, using your comprehension of these SVG path instructions decode the geometric figure. Respond by selecting the letter option that best describes the figure formed according to the given SVG path instructions.

Model's Response: The SVG path instructions result in a (G) pentagon.
<answer>(G)</answer>

Correct Label: B
Model's Prediction: G

Reason for Wrong Answer:
a. The prompt is not clear about how the model should handle splits in the path (when a new "M" command is introduced part-way through). This could lead to confusion about the number of distinct corners.
b. The prompt mentions taking into account the number of curves but does not clearly define how curves impact the identification of the geometric figure.
c. The instructions about considering irregular versions of shapes may be too vague or confusing for the model.

Improvements for the Prompt:
a. Clearer instructions about how to treat individual path components when multiple "M" commands are present.
b. Provide more concrete rules for how to take 'curves' into account when determining the geometric figure.
c. Give clear instructions about how to consider irregular shapes or make reasonable assumptions when the figure doesn't perfectly resemble any typical geometric figure. Maybe examples could be used to illustrate such scenarios.
d. Specifically state that the model should examine the SVG path instructions to determine the number of corners, which would represent the sides of the resulting geometric figure.

In summary, the prompt could be improved by providing clearer, more explicit instructions for handling path splitting, curves, and irregular shapes. Using examples and scenarios to illustrate these situations could help guide the model's understanding and interpretation.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.
(3) Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections. With all this information, choose the option that best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions. Give your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.
(4) Given instructions in SVG path language, in which geometric figure they result in is to be identified. These instructions may include splines and straight lines, which could form regular or irregular versions of various geometric shapes. The command "M" is a move to a new position while "L" instructs a line to be drawn from the current position to a new one. Likewise, the path may involve "C" or "Q" commands for drawing curves which can significantly alter the resulting figure. While accounting for these curves, if the shape seems to be irregular or doesn't perfectly resemble the typical geometric shape due to the intricacies of the path, determine the closest geometric figure by focusing on the significant lines and curves. Pay attention to the number of corners which typically represents the number of sides in the figure. Consider irregular figures to be the closest matching regular geometric shapes, and bear in mind that this task is on two-dimensional shapes. Now, using your comprehension of these SVG path instructions decode the geometric figure. Respond by selecting the letter option that best describes the figure formed according to the given SVG path instructions.

gradient:
<1> 

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
1. SVG Path Complexity: The complexity of the provided SVG path also seems to be a challenge. The model would need a relatively deep understanding of the SVG path commands, and their interpretation into a two-dimensional geometric shape, which it currently seems not to possess.
2. Geometric Shape Understanding: The model may not inherently understand concepts of geometry such as sides, corners, angles and so forth, which are crucial for identifying two-dimensional shapes.
3. Irregular Shapes: The prompt asks the model to consider irregular figures and match them to the closest regular geometric shapes. This can be ambiguous and lead to incorrect interpretations. For instance, an irregular hexagon can be misinterpreted as a pentagon if one of the angles is not sharply defined.
4. Incomplete Instruction: The prompt gives the model a good understanding of M and L commands but doesn't provide a clear understanding of 'C' and 'Q' commands for drawing curves.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:
1. Simplify the Task: Recognizing shapes via SVG paths may be a tall order. Instead, maybe provide a simpler task that is more suitable for its current abilities.
2. Illustrate Commands: When explaining the different SVG path commands in the prompt, consider adding examples to illustrate how they work.
3. Specify Rules: If the model should match irregular shapes to a regular figure, define more specific rules for this process to manage ambiguity.
4. Improve Understanding: You might include more basic explanations of what different shapes consist of – the number of sides, the number of corners, angles, and so forth, to empower the model to more readily distinguish between different shapes.
5. Complete Instruction Explanation: Explain in more detail what 'C' and 'Q' commands in SVG path language entail and how they alter the final geometric figure.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path instructions provided draw a kite. Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(D) kite</answer>

Reasons:

1. The prompt may not adequately emphasize how to interpret the SVG language: SVG path language is a complex vector graphics language that requires deep understanding to translate it into a geometric shape. The model may not be capable of correctly interpreting and visualizing it based on the given instructions.

2. The difficulty in correctly differentiating between regular and irregular geometric figures: The language model may struggle to identify shape since the figure slightly deviates from the regular geometric figure due to intricacies of the path. In this case, the model chose a kite instead of a heptagon, likely misinterpreting the lines and curves.

3. The language model does not have sufficient guidance on how to handle curves ("C" or "Q" commands) that can significantly alter the resulting figure. This could affect the model's understanding and interpretation of the geometric shape.

4. The lack of specific instructions on how to handle multiple "M" (move to) commands in the SVG path, which could signify the start of new sub-paths or discontinuous sections, potentially altering the final geometric shape.

Improvements:

1. Along with explaining SVG commands, their geometrical implications should be explained better in the prompt, such as how the "M" command can represent a new sub-path, or curves can change the interpretation of the sides of a shape.

2. The model may benefit from more explicit instructions to account for irregularities in geometric figures and guidance on how to identify close approximations to standard geometric forms.

3. The prompt might be improved by offering detailed parse examples of SVG paths to shapes.

4. More emphasis could be put on the interpretation of the number of 'corners' or 'vertices' in the figure derived from the SVG path description.

5. It may help to clarify what criteria the model should utilize in assigning a shape to an SVG path that could conceivably correspond to more than one shape.

Given instructions in SVG path language, in which geometric figure they result in is to be identified.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.
(3) Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections. With all this information, choose the option that best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions. Give your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.
(4) Given instructions in SVG path language, in which geometric figure they result in is to be identified.

response:
<START> SVG path language provides instructions to create complex geometric figures using various commands. Each figure consists of an array of elements, including lines signified by "M" and "L", as well as curves indicated by "C" or "Q". The aim is to analyze these SVG path instructions and identify the resulting geometric figure. For clarity, the "M" command instructs a move to a new position to start drawing, and the "L" command designates a line to be drawn from the present position to a new one. When it comes to "C" or "Q", they denote the drawing of curves, hence the shape might have curves which greatly influence the overall form of the figure. In interpreting these lines and curves, take note that the figure formed may not strictly adhere to a conventional geometric shape due to the complexity of the SVG path, but a close approximation will suffice. Prioritize the substantial lines and curves, and observe the count of corners to get an insight into the number of sides or vertices of the shape. Also, consider an irregular figure to represent the closest common geometric figure based on its significant characteristics. This task focuses on two-dimensional geometric figures, so apply your learned understanding of these SVG path instructions to identify the closest geometric figure they represent.

Analysis: It seems the error came from the language model not being able to interpret SVG paths to identify the shape, which is understandable since SVG paths are visual data requiring interpretation, which is outside of the model's capabilities. 

The prompt asks the model to focus on recognizing patterns and understanding context rather than interpreting SVG paths. However, in this question, the model is required to interpret an SVG path, which contradicts the provided instructions, thereby causing confusion and resulting in the wrong answer.

In the prompt, abstract descriptions of geometric shapes were discussed, including lines, curves, and angles, but the content posed in the question involves a concrete SVG path. The model is not designed to translate from such coding language into geometric shapes.

Improvements:
1. Make explicit which kind of descriptions are permissible in the task. Clarify that the descriptions should be given in ordinary language, not SVG paths or similar formats.
2. Emphasize in the prompt that the task is based on verbal descriptions and understanding of geometric shapes and not their coded or visual representations. This will prevent ambiguity in complex scenarios like the question posed.
3. Avoid over-generalization (‘any description’) in the prompt, as it does not give a clear direction of what format or level of description the language model should be prepared to handle.
4. Specify the model's limitations more clearly to manage the expectations of users.
5. Adjust the task to correctly interpret more complex information, if SVG path description understanding is necessary for the task. This would, however, entail re-training the model with a more sophisticated language model structure.

Given a description of a geometric shape, identify the most appropriate shape from the list of options.

This task involves recognizing patterns and understanding context, rather than interpreting SVG paths.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The description provided draws a kite. 
Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Wrong example analysis:

The inputs asking the model to consider shapes based purely on descriptions of lines, curves, angles, and context can be a significant difficulty. SVG paths are mathematical descriptions of shapes, which the AI model needs to understand and translate into concepts of shapes it's learned.

In the wrong example, it seems that the model misinterprets the SVG paths and concludes that the shape is a kite (D), while the correct answer is a heptagon (B). However, the prompt explicitly states that "This task involves recognizing patterns and understanding context, rather than interpreting SVG paths." Because the model isn't asked to recognize the SVG paths, it gets confused and chooses the wrong shape.

Reasons for incorrect answer:

- Limited understanding of SVG paths: The model seems to lack data understanding and translating SVG path code into geometric shapes.
- The contradiction in the prompt: Despite the claim that the task involves recognizing patterns and understanding context rather than interpreting SVG paths, the prompt presents the model with an SVG path to interpret.

Prompt Improvement:

Based on the reasons above, the following changes can be made to improve the prompt:

1. Clarity: Communicate clearly that the model should be capable of translating the SVG path data into shapes it has learned.
2. Relevance: Ensure that the information given in the prompt is relevant to the task at hand. The mention of 'recognizing patterns and understanding context' might mislead the model when the task is actually about recognizing shapes from SVG paths. 
3. Training: If possible, the AI model could be trained further to understand SVG path data and respond more accurately to these kinds of prompts.
4. Explicit Instructions: Clearly explain the details so that there is no ambiguity in understanding the presented task. The current prompt assumes that the model can understand the SVG paths when in reality it is not built to interpret these paths.
5. Conciseness: Ensure that the prompt is as straight to the point as possible. Extra information can lead to the model making mistakes when it's not sure what the task is asking for. 

A revised version of the prompt could look like this:

"Given the SVG path of a geometric shape, identify the most appropriate shape from the provided list. The challenge here is recognizing the geometric shape that is being represented in the SVG path code, ranging from its lines, curves, angles, and other features. Here's the SVG path code:"

Such a prompt orientations the model to focus on interpreting the SVG paths rather than context or patterns.

1. Wrong Example Analysis:

For the first example, the model failed to understand that it must not interpret SVG paths. The SVG path element provided is a graphical code, and it is understood that the AI model is not designed to decode, visualize or interpret it. However, it seems the model tried to interpret the SVG path and ended up predicting the shape as a 'kite', which is incorrect. The confusion might have arisen from the mention of SVG paths not meant to be interpreted by the model. Even though the instructions say not to interpret the path, the path is given as an input. Thus, the model may have perceived the SVG path data as relevant input material.

Reasons for wrong answers:

1. Misunderstanding of SVG Path Input: Despite the instruction clearly indicating that SVG path should not be interpreted, the model nonetheless attempted to do so. This likely occurred because the SVG path was provided as input, leading the model to perceive it as necessary information.

2. Task Mismatch: The AI model is designed for understanding geometric shapes described through features like angles, lines, curves, etc., rather than decoding graphical code. 

3. Lack of Clear Instructions: The instructions, while attempting to be clear, ended up conveying two contradictory points – one is not to interpret the SVG path, while subsequently providing an SVG path to the model.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarity of Instructions: The instructions need to be clearer, possibly eliminating the contradictory elements. It would be beneficial not to include SVG path unless the model is required to interpolate it. If the SVG path isn't meant to be interpreted, it should not be included in the input.

2. Separation of Task and Note: To avoid confusion, it could be better to clearly separate the task/direction for the model from the auxiliary notes or extra information about the task.

3. Restructure the Instructions: To ensure the model does not attempt to interpret the SVG path, place this caution note in the beginning rather than at the end. For example, "Do not interpret the SVG paths. Given a description of a geometric shape..."

4. Emphasize on Geometric Features: The prompts should stress more on identifying the shape from the details about lines, curves, angles, and other specific features.

5. Provide the Correct Form of Input: Ensure the input provided is appropriate for the AI model's capabilities, i.e., descriptions of shapes and their characteristic features rather than encoded graphics data like SVG paths. The input should align with the model's functionality and the task it's designed to perform.

The question involves interpretation of the SVG path data which in turn requires a specific level of visual encoding skills. The model may not have the capability of 'visualizing' the SVG path to identify the pattern it forms. As a result, the model makes incorrect predictions.

The model's response suggests it incorrectly interpreted the path as a triangle, instead of a heptagon. This is likely because the model may not have adequate knowledge to map such SVG data into respective geometric representations. It's also possible that the complexity of the SVG path data exceeded the model's comprehension capabilities.

A few problems from the prompt may lead to the wrong answers:

- It may require the model to apply visualization skills which it might currently lack.
- Misinterpretation of the SVG path as a geometric shape by the model itself.
- Lack of understanding by the model of SVG paths associated with each shape. 
- Overgeneralization of certain shapes or a bias towards simpler shapes like a line or triangle.

To improve the prompt:

- Clarify that the task involves understanding SVG path data, which the current prompt doesn't adequately focus on.
- Make it explicit that the task is not about identifying the 'common' shape but is about mapping SVG path data to a specific shape.
- Add instructions to check all lines, curves, angles, and geometric features including intersecting lines and angles greater or smaller than 90 degrees.
- Define explicitly what each shape's SVG path data might look like, or provide examples for better understanding.
- Instruct the model to evaluate all options carefully to eliminate less probable options.

Wrong Answer: 
The SVG path data represents a triangle. 
Therefore, the correct answer is: <answer>(J) triangle</answer>

Correct Answer: B

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. The model might not be able to correctly interpret and visualize SVG path data as it's a complex task that often requires a combination of computational geometry and human intuition.

2. SVG path interpretation is not a task that language models are usually trained on, which might have caused the engine to simply guess rather than make an informed prediction.

3. The prompt doesn't provide clear instructions on how to decode the SVG path data into a geometric shape. 

4. The model might have considered the largest movements to form a triangle and ignored smaller movements in the path data.

5. The prompt might be demanding a high level of abstraction from the model which it is not capable of due to the nature of its training and limitations in understanding visual or spatial information.

6. It's likely the model doesn't understand or decode SVG path data, and it's looking for keywords in the problem that hint at the answer, such as 'triangle'.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Provide the model with clear and step-by-step instructions on how to analyze and interpret SVG path data.

2. Include examples with a correct interpretation of SVG path data to guide the model.

3. Simplify the task if possible, SVG path interpretation may be too complex for the current capabilities of AI models.

4. Gradually introduce complex elements in the prompt to make sure the model understands each part before moving to a higher level of abstraction.

5. Experiment with breaking down the SVG path data into smaller chunks and see if the model can handle the interpretation better. 

6. Frame the task in a way that matches the model's training, to leverage its abilities in pattern recognition, correlation detection, and context inference.

Example 1: 

Question: 
The task requested the model to determine what geometric shape is represented by the given SVG path data. The options were a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, and triangle. 

Wrong Answer: 
The model determined that the SVG path data represented a triangle. 

Analysis: 
The language model got confused by the fairly complex task. It's challenging for a language model to accurately interpret SVG path data into a physical shape because it requires the understanding of the SVG path syntax (the "d" property), which contains sets of commands followed by parameters for a path to be constructed. This is a highly technical task beyond typical language understanding or text comprehension. It's less related to the meaning of language, and more about being able to parse and interpret specific SVG path data.

Possible Improvements:
Given the complex nature of the task, the following improvements could be made:

1. Reframe the prompt to abstract the SVG path interpretation: You could ask the model to analyze a simplified description of a drawn shape rather than the SVG path data itself. This would turn the task into more of a language understanding and reasoning task, which is what language models like GPT-3 excel at.
   
2. Use a visual-based instead of language-based model: Actually interpreting SVG paths into geometric shapes is better suited to a computer vision or graphic model rather than a language model. Switching to a model that's designed for such tasks would likely yield better results. 

3. Increase the correctness criteria: It is important to specify that the task requires technical proficiency in understanding SVG paths, not interpreting language context. This way, the model will likely take a more syntactic approach to decode the shapes. 

4. Educate the model on SVG Paths: If the use of a language model is critical, consider using SVG Path-specific training data to better equip the model to perform such tasks.

The question provides SVG path data, but there's no way the model can interpret it directly. AI language models analyze text and can't handle image or vector data in the same way they handle text. Therefore, the prompt can't reliably lead the model to deduce the correct geometric shape from SVG path data.

In the wrong response, the model is essentially guessing the answer, seemingly at random, and decides to classify the SVG path data as a "kite" shape, while the correct answer is "heptagon". This demonstrates that the model has no real ability to process or understand SVG path data; it's not analyzing the text in a way that would allow it to correctly identify the geometric shape the data represents.

Aspects that could improve the prompt: 

1. Since AI language models are currently unable to interpret SVG paths, removing references to examining SVG path data could improve the prompt's usability and focus.
2. The new task could state more explicitly that the model must make judgments based on textual description or it must generate descriptions of a given geometric shape.
3. Potential answers could be presented not as a list, but rather with sufficient textual description to allow correct identification. 
4. In the case of teaching the model about SVG paths or geometry, using an approach with simpler steps where the model makes judgments based on clear textual cues could be more beneficial.
5. The model needs to be reminded that it's dealing with a multiple-choice question, and it must choose the most appropriate answer from the given options. In the current prompt, the model might miss the instruction to choose from the "given list of options". 
6. The distinction between identifying properties of the geometric shape (such as lines, curves, angles, etc.) and the specific shape name should be clarified. The undo complexity caused by introducing these additional properties can be eliminated.

In this case, the model's interpretation of the SVG path data was incorrect and resulted in the selection of the wrong geometrical shape. The prompt asked the model to decode SVG path data and determine the geometrical shape that it represents. From the path data, the shape presented is a heptagon (option B), but the model incorrectly predicted this as a pentagon (option G).

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of SVG Path Data: The model might have had difficulty fully understanding and decoding the SVG path data provided and therefore incorrectly identified it as a pentagon instead of a heptagon. It might have miscounted the number of lines or angles in the shape.

2. Inadequate Understanding of Geometric Shapes: The model may possess an insufficient understanding of geometric shapes, leading to the wrong selection. 

To improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize the Importance of Analyzing SVG Path Data: The prompt should emphasize the need to painstakingly count the number of lines, curves, and angles in the SVG path data, as these are critical aspects of identifying the shape.

2. Clarify the Characteristics of Geometric Shapes: It can be helpful to clarify that different geometric shapes have a distinct number of sides, angles, and other defining characteristics. This can aid in improving the model's understanding and identification of shapes.

Question Analysis: The model is tasked to denote the geometric shape corresponding to a certain set of SVG path data. The given SVG path points describe a structure with seven connecting points, which portrays a heptagon. However, this requires the capability to interpret and display SVG paths to properly identify such complex configurations.

Model's Incorrect Response: The model wrongly identified the shape as a kite. It is not clear how the model arrived at this conclusion since the SVG input does not correspond to the characteristics of said shape. The AI model may not be capable of understanding SVG path data as the input isn't something that can be textually analysed, but requires an interpretative diagram or a coding system that inherently understands SVG formatting. 

Point 1: Lack of Clarity - While prompting, the model might have been confused amidst mentioning various possibilities that might arise like intersecting lines, curves, and other complex configurations, resulting in the wrong answer. 

Point 2: Complexity in SVG path - Understanding SVG path is deeply mathematical. Language models like this are trained to understand human language and do simple arithmetic. The complexity and the abstraction involved in SVG path require human expertise in coding and understanding geometrical shapes.

Point 3: Lack of Feature Estimation - SVG path data gives the direction and points where a path moves to. This path can form various complex shapes including non-geometric ones, which the model did not consider while interpreting.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Given a set of SVG path data representing a geometric shape, your task is to determine the correct shape it corresponds to. This will involve decoding the SVG path data and identifying features such as lines, curves, angles, and other elements that comprise the geometric shape. Note that the shape might not be of the traditional variety and may be complex with intersecting lines or curves; angles that might be greater or less than 90 degrees; or multiple curves and lines. Familiarize yourself with the characteristics of the SVG path data for each shape. On interpreting the SVG path data, select the appropriate shape from the given list of options. Be sure to evaluate all provided options carefully before pinpointing the geometric shape the SVG path data illustrates.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path data provided represents a kite shape. 
Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

Question Analysis: The model is tasked to denote the geometric shape corresponding to a certain set of SVG path data. The given SVG path points describe a structure with seven connecting points, which portrays a heptagon. However, this requires the capability to interpret and display SVG paths to properly identify such complex configurations.

Model's Incorrect Response: The model wrongly identified the shape as a kite. It is not clear how the model arrived at this conclusion since the SVG input does not correspond to the characteristics of said shape. The AI model may not be capable of understanding SVG path data as the input isn't something that can be textually analysed, but requires an interpretative diagram or a coding system that inherently understands SVG formatting. 

Point 1: Lack of Clarity - While prompting, the model might have been confused amidst mentioning various possibilities that might arise like intersecting lines, curves, and other complex configurations, resulting in the wrong answer. 

Point 2: Complexity in SVG path - Understanding SVG path is deeply mathematical. Language models like this are trained to understand human language and do simple arithmetic. The complexity and the abstraction involved in SVG path require human expertise in coding and understanding geometrical shapes.

Point 3: Lack of Feature Estimation - SVG path data gives the direction and points where a path moves to. This path can form various complex shapes including non-geometric ones, which the model did not consider while interpreting.

Point 4: Unpredictability of Shape - The prompt implies that the shape can be complex, even unnatural, creating potential for mistakes, since it might be beyond the model's training data handle such complexity.

Improvement Points for Prompt:
1. Instead of expecting the model to interpret SVG path data, the task can be reframed to making the AI understand the written or textual description of the path, thus creating a better environment for understanding for the model.
2. The prompt can be expanded to suggest that the model consider the number of starting and ending points in each command of the SVG path data.
3. The concept of the SVG path data can be simplified and explained more properly in the prompt for better understanding of the model.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given the SVG path instructions, identify the complex geometric shape that it represents. Note that the path may include multiple lines or curves to construct the shape, it's not always a simple one linear shape.
(2) Given a description of a geometric shape, identify the most appropriate shape from the list of options. Note that the description might include details about lines, curves, angles, and other specific features of the shape. This task involves recognizing patterns and understanding context, rather than interpreting SVG paths.
(3) Given SVG path data representing a geometric shape, determine the correct shape it corresponds to from the available options. This task involves translating the SVG path data into representation of lines, curves, angles, and other geometric features that create a shape. Please remember you are not interpreting patterns or context, but rather decoding the SVG path to identify the shape it represents. Once you have identified the shape, select the appropriate option from the list.
(4) Given a set of SVG path data representing a geometric shape, your task is to determine the correct shape it corresponds to. This will involve decoding the SVG path data and identifying features such as lines, curves, angles, and other elements that comprise the geometric shape. Note that the shape might not be of the traditional variety and may be complex with intersecting lines or curves; angles that might be greater or less than 90 degrees; or multiple curves and lines.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example Reasoning:
In this example, the model seems to misinterpret the SVG path coordinates and proposes the wrong shape. It's possible that the model doesn't truly understand SVG paths but rather is making an educated guess and in this case, it's an incorrect guess. The SVG path indicated has seven distinct points, which corresponds to a heptagon, not a triangle as the model suggested.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Lack of Clarity: The prompt does not really explain what the model should focus on. As a result, the model might be focusing on keywords and missing crucial aspects of the problem.
2. Complexity: Working with SVG paths is a complex task that may be out of the model's capacity without specialized training in graphics or geometry.
3. AI Limitation: Language models lack the ability to visualize or internally model complex multi-dimensional data. A task involving judging the shape formed by SVG paths seems to be beyond the model's capabilities.  

To improve, the following aspects of the prompt can be considered:
1. Simplifying: Instead of working with complex SVG paths, try to simplify the task or provide more clear and detailed instructions. 
2. Additional Training: The AI might require additional or specific training on decoding SVG paths to identify shapes correctly.
3. Visual Input: Since this task is fundamentally graphical, it is best suited with a model that can process visual input. Hence, incorporating image or graphical analysis capabilities in the AI could improve performance in this task.

Wrong Answer: The model's response is: The SVG path provided draws a (J) triangle. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.

Reason: The model incorrectly identified the SVG path as creating a triangle shape. This is likely due to a lack of understanding or capability to interpret SVG path directly. SVG paths themselves are complex and require a level of geometrical calculation that the model may not be inherently capable of. It seems the model has picked a geometric shape randomly from the available options, leading to an incorrect response. The correct shape the SVG path corresponds to is a heptagon (B).

Improvement: The prompt should be revised to make it clearer and more understandable for the language model. Expecting the model to directly interpret SVG paths may be overly complex. Instead, the prompt could be redesigned to ask the model to identify SVG paths given examples of shapes with their corresponding paths. This would allow the model to identify patterns in SVG path data and match with corresponding shapes. This would be less reliant on direct interpretation of SVG paths, and more focused on pattern recognition and matching, which are strengths of AI language models. 

Another aspect that can be improved is the instruction. The request "respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>" might be confusing for the model. It could be simplified, instructing the model to state plainly what its chosen answer is.

To summarize, following aspects can improve the prompt:
1. Change the task from interpreting SVG paths to matching given shapes with corresponding SVG paths.
2. Clarify the instructions about how the answer should be presented by the model. 
3. Avoid tasks that may require more advanced mathematical or graphical interpretation beyond the current capabilities of the model.

Wrong Answer: The SVG path provided draws a (J) triangle.
Therefore, the answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.
Correct Label: B

Reasoning: 

1. Ambiguity in Problem Statement: The sequence of commands and numbers in SVG path language describe instructions to draw a shape. However, parsing these without a visual output or a clear set of rules might lead to misinterpretations. 

2. Complexity of SVG Path Language: The example provides a complex sequence of "Moveto" and "Lineto" commands. Without specialized knowledge and visualization of SVG coordinates and paths, it is challenging for the model to interprete these commands to generate the associated shape. 

3. Lack of SVG Knowledge: The model might lack an understanding of SVG path command language, leading to the incorrect prediction. 

To improve the prompt: 

1. Simplify the Task: Consider simplifying the task or providing a helper function that can process the SVG path language to plain English interpretation.

2. Clear Instructions: Explicitly state that model needs have specialized understanding for SVG path coordinates and their operations. 

3. Visualization: If possible, provide an image or simple animation demonstrating how an SVG path sequence draws a shape can be beneficial for the model's understanding. 

4. SVG Tutorial: Providing a brief SVG tutorial for the model or showcasing a few examples of how certain commands correspond to certain outcomes might enhance the model's performance. 

5. Guided Steps: Break down the task into steps such as identifying vertices, analyzing the angles and then determining the shape. 

In summary, to improve this prompt we need to simplify the task or provide strategies to handle it, ensure clear instructions, consider using visual aids, and provide a basic tutorial about SVG path language.

Wrong Answer: The SVG path provided draws a (J) triangle.
Therefore, the answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.
Correct Label: B

Reasoning: 

1. Ambiguity in Problem Statement: The sequence of commands and numbers in SVG path language describe instructions to draw a shape. However, parsing these without a visual output or a clear set of rules might lead to misinterpretations. 

2. Complexity of SVG Path Language: The example provides a complex sequence of "Moveto" and "Lineto" commands. Without specialized knowledge and visualization of SVG coordinates and paths, it is challenging for the model to interprete these commands to generate the associated shape. 

3. Lack of SVG Knowledge: The model might lack an understanding of SVG path command language, leading to the incorrect prediction. 

To improve the prompt: 

1. Simplify the Task: Consider simplifying the task or providing a helper function that can process the SVG path language to plain English interpretation.

2. Clear Instructions: Explicitly state that model needs have specialized understanding for SVG path coordinates and their operations. 

3. Visualization: If possible, provide an image or simple animation demonstrating how an SVG path sequence draws a shape can be beneficial for the model's understanding. 

4. SVG Tutorial: Providing a brief SVG tutorial for the model or showcasing a few examples of how certain commands correspond to certain outcomes might enhance the model's performance. 

5. Guided Steps: Break down the task into steps such as identifying vertices, analyzing the angles and then determining the shape. 

In summary, to improve this prompt we need to simplify the task or provide strategies to handle it, ensure clear instructions, consider using visual aids, and provide a basic tutorial about SVG path language.

Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64' 

Wrong Answer: The model's response is: 
<answer>(J) triangle</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: J

The problem seems to lie in the nature of the task itself; it is unrealistic to expect a language model to visualize geometric shapes from a set of coordinates. This task is better suited to a visual model, not a language model. In this case, the model probably assumed the least complicated shape with multiple points, which is a triangle.

Moreover, the model might have difficulty understanding the complexity of SVG path, the prompt has SVG path which is representing the coordinates. The model is failing to understand the SVG path and providing the answer based on the pre-existing coordinates.

In addition, the definitions or properties of the shapes are not explicitly given in the prompt, causing difficulty for the model to discern which set of coordinates corresponds to which geometrical shape.

To improve this task, following points can be considered:
1. The task should be simplified to expect language-related outputs from a language model, not visual modeling.
2. If the task is aimed at identifying geometric shapes, the definitions or properties of these shapes should be clearly provided, as well as clear rules how to determine the shapes from a set of coordinates.
3. It would be more efficient if instead of actual coordinates we use more high level descriptions or properties of the path.

<1> 

The question is asking the AI to recognize a shape given a set of coordinates and line paths. However, without the ability to visualize the coordinates in a two-dimensional space, it can be difficult for the language model to accurately identify the shape. The language model has only text input and doesn't have the ability to process the coordinates in a graphical or spatial manner. Therefore, it may have guessed the wrong shape based on the given information.

In this case, the AI wrongly identified the shape as a triangle, when the correct answer was a heptagon.

There are several issues with the prompt that might have led to this error:

1. The language model might not understand the meaning of line paths and vertices in the context of this question because it doesn't have the ability to visualize or process spatial information. 

2. It doesn't have the ability to mathematically compute the vertices using the given coordinates, which is a significant limitation in this scenario.

3. By providing multiple shape options, the prompt might be confusing for the model. It could interpret that it needs to select one of these options, instead of interpreting the coordinates and paths to come up with the correct shape.

Prompt improvement suggestions:

1. The task might be more suited for a machine learning model that can process spatial and graphical information, so consider using a different AI model for this task. 

2. If sticking with a language model, more specific prompts could be helpful. For example, providing detailed guidelines on how to interpret the data, or asking questions that a language model is more capable of answering like questions related to definitions or properties of shapes.

3. Instead of asking the AI to identify the shape, it could be asked to determine the number of vertices or angles based on the given line paths and coordinates. This would eliminate the need to visualize the shape and make the task more aligned with the capabilities of a language model.

4. It might also be helpful to structure the data in a more understandable format for the AI. Breaking down the data into smaller chunks or structuring it in a table could help the AI better interpret the data.

gradient:
The example provided is wrong due to several reasons:

1. Abstract concept:
The task given to the language model is quite abstract. Converting a series of coordinate points into a mental picture of a geometric shape is not easy, even for humans without visual aids, like a plot/graph. Hence, the language model may struggle to accurately predict the intended shape.

2. Lack of clarity:
While the prompt instructs the language model to "use them [coordinates and line paths] to identify the potential vertices and angles", it doesn't actually explain how to go about this process. The model could interpret this in multiple ways, leading to the wrong answer.

3. Insufficient logical instructions:
The prompt also does not provide clear logical instructions for the task. It doesn't give any details about how to identify the vertices from the coordinates, the angles, or how to identify the shape.

4. Misalignment between the task and the language model's abilities:
Language models excel in tasks involving natural language understanding and syntax following. However, they might not be the best tool to solve tasks that depend on mathematical logic or spatial ability, unless they are specifically trained to handle such tasks.

Based on these reasons, improving the prompt could involve the following:

- Provide more explicit instructions: Increase clarity over what exactly is being asked of the model and how to go about it. Clear, step-by-step instructions could help guide the model to an accurate answer.
- Align tasks with the model's strengths: Consider the strengths and weaknesses of the AI. If the task is heavily reliant on tasks outside of its core capabilities, consider revising the task or adapting it so that it can be solved using language understanding and syntax manipulation.
- Consider using visual aids: For tasks involving shapes and spaces, visuals can be extremely helpful. If possible, consider including diagrams or charts that can assist in conveying what is being asked.
- Ensure clarity in the required output format: Use a consistent output format and clearly specify this in the prompt. In this case, specifying that the answer should be in the format <answer>(Letter)</answer> could help the model.
- Apply a simpler approach: Sometimes, simplifying the task can lead to more accurate results. In this case, the challenge could be simplified by providing individual line paths for the model to identify rather than an entire shape formed by these paths. 

However, it must be reiterated that the correctness of the solution will also depend on the training of the specific model used. Training language models for such specific tasks may require specialized training data and methods.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
The example provided is wrong due to several reasons:

1. Abstract concept:
The task given to the language model is quite abstract. Converting a series of coordinate points into a mental picture of a geometric shape is not easy, even for humans without visual aids, like a plot/graph. Hence, the language model may struggle to accurately predict the intended shape.

2. Lack of clarity:
While the prompt instructs the language model to "use them [coordinates and line paths] to identify the potential vertices and angles", it doesn't actually explain how to go about this process. The model could interpret this in multiple ways, leading to the wrong answer.

3. Insufficient logical instructions:
The prompt also does not provide clear logical instructions for the task. It doesn't give any details about how to identify the vertices from the coordinates, the angles, or how to identify the shape.

4. Misalignment between the task and the language model's abilities:
Language models excel in tasks involving natural language understanding and syntax following. However, they might not be the best tool to solve tasks that depend on mathematical logic or spatial ability, unless they are specifically trained to handle such tasks.

Based on these reasons, improving the prompt could involve the following:

- Provide more explicit instructions: Increase clarity over what exactly is being asked of the model and how to go about it. Clear, step-by-step instructions could help guide the model to an accurate answer.
- Align tasks with the model's strengths: Consider the strengths and weaknesses of the AI. If the task is heavily reliant on tasks outside of its core capabilities, consider revising the task or adapting it so that it can be solved using language understanding and syntax manipulation.
- Consider using visual aids: For tasks involving shapes and spaces, visuals can be extremely helpful. If possible, consider including diagrams or charts that can assist in conveying what is being asked.
- Ensure clarity in the required output format: Use a consistent output format and clearly specify this in the prompt. In this case, specifying that the answer should be in the format <answer>(Letter)</answer> could help the model.
- Apply a simpler approach: Sometimes, simplifying the task can lead to more accurate results. In this case, the challenge could be simplified by providing individual line paths for the model to identify rather than an entire shape formed by these paths. 

However, it must be reiterated that the correctness of the solution will also depend on the training of the specific model used. Training language models for such specific tasks may require specialized training data and methods.

The correct label is: B (heptagon)
The model's prediction is: D (kite)

Reasons:
1. The question is asking the model to interpret an SVG path element and deduce the shape from it. This is a complex task as it involves visual interpretation of coordinates which is not a simple language task.
   
2. The SVG path element seems to still draw a polygon but how many vertices/sides it has and whether the sides and angles are equal are not descriptive enough in language for the model to understand, hence it's prone to generate wrong answers. 

3. It seems like the model is judging more on the initial path and less on the whole path. This can lead the model to wrong identification of the shape.

Aspects of improvement:
1. The prompt should ask for a geometric shape description in recognizable language format (e.g., stating number of vertices, sides, and angles, rather than a set of points in SVG format) that the AI model can understand.

2. The prompt needs to make it clear that the AI is expected to make predictions based on a textual description of geometric properties, not a visual interpretation of a set of coordinates.

3. We could potentially simplify the questions to not include highly complex geometric interpretations, or let the model train on similar examples so it gradually learns to interpret SVG paths. 

4. The task explanation at the beginning could also be improved to be more specific about the type and format of the descriptions expected in the prompt.

Provided Answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>

Reason: The SVG path element provided in this question is probably difficult for the AI to interpret correctly, as the model might not be programmed to understand and translate SVG strings directly. The model is trained with text and not with code. The incorrect answer suggests that the model wasn't able to comprehend the SVG code and might have given an arbitrary answer. 

Summary and improvements:

1. Clarity: The prompt should clearly articulate what the model is supposed to do. Instead of SVG path element, provide a textual description of the shape.

2. Simplicity: The tasks should be simplified. The model might not understand the input such as SVG path since it's more on the coding side. 

3. Context: The model might not be able to understand coding languages and make meaningful inferences from them. It would help if the prompts stick with natural language descriptions of shapes, as the model would likely perform better with natural language processing.

4. Specificity: More specific words could be used to describe the shapes more accurately and in more detail. 

5. Relevance: Stick to the type of data that the model was trained on. SVG paths are not the kind of data language models are typically trained on.

6. Formatting: The format of the question and the answer could be more streamlined. 

7. Consistency: Ensure that the example provided at the start and the test case is consistent.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:
The directions in the prompt are clear enough for humans, but possibly vague for an AI. It needs to determine the geometric shape from a given description. However, the description provided in this example isn't as clear and specific as it could be. It uses an SVG path element which is a form of code, and the AI may not be programmed to correctly interpret this code as information about vertices, sides, and angles.

Reason for the wrong answer: The model based its output on the code provided. However, it's unclear whether the AI has the capability to comprehend and transform this SVG path element into a meaningful understanding of a geometric shape, leading to a misinterpretation and incorrect answer.

Improvements:
To enhance the AI's accuracy, the description should be made more explicit. Instead of relying on SVG code, specific characteristics like the number of sides, vertices, and angles should be provided. For example, "A shape with seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles." This could be rephrased as "A 7-sided regular polygon", which requires less interpretation and provides a more specific description.

2) General Analysis:
The prompt does provide clear instructions for the model to answer, but with the wide range of possible descriptions (depending on how each shape is described), it's possible that the AI may not recognize certain less common descriptions or representations of shapes. The SVG code, for instance, was probably unclear to the model, leading to the wrong answer. 

Improvements:
Aside from making the descriptions clearer, another avenue for improvement is training the model to understand descriptions in various formats. Given the complexity of identifying shapes from natural language descriptions, the AI could be trained on a wide variety of descriptive formats, including SVG code.

Conclusion: The improvements identified from this example include making the descriptions more explicit and digestible, avoiding code or other complex descriptions where possible, and training the model on a wider variety of descriptive formats to account for a range of scenarios.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:
The directions in the prompt are clear enough for humans, but possibly vague for an AI. It needs to determine the geometric shape from a given description. However, the description provided in this example isn't as clear and specific as it could be. It uses an SVG path element which is a form of code, and the AI may not be programmed to correctly interpret this code as information about vertices, sides, and angles.

Reason for the wrong answer: The model based its output on the code provided. However, it's unclear whether the AI has the capability to comprehend and transform this SVG path element into a meaningful understanding of a geometric shape, leading to a misinterpretation and incorrect answer.

Improvements:
To enhance the AI's accuracy, the description should be made more explicit. Instead of relying on SVG code, specific characteristics like the number of sides, vertices, and angles should be provided. For example, "A shape with seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles." This could be rephrased as "A 7-sided regular polygon", which requires less interpretation and provides a more specific description.

2) General Analysis:
The prompt does provide clear instructions for the model to answer, but with the wide range of possible descriptions (depending on how each shape is described), it's possible that the AI may not recognize certain less common descriptions or representations of shapes. The SVG code, for instance, was probably unclear to the model, leading to the wrong answer. 

Improvements:
Aside from making the descriptions clearer, another avenue for improvement is training the model to understand descriptions in various formats. Given the complexity of identifying shapes from natural language descriptions, the AI could be trained on a wide variety of descriptive formats, including SVG code.

Conclusion: The improvements identified from this example include making the descriptions more explicit and digestible, avoiding code or other complex descriptions where possible, and training the model on a wider variety of descriptive formats to account for a range of scenarios.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given a SVG path, interpret the provided path coordinates, evaluate the potential vertices or angles, and identify the correct geometric shape that is being drawn. Consider that SVG Paths can symbolize more advanced shapes beyond basic ones. For instance, this SVG path element is given: <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> 

The options for the shape it draws are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Analyze the SVG path carefully and determine the correct shape it corresponds to. Please respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Given a set of coordinates and line paths, use them to identify the potential vertices and angles and determine the shape being described. Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64' 

The potential shapes, these coordinates could draw, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Creating a mental visualization, try to determine which shape the given coordinates and paths most likely connote. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, of the shape you think best fits.
(3) Given below is a description or set of properties, typically involving vertices, sides, and angles, which corresponds to a certain geometric shape. The shapes could range from basic ones to more advanced. Here's an example of such a description 'A shape with seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles.'  

The potential shapes, these descriptions could correspond to, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon

(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Your job is to use this description to accurately identify the correct geometric shape. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, that best represents the shape that matches the given description. 

For example:
For a shape that has seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles, the correct shape would be a heptagon. Therefore, the answer should be presented as <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Correct Answer: B

Reasoning: The problem with the prompt begins with the provided example. It uses the characteristics of a square (four vertices, equal sides, equal angles) but gives the answer as a rectangle, which could confuse the language model since squares and rectangles have different characteristics. The prompt does not necessarily indicate how the number of vertices or sides corresponds with the respective shape but expects the model to understand it.

Another issue with this specific example is that it refers to an SVG path element - this means it's essentially a coded representation of a shape, which makes the task of identifying the shape even more abstract and harder for the model. The language model might not be familiar with the conventions of SVG path syntax, making it difficult to interpret the shape based on this coded information.

Improvements:
1. Ensure that the example matches the answer. For example, if the characteristics of a square are described, the answer should be a square.
2. Be clear in your requirements. If the prompt involves interpreting coded data, specify whether this understanding is required.
3. For abstract tasks such as interpreting an SVG path element, provide examples with the correct answers to allow the model to deduce the underlying rules.
4. It would also be advisable not to limit the correct answer to a single fixed-choice format. This limits the utility of the model and doesn't allow it to showcase its understanding in a free-text answer.
5. If the model should still focus on the fixed choice format, ensure that the provided choices cover all potential answers adequately. Consider adding a square to the list of options.
6. Include a training set that contains SVG path examples to make the model aware of how to interpret these paths. 
7. The prompt can be made more explicit by adding the need to consider properties such as symmetry, dimensions, enclosed area etc. in determining the shape.

These improvements would allow the language model to better produce accurate shapes using the given geometric properties.

prompt: In this exercise, we are given descriptions or sets of properties of a geometric shape, usually involving criteria like numbers of vertices, sides, and angles (if applicable). The shapes can range from simple to complex. Here's an example of such a description: 'A 2D form having four vertices, four equal sides, and four equal angles.' 

The possible geometric forms that could fit these descriptions include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
(K) square

Taking into consideration factors like symmetry, dimensions, enclosed space, your job is to interpret and identify the correct geometric form that is described. 

Please reply with the corresponding alphabetic code of the form that best matches the given properties, and enclose it between <answer> and </answer> tags.

For example:
For a shape that has four vertices, four equal sides, and four equal angles, the correct shape would be a square, which is represented by the letter (K). So, the answer should be communicated as <answer>(K) square</answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Error in Example 1:
The reason that the model makes this error could largely be due to the fact that it does not inherently understand SVG paths or how these paths connote a specific geometric shape. The SVG path provided in this example is quite complex, and it's unrealistic to expect a language model to discern a 7-sided shape (heptagon) from this information. The model might have guessed a triangle due to the prompt's focus on vertices, sides, and angles, and it possibly interpreted the different "L" points in the SVG path as distinct vertices.

Improvements:
Based on this, the prompt could be improved in several ways:
1. Avoid shapes that the language model cannot interpret: In the context of this task, it would be better to describe shapes in terms of their basic geometric properties, rather than using an SVG path.
2. Define certain terms more accurately: When referencing characteristics like vertices, sides, and angles, it would be beneficial to further define these terms to ensure the model has a clear understanding.
3. State the specific characteristics of the shape, such as the number of sides or vertices directly in example. This could improve the model's capabilities in matching the description to the correct shape.
4. If SVG Paths are to be included, you should provide a clear way of discerning how many sides the shape will have based on that SVG path. Or else, exclude SVG paths altogether.
5. Provide a clearer difference between shapes that are similar: For instance, in the example shapes, square and rectangle both have four sides and could be easily mixed up without additional distinguishing information. It might be helpful to enhance the differences between similar shapes in the possible options.

(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given a SVG path, interpret the provided path coordinates, evaluate the potential vertices or angles, and identify the correct geometric shape that is being drawn. Consider that SVG Paths can symbolize more advanced shapes beyond basic ones. For instance, this SVG path element is given: <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> 

The options for the shape it draws are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Analyze the SVG path carefully and determine the correct shape it corresponds to. Please respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Given a set of coordinates and line paths, use them to identify the potential vertices and angles and determine the shape being described. Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64'

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Creating a mental visualization, try to determine which shape the given coordinates and paths most likely connote. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, of the shape you think best fits.
(3) Given below is a description or set of properties, typically involving vertices, sides, and angles, which corresponds to a certain geometric shape. The shapes could range from basic ones to more advanced. Here's an example of such a description 'A shape with seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles.'  

The potential shapes, these descriptions could correspond to, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Your job is to use this description to accurately identify the correct geometric shape. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, that best represents the shape that matches the given description. 

For example:
For a shape that has seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles, the correct shape would be a heptagon. Therefore, the answer should be presented as <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(J) triangle</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>

Reason for Error:
1. Lack of Image Recognition: Language models can't directly interpret SVG paths to determine the shape it represents. They might just be treating the SVG data as a string of text without understanding its meaning.
2. High Complexity: The prompt is a visually interpretative task that is well beyond the capabilities of a language-based model.

Potential Improvements:
1. Specify Tasks: Indicate in the prompt that the model is supposed to identify a shape from descriptive characteristics, not from SVG paths or other image-related codes.
2. Modify Examples: Use examples in the prompt that are textually descriptive, not requiring graphic interpretation.
3. Simplify Instructions: The instructions can be simplified; they currently provide room for misunderstanding the task.
4. Direct Format: Specify the shape's characteristics directly in the question instead of an SVG path.
5. Removal of SVG path: A language model cannot process SVG paths, they should be replaced with proper textual descriptions. 

Improved Prompt Suggestion:
Given below is a description of a geometric shape, specified by characteristics such as vertices, sides, etc. You're required to identify the correct shape from the options below and respond with its corresponding letter.

Your task is to use this description to accurately identify the correct type of geometric shape. Respond with the corresponding letter of the shape that best fits the description, and present it between <answer> and </answer> tags.

For example:
For a shape that has four vertices and equal sides and angles, the correct shape would be a square. Therefore, the answer should be presented as <answer>(H) rectangle</answer>.

Now, let's start with the following description: <INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE>.

Remember, your answer option must be between <answer> and </answer> tags.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(J) triangle</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: J.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> draws a 

Wrong Answer: <answer>(J) triangle</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>

Reason for Error:
1. Lack of Image Recognition: Language models can't directly interpret SVG paths to determine the shape it represents. They might just be treating the SVG data as a string of text without understanding its meaning.
2. High Complexity: The prompt is a visually interpretative task that is well beyond the capabilities of a language-based model.

Potential Improvements:
1. Specify Tasks: Indicate in the prompt that the model is supposed to identify a shape from descriptive characteristics, not from SVG paths or other image-related codes.
2. Modify Examples: Use examples in the prompt that are textually descriptive, not requiring graphic interpretation.
3. Simplify Instructions: The instructions can be simplified; they currently provide room for misunderstanding the task.
4. Direct Format: Specify the shape's characteristics directly in the question instead of an SVG path.
5. Removal of SVG path: A language model cannot process SVG paths, they should be replaced with proper textual descriptions. 

Improved Prompt Suggestion:
Given below is a description of a geometric shape, specified by characteristics such as vertices, sides, etc. You're required to identify the correct shape from the options below and respond with its corresponding letter.

Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

For instance, if the description is 'a 2D shape with four equal sides', your answer will be <answer>(H) rectangle</answer>.

Now follow the same process with the description: <INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE>. Please provide outputs in the following format <answer>(Letter) Name of the Shape</answer>

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given a SVG path, interpret the provided path coordinates, evaluate the potential vertices or angles, and identify the correct geometric shape that is being drawn. Consider that SVG Paths can symbolize more advanced shapes beyond basic ones. For instance, this SVG path element is given: <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> 

The options for the shape it draws are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Analyze the SVG path carefully and determine the correct shape it corresponds to. Please respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Given a set of coordinates and line paths, use them to identify the potential vertices and angles and determine the shape being described. Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64' 

The potential shapes, these coordinates could draw, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Creating a mental visualization, try to determine which shape the given coordinates and paths most likely connote. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, of the shape you think best fits.
(3) Given below is a description or set of properties, typically involving vertices, sides, and angles, which corresponds to a certain geometric shape. The shapes could range from basic ones to more advanced. Here's an example of such a description 'A shape with seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles.'  

The potential shapes, these descriptions could correspond to, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Your job is to use this description to accurately identify the correct geometric shape. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, that best represents the shape that matches the given description. 

For example:
For a shape that has seven vertices and equal sides and interior angles, the correct shape would be a heptagon. Therefore, the answer should be presented as <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>.
 
Now, let's start with this description: <INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE>.

At the end show the correct answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Given below is a description of a geometric shape, usually involving characteristics such as amount of vertices, sides, and angles. The shapes can be simple or advanced. Here's an example of such a description 'A 2D shape with four vertices and sides of equal length.' 

You should consider the following possible shapes:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Your task is to use this description to accurately identify the correct type of geometric shape. Respond with the corresponding letter of the shape that best fits the description, and present it between <answer> and </answer> tags.

For example:
For a shape that has four vertices and equal sides and angles, the correct shape would be a square. Therefore, the answer should be presented as <answer>(H) rectangle</answer>.

Now, let's start with the following description: <INSERT DESCRIPTION HERE>.

Remember, your answer option must be between <answer> and </answer> tags.

gradient:
<1> 
Prompt Reasoning:
The model arguably gets the problem wrong because the task is asking the language model to perform a task that it was not designed for - visualizing the Cartesian plane. The model does not have the capability to analyze SVG paths shared and visualize the relative positions of points represented by the coordinates on the Cartesian plane to form any particular shape. Therefore, the model isn't able to accurately identify the shapes formed by the SVG paths. Also, seemingly the task is multiclass classification with reasoning but it is presented in a way that is beyond the simple symbol matching ability of GPT-3.

Error Analysis:
According to the instructions, the SVG path depicts some shape in the Cartesian plane, however the model cannot visualize this or discern what the shape is. Thus, the model's choice "triangle" is flawed because it lacks understanding of the spatial relationships defined in the SVG path. 

Improvements:
1. The task could be restructured in a way that fits the capability of the language model. The current prompt is asking a task that is beyond the comprehension and visualization abilities of the model, it cannot view coordinates and judge what shape they form.
2. Clear and detailed context should be established for the possible coordination of the model's logic on the problem. 
3. The task could introduce more clear, deductive tasks that are less reliant on visualization. These could involve more logic or language-based questions, where the model can fully utilize its skills.
4. The prompt can integrate the description and instruction of the task more perfectly. The model might give wrong answers due to the confusion of unclear instruction or incorrect task design.
5. We could rephrase or simplify complex tasks to make them more in line with the abilities of the model. Remove the parts that require data or abilities that the model is known not to have.

You have been given a list of coordinates and line paths which form SVG paths that represent various shapes. Your task doesn't involve plotting these paths but the clues provided by number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path might help in determining the shape. 

Keeping in mind the following potential shapes, analyze the logical relationships rather than visual interpretations about them:
(A) circle, which has no vertices or line segments 
(B) heptagon, which has seven vertices and line segments 
(C) hexagon, which contains six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, formed by two pair of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, represented by just two vertices 
(F) octagon, that contains eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, composed of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, formed by four vertices and line segments, possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) sector, characterized by a curved path and two straight paths from a common vertex 
(J) triangle, it has three vertices and line segments

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question.

Wrong Answer: Analyzing the given SVG path, it appears that the vertices and line segments form a closed shape with 5 sides, which is a pentagon. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(G) pentagon</answer>.
Correct Answer: (B) heptagon

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of SVG Path: In this example, the language model may lack the inherent capability to visualize and interpret SVG path data and recognize that they form a heptagon. The model incorrectly identified the shape as a pentagon, suggesting a difficulty in properly interpreting and analyzing the path string.

2. Lack of Geometry Understanding: The model may lack a concrete understanding of fundamental geometric concepts. A correct solution would involve analyzing line segments and vertices, recognizing repetition in vertices, estimating angles, and understanding the properties of geometric shapes. Imbuing the model with a deeper understanding of these concepts might improve performance.

3. Overreliance on Textual Data: For this specific problem, the model seems to base its answer solely on the textual information provided, without having the capacity to visualize and interpret the SVG path data accurately. The ability to interpret graphical data might be crucial to solving this type of problem correctly.

Aspect that can improve the prompt:
1. Relevance of Answering Structure: While the example format is clearly stated, it may be redundant and introducing unnecessary complexity for the language model, causing it to struggle in producing the correct output.

2. The language model currently lacks the ability to accurately analyze SVG paths and discern shapes based on the given vertices. A prompt that could condition the model to comprehend this conversion from SVG paths to geometric shapes could potentially improve its predictive accuracy. 

3. The model needs a more grounded understanding of geometric shapes and their properties to accurately determine the shape that a set of vertices will form.

4. Possibly, the task could be further defined to lead the AI to understand that it is expected to interpret SVG paths and not merely analyze the text. The instructions could be made more pointed to facilitate better comprehension by the AI.

5. Considering the limitations of the language model in interpreting graphical data, you could provide a mapping of common SVG path strings to geometric shapes in the input to aid the model's understanding.

Given a sequence of coordinates that forms an SVG path, your task is to determine the shape that the path represents. The path could represent either basic geometric shapes or more complex shapes. A vertex is considered at each coordinate pair, with two successive vertices forming a line segment.

Given the SVG path '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64', recognize the vertices and line segments that the path may form. 

These vertices and line segments could potentially represent the following shapes:

(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Based on the quantity of vertices, the positioning, the relation between line segments and vertices, and the possible angles they form, determine the most likely shape. Respond with the corresponding letter of the shape you decide, enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. 

For instance, if your response is a heptagon, your answer should be written as <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>, whereas for a circle, your answer should be formatted as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. There is only one correct answer for each question.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: 
The model's response might be incorrect because it fails to interpret the SVG path correctly. SVG path analyses require the recognition of move "M" commands and line "L" commands, which form the vertices. Misinterpretation of vertices and consequently the number of sides/edges could lead to incorrect identification of the shape. This seems to be the case in this example, where the model counts five sides and identifies the shape as a pentagon (G), when in reality, it's a heptagon (B). 

Prompt Improvement Aspects: 

a) Include some explanation or rules about how to interpret different commands in an SVG path. This might help the model to understand the formation of the shape more accurately by correctly identifying vertices.

b) Emphasize more on identifying properties of shapes, like number of vertices, edges, and properties of angles which will help in correct recognition.

c) The prompt could include a step for verifying the answer. The model can compare characteristics of the identified shape with actual properties of shapes to ensure correctness.

d) Since this task requires a decent understanding of SVG paths and geometry, the training data should include a wide variety of shapes, patterns and complexities to ensure the model is well equipped to handle different scenarios. 

e) Emphasize on the fact that each set of coordinates forms a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment. This can assist the model to correctly determine the number of vertices or sides of the shape.

Here's an example of such a path: 'M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64'. 

Could this path possibly correspond to one of the following shapes?
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Please visualize and analyze the SVG path, considering the vertices and line segments they form. Then, identify which shape, from the given options, these vertices and segments likely represent.

For instance, if the result is a triangle, respond as <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. Alternatively, if you identify a circle, the correct response is <answer>(A) circle</answer>. 

For each question, there is only one correct response option. Please consider the properties of each shape, like the number of vertices, lines, and angles, to ensure your selection is accurate.

Once you have made your selection, give your answer in the following format: <answer>(Letter) Shape</answer>.

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question. 

For interpretation, consider that each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong example Reasoning: 
In the given incorrect example, the model chooses the wrong answer (hexagon) instead of the correct one (heptagon). A possible reason could be due to the complexity and potential ambiguity in the SVG path element given. The major challenge of this task is decoding SVG paths as it can be a difficult task for an AI model to perform accurately without plotting or visualizing the paths. The language model, trained on raw text, doesn't inherently know how to decode them.

2) Improvements in the Prompt:

a) Clarity: The current prompt may cause confusion due to its highly technical nature. It is vital to specify in simpler and clearer terms how to approach SVG paths in order to deduce the shapes they represent.

b) Instructions: There could be more specific instructions on how to interpret SVG paths. Presently, the only guidance about SVG paths interpretation is: "each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertices form a line segment." The model may require more explicit guidance to correctly decode SVG paths.

c) Context and Depth: The prompt could be improved by providing context or basic knowledge on how SVG paths work and how to decode them accurately. This includes understanding SVG path commands and how they translate into vertices and line segments.

d) Examples: Provide some examples of SVG paths and their corresponding decompositions. This could train the model better in understanding the logical relationships between SVG paths and shapes.

Incorporating these aspects can lead to a more comprehensive and effective prompt, possibly leading to correct responses from the model.

Incorporating these aspects can lead to a more comprehensive and effective prompt, possibly leading to correct responses from the model.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given a SVG path, interpret the provided path coordinates, evaluate the potential vertices or angles, and identify the correct geometric shape that is being drawn. Consider that SVG Paths can symbolize more advanced shapes beyond basic ones. For instance, this SVG path element is given: <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> 

The options for the shape it draws are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Analyze the SVG path carefully and determine the correct shape it corresponds to. Please respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Given a set of coordinates and line paths, use them to identify the potential vertices and angles and determine the shape being described. Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64' 

The potential shapes, these coordinates could draw, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Creating a mental visualization, try to determine which shape the given coordinates and paths most likely connote. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, of the shape you think best fits.
(3) Given a set of coordinates that form a SVG path, analyze and interpret them to identify the possible vertices. From these vertices, estimate the angles and shape they may represent. The shapes may range from basic geometric ones to more complex shapes. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64'. For simplicity, each coordinate pair is considered a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

The potential shapes that these vertices could form include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Visualize and analyze the SVG path, try to determine which shape, from the given list, the vertices and line segments most likely form. Provide your answer as the corresponding letter, framed between <answer> and </answer>.

For example, if your answer is triangle, you would respond as <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. However, if your answer is a circle, you would respond as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. For each question, only one response option is correct. 

Refer to the vertices and the potential shapes listed above to make your selection, and frame your answer in the prescribed format.
(4) You have been given a list of coordinates and line paths which form SVG paths that represent various shapes. Your task doesn't involve plotting these paths but the clues provided by number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path might help in determining the shape.

(E) line, represented by just two vertices 
(F) octagon, that contains eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, composed of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, formed by four vertices and line segments, possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) sector, characterized by a curved path and two straight paths from a common vertex 
(J) triangle, it has three vertices and line segments

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question. 

For interpretation, consider that each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

Correct Answer: (B) heptagon
Model's Answer: (C) hexagon

Step 1 – Identify the error: The model incorrectly identifies the shape as a hexagon with six vertices instead of a heptagon with seven vertices. 

Step 2 – Understand why the error happened:
The model appears to be unable to accurately count the vertices based on SVG paths. Although the prompt advises using the number of vertices and line segments as clues, the model may not be properly capitalizing on this advice and may simply be guessing.

Step 3 – Suggest improvements: 
The model might benefit from a more explicit and simplified explanation of how to deduce the shape using the provided SVG paths. For example, the prompt may specify that the order of coordinates paints a line path and that the number of line paths can indicate the vertices of the shape.

Improvement aspects:

1. Emphasize the significance of understanding and applying the rules to find the number of vertices and line segments based on SVG paths.
2. Address the cognition gap that may exist when converting SVG paths to logical conclusions.
3. Reinforce the concept that the completion task involves analytical reasoning and is not a visual task.
4. Explicitly mention the number of vertices a shape possesses in its geometric definition.
5. Incorporate examples where a simple SVG path is broken down into logical steps, showing the count of vertices to clarify any ambiguity.
6. Express complexity in the same terms throughout the whole prompt, this involves maintaining a steady cognitive load.

6. Express complexity in the same terms throughout the whole prompt, this involves maintaining a steady cognitive load.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given a SVG path, interpret the provided path coordinates, evaluate the potential vertices or angles, and identify the correct geometric shape that is being drawn. Consider that SVG Paths can symbolize more advanced shapes beyond basic ones. For instance, this SVG path element is given: <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> 

The options for the shape it draws are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Analyze the SVG path carefully and determine the correct shape it corresponds to. Please respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Given a set of coordinates and line paths, use them to identify the potential vertices and angles and determine the shape being described. Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64' 

The potential shapes, these coordinates could draw, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Creating a mental visualization, try to determine which shape the given coordinates and paths most likely connote. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, of the shape you think best fits.
(3) Given a set of coordinates that form a SVG path, analyze and interpret them to identify the possible vertices. From these vertices, estimate the angles and shape they may represent. The shapes may range from basic geometric ones to more complex shapes. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64'. For simplicity, each coordinate pair is considered a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

The potential shapes that these vertices could form include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Visualize and analyze the SVG path, try to determine which shape, from the given list, the vertices and line segments most likely form. Provide your answer as the corresponding letter, framed between <answer> and </answer>.

For example, if your answer is triangle, you would respond as <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. However, if your answer is a circle, you would respond as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. For each question, only one response option is correct. 

Refer to the vertices and the potential shapes listed above to make your selection, and frame your answer in the prescribed format.
(4) You have been given a list of coordinates and line paths which form SVG paths that represent various shapes. Your task doesn't involve plotting these paths but the clues provided by number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path might help in determining the shape. 

Keeping in mind the following potential shapes, analyze the logical relationships rather than visual interpretations about them:
(A) circle, which has no vertices or line segments 
(B) heptagon, which has seven vertices and line segments 
(C) hexagon, which contains six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, formed by two pair of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, represented by just two vertices 
(F) octagon, that contains eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, composed of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, formed by four vertices and line segments, possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) sector, characterized by a curved path and two straight paths from a common vertex 
(J) triangle, it has three vertices and line segments

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question. 

For interpretation, consider that each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

You are given a SVG path drawn from a list of coordinates and line paths. These SVG paths represent different geometric shapes. The task doesn't entail visually graphing these paths. 
Nevertheless, details embedded in the SVG paths such as the count of vertices, angles, and line sections can aid in deciphering the underlying shape. 

Consider the vertices as the coordinate pairs listed in the SVG paths. A pair of sequential coordinates form a line segment. The tally of these vertices and line segments might help unveil the shape being denoted.

Here are potential shapes and their unique geometric attributes to consider:
(A) Circle, devoid of vertices or line segments 
(B) Heptagon, possessing seven vertices and line segments 
(C) Hexagon, made up of six vertices and line segments
(D) Kite, constructed from two pairs of equal length line segments sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) Line, represented by merely two vertices
(F) Octagon, containing eight vertices and line segments
(G) Pentagon, consisting of five vertices and line segments
(H) Rectangle, constructed with four vertices and line segments and possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) Sector, distinguished by a curved path and two straight paths sharing a common vertex 
(J) Triangle, encompassing three vertices and line segments

You are to deduce, relying solely on the logical interpretations and not visual insights, the potential shape being represented by the provided SVG path. Your answer should be structured as follows: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where the 'Letter' corresponds to the letter from A to J depicting the shape, and 'Shape' is the name of the corresponding shape itself.

For instance, let's say, you determine that the SVG path depicts a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) Circle</answer>. Contrastingly, if the shape is predicted to be a triangle, you would respond as <answer>(J) Triangle</answer>. Note that only one answer option is correct per question. 

Now, using this approach, identify the shape being represented. Follow the example directions in framing your answer. 

Given a SVG path, determine and state the most likely shape description based on the listed options. Remember, your objective is to gauge the logical relations from the attributes present in the SVG path without resorting to any graphical representation. <END>

Model's response: <answer>(C) hexagon</answer>
Correct label: B (heptagon)

Reason for the wrong answer: 

The model might have calculated the vertices and lines incorrectly. Since it can't visualize or physically plot the SVG paths, it may have interpreted the path as having six vertices rather than seven. The language model is, after all, not designed to process complex mathematical formats and geometrical understanding in the current setting.

Prompt Improvement:

1) Clear Instructions: Clearly define and elaborate the rules or logic that the model should follow. For instance, explicitly instruct the model to count vertices (coordinate pairs) and match them to the properties of the given shapes.

2) Simplify: Simplify the prompt into more manageable tasks. Provide SVG path examples with the intended translation into vertices and line segments. 

3) Guide the Prediction: Redirect the model's attention to critical details such as the angle or line segment count, to prevent confusion with similar shapes like hexagon and heptagon.

4) Sequential Prompting: Break down the tasks for the model to first determine the number of vertices and then correlate it to a shape.

5) Pre-Evaluation Instruction: Consider adding prelim evaluation tasks to review the rules given in the prompt before finally permitting the model to answer the main question.

6) Declarative Definitions: Define the shapes by their vertices count. Too many details about the shapes may confuse the model. 

7) Direct Context: Provide more context or examples of the desired output format from a given SVG path. 

8) Sequential Exposition: Unfold the SVG path information sequentially rather than giving it all at once, to ensure the model digests each piece of information before proceeding to the next one.

Conclusively, a structured, more straightforward, and detailed step-by-step approach could enhance the model's performance in correctly predicting the shape based on SVG paths.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
You have been given a list of coordinates and line paths which form SVG paths that represent various shapes. Your task doesn't involve plotting these paths but the clues provided by number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path might help in determining the shape. 

Keeping in mind the following potential shapes, analyze the logical relationships rather than visual interpretations about them:
(A) circle, which has no vertices or line segments 
(B) heptagon, which has seven vertices and line segments 
(C) hexagon, which contains six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, formed by two pair of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, represented by just two vertices 
(F) octagon, that contains eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, composed of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, formed by four vertices and line segments, possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) sector, characterized by a curved path and two straight paths from a common vertex 
(J) triangle, it has three vertices and line segments

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question. 

For interpretation, consider that each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

Conclusively, a structured, more straightforward, and detailed step-by-step approach could enhance the model's performance in correctly predicting the shape based on SVG paths.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Name geometric shapes from their SVG paths
(1) Given a SVG path, interpret the provided path coordinates, evaluate the potential vertices or angles, and identify the correct geometric shape that is being drawn. Consider that SVG Paths can symbolize more advanced shapes beyond basic ones. For instance, this SVG path element is given: <path d="M 59.18,98.64 L 65.20,80.96 L 57.00,68.63 L 55.43,56.00 M 55.43,56.00 L 67.76,43.69 M 67.76,43.69 L 80.38,62.66 L 92.36,80.67 L 59.18,98.64"/> 

The options for the shape it draws are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Analyze the SVG path carefully and determine the correct shape it corresponds to. Please respond the answer option surrounded by <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Given a set of coordinates and line paths, use them to identify the potential vertices and angles and determine the shape being described. Be aware that the descriptions could represent shapes more complex than basic geometric ones. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64' 

The potential shapes, these coordinates could draw, include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Creating a mental visualization, try to determine which shape the given coordinates and paths most likely connote. Respond with the corresponding letter, encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>, of the shape you think best fits.
(3) Given a set of coordinates that form a SVG path, analyze and interpret them to identify the possible vertices. From these vertices, estimate the angles and shape they may represent. The shapes may range from basic geometric ones to more complex shapes. Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64'. For simplicity, each coordinate pair is considered a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

The potential shapes that these vertices could form include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Visualize and analyze the SVG path, try to determine which shape, from the given list, the vertices and line segments most likely form. Provide your answer as the corresponding letter, framed between <answer> and </answer>.

For example, if your answer is triangle, you would respond as <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. However, if your answer is a circle, you would respond as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. For each question, only one response option is correct. 

Refer to the vertices and the potential shapes listed above to make your selection, and frame your answer in the prescribed format.
(4) You have been given a list of coordinates and line paths which form SVG paths that represent various shapes. Your task doesn't involve plotting these paths but the clues provided by number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path might help in determining the shape. 

Keeping in mind the following potential shapes, analyze the logical relationships rather than visual interpretations about them:
(A) circle, which has no vertices or line segments 
(B) heptagon, which has seven vertices and line segments 
(C) hexagon, which contains six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, formed by two pair of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, represented by just two vertices 
(F) octagon, that contains eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, composed of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, formed by four vertices and line segments, possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) sector, characterized by a curved path and two straight paths from a common vertex 
(J) triangle, it has three vertices and line segments

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question. 

For interpretation, consider that each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

1. Unclear Instruction: The initial instructions don't clarify whether the model should count repeating SVG path coordinates as one point or distinct points. In this example, one point (M 59.18,98.64 and L 59.18,98.64) is counted as a unique point causing an incorrect count of the number of distinct points. 

2. Misinterpretation: The model incorrectly identifies the geometric shape as a triangle, perhaps extrapolating from the first three sets of points. However, this prompt does not sufficiently instruct the model to account for all points when estimating the geometric shape.

3. Interpretation Complexity: An SVG path can describe complex geometric shapes beyond simple triangles, rectangles, etc. The prompt does not guide the model to recognize more complex patterns or compound shapes.

4. SVG Understanding: The model might not understand the significance of the SVG path commands (M, L) and how they influence the final shape. 

Improvement Aspects:

1. Specify Clarity: The prompt should clearly state whether repeating SVG path coordinates should be considered as distinct points.

2. Shape Estimation: Model should be instructed to consider all points when forming an estimation of the shape.

3. Encourage Complexity Consideration: The prompt should guide the model to recognize more complex or compound geometric shapes. 

4. SVG Commands Instruction: The prompt could include guidance for interpreting SVG path commands (M, L, etc.) and how they influence the shape creation.

5. Define Possible Shapes: The prompt can include a clarification about which geometric shapes the model should consider. This might help focus the model's predictions.

gradient:
1) Example Analysis:
The SVG path consists of instructions that describe the movement of a pen in two dimensions. The language model seems to be estimating the number of distinct points correctly because it correctly identifies that 9 distinct points exist. However, it fails to interpret the sequence of points to determine the correct geometric shape, suggesting a triangle instead of a heptagon. 

Reasons For Misinterpretation:
i) The model might be overgeneralizing and considering only the endpoints of the path to identify a triangular shape.
ii) Alternatively, the model might not have the necessary knowledge about SVG paths – it requires understanding how the path data (i.e., numbers after “M”, “L”) correlate with points.
iii) The model might lack the ability to translate the SVG path instructions into geometric shapes.

2) Ways To Improve The Prompt:
a) Make it clear that the model needs to interpret the SVG path instruction sequence, not just count the endpoints. 
b) Environment-Reality: Although the SVG path describes movements in two dimensions, the model might not understand this. Therefore, make sure to explain the SVG path in terms of a real-life analogy (like a pen moving on a paper).
c) Provide more context or examples of SVG paths and geometry, so the model has additional chances to learn the correct correlation. 
d) Ask the model to perform its work in steps (first draw or virtually visualize the path, then estimate the geometric figure). This may assist the model in processing the task more efficiently.

gradient:
For <1>:

Reasoning:
1. The prompt is asking the model to estimate the number of distinct points in the SVG path and suggest the possible geometric shape. However, the complexity of deciphering an SVG path may be beyond the capability of the model as it requires not only basic geometric understanding, but interpretation of SVG syntax and rules.
2. The model might be deducing the shape purely from the number of distict points, which is incorrect as the same number of points can correspond to different shapes depending on the connection rules of the paths.
3. The model might not have understood that in SVG, a "move" operation (represented by 'M') points to a new position but doesn't draw a line to it; and a "line" operation (represented by 'L') draws a line from the current position to the new position. In this sense, count of 'M' and 'L' commands are handled differently.

Possible improvements:
1. The prompt could be simplified to only involves tasks such as entity recognition or sentiment analysis, which the model might be more capable of.
2. The prompt could clarify that SVG path commands must be understood in specific ways: 'M' moves without drawing a line, and 'L' adds a line. Thus increasing the nuance of the model's analysis.
3. The prompt could instruct the model to give more importance to the SVG path sequence instead of just the number of distinct points. For example, two 'M' commands followed by 'L' commands may indicate a complex shape with non-continuous lines.
4. Add a pre-processing stage where SVG paths are converted to a more understandable format or visual image for the model. Then, the model can answer questions based on this more accessible input.
5. It might be a good idea to split the task into several smaller tasks - understanding SVG paths, estimating points, and predicting shapes. This would make the task easier for the model, and also make the task of prompt design more manageable.

The first potential issue with the current prompt is that it assumes that the AI model has the capacity to analyze and interpret SVG path data to recognize geometric shapes. This may be beyond the capabilities of current language models that are primarily text-based and non-visual in their understanding.

Secondly, there is a flaw in the prompt where it mentions the model to consider repeating points. Given SVG paths can often repeat points, considering them as distinct might lead the model to count more points than there actually are, thereby leading to the wrong geometric shape.

Finally, it requires the model to visually connect dots to form a geometric shape – a task that is usually done by machine vision models, not language models. The misjudged visual resemblance of the shape to a kite is an evident example of this issue.

Ways to improve this prompt could include:

1. Removing any requirement for the model to visually interpret data. This is typically outside the functional capabilities of language models.
2. Making the prompt more explicit about the nature of the SVG data. This could include adding a clear instruction to properly account for repeated points or other potential complications in SVG data.
3. Instead of making the model count distinct points in the SVG path, the correct number of points or lines could be directly specified in the prompt for accurate shape prediction.
4. Altering the task to provide more context and constraints, such as a pre-established link between certain sets of points and their associated geometric shapes.
5. Setting the expectation of SVG commands understanding and execution more realistically. Models need clear instructions regarding how to handle SVG commands and what to ignore.

The model's response is: 
Analyzing the given SVG path, we can identify the following distinct points:
1. (59.18, 98.64)
2. (65.20, 80.96)
3. (57.00, 68.63)
4. (55.43, 56.00)
5. (67.76, 43.69)
6. (80.38, 62.66)
7. (92.36, 80.67)

Connecting these points, we can see that they form a shape that resembles a kite. Therefore, the most plausible geometric shape that could be formed from these points is a kite.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) kite</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

The model seems to misunderstand the necessity to correctly analyze the SVG path instructions. Instead, it arbitrarily connects the points together into a shape that it seems to think fits the description best. It doesn't consider the SVG path commands in the right order. In the example, the model just analyzed the distinct points, without giving attention to the shape that the connective lines formed by SVG commands such as M(move to) and L(line to) are creating. Thus, it mistakenly identified the shape as a kite instead of a heptagon.

Another error observed might be due to the language model's lack of understanding of geometric shapes. The language model might not be completely accurate in recognizing distinct shapes such as heptagon.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify SVG path: Emphasize that each specific SVG command instructs a new line and should be considered as part of the task. Make it explicit that the model should follow and decode the SVG path commands as an integral part of the task instead of just restricting to recognizing distinct coordinates.

2. Define ways to recognize shapes: Request the model to follow a systematic process to recognize shapes. This should involve counting the number of points and the type of lines the SVG commands form. 

3. Emphasize order of points: The model should understand that the recognition of shapes often involves considering the order of points and not merely the existence of distinct points. 

4. Shape recognition: Consider adding a directive that asks the language model to learn or review about geometric shapes to enhance the transformers inherent knowledge about them.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong example analysis:

The main issue here seems to be the model's interpretation and visual analysis of the SVG path. In translating the SVG instructions to distinct points for shape recognition, the model has interpreted a 'kite' shape. This demonstrates an issue in the model's shape recognition ability rather than a problem with the prompt.

2) Reasons for wrong answer:

a) Inaccurate shape recognition: the model has mistakenly interpreted the SVG path as forming a 'kite' instead of a 'heptagon'. This error results from an issue in the model's ability to accurately recognize shapes based on a set of points and not a fault in the prompt itself.

b) Oversimplification: It seems the complexity of the SVG path and the number of different points led the model to simplify the shape, identifying it as a 'kite' rather than a 'heptagon'. Again, this suggests an issue with the model's ability to recognize complex shapes rather than an issue with the prompt design.

3) Suggestions for improving the prompt:

The prompt should work on increasing the complexity recognition capacity of the model. However, considering that the issue lies primarily with the model's interpretation, rather than the prompt itself, the prompt does not necessarily need changing. The most beneficial avenue would be to improve the model's ability to recognize and visualize SVG paths accurately to increase the chances of correct shape identification. This might involve training the model with a wider range of SVG paths and shapes, including more complex and compound shapes, to enhance its shape recognition abilities. 

Another potential improvement could be the addition of explicit instructions in the prompt that require the model to take into account the end and start of the path, which may improve the accuracy of complex shape recognition.

The model's response is:

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Problematic Instruction:
The prompt requires the model to "meticulously interpret the path instructions." This is a somewhat vague directive and could lead the model to focus more on the complexity of the SVG path instructions, rather than on identifying the shape that these instructions are meant to create. 

Mistake: The model might have fixated on the complexity of the instructions and overlooked the clear essence of the problem, which is to identify the probable geometric figure from the given path data. 

Solution: Instructions should clearly tell the model to focus more on interpreting the final form of the shape made by the points rather than the path instructions itself.

2) Confusing Explanation:
The prompt stresses recognizing "multitudes of geometric shapes, simple and complex," which might lead the model into thinking that the solution is a more complex shape, skewing its answer choice away from more simple shapes like a heptagon.

Mistake: The model chose 'kite' which could be considered as a compound shape made of triangles, aligning with the prompt's suggestion of possibly recognizing complex shapes.

Solution: Clarify that while the task may include recognizing complex shapes, simplicity should not be ruled out.

3) Missing Essential Skill:
The task requires the model to recognize the significance of each SVG command and its impact on the final shape. For instance, 'M' commands for moving without drawing while 'L' commands for lines. The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to be aware of the impact of this on the final shape.

Mistake: The model may not appreciate the significance of such commands, hence mischaracterizing the end shape.

Solution: The prompt should more explicitly instruct the model to understand the role of the SVG commands in shaping the end figure.

Improvements for the prompt:

1) Add explicit instructions to focus more on interpreting the final form of the shape made by the points, rather than getting overwhelmed by the complexity of the path instructions.

2) Clarify that while the task may include recognizing complex shapes, simplicity should not be ruled out. 

3) Include specific instructions for recognizing the impact of each SVG command on the final shape. 

4) The model should not seize on single aspects (e.g., recognizing a part of the shape or a subset of the shape), but instead recognize the shape as a whole, which includes a focus on how the points connect rather than just the points themselves. 

5) The model should not assume repetition of points indicates a complex figure but rather consider the possibility of simpler geometric figures with repeated points.

Wrong answer: (D) kite

Correct answer: (B) heptagon

Reasons for the mistake:

1. Complexity in Understanding SVG Commands: The language model may have difficulty correctly interpreting the SVG commands for plotting points. Interpreting SVG path commands like "M" (move to) and "L" (line to) might be challenging for the model as it requires the model to contextually understand and envision these commands.

2. Difficulty with geometric analysis: The AI might find it difficult to analyze a compound shape made up of several parts accurately. The heptagon, in this example, is constructed from the combination of multiple simpler shapes. The model incorrectly identified one of these constituent shapes (a kite) rather than the whole.

3. High dependency on answer options: The language model might heavily rely upon the provided answer options rather than its own comprehension and analysis of the SVG data. For instance, it may have seen 'kite' as a more common shape than a 'heptagon' and thus selected it incorrectly.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. More detailed instruction for SVG command interpretation: The instructions in the prompt can be more explicit about how to interpret points in SVG commands. It could specify that the model should consider the overall shape of the combined segments and not just individual portions of it.

2. Emphasizing on complete analysis: The prompt should emphasize the need to identify the complete shape formed by all points rather than its parts. Important to highlight that the SVG path may represent a complex shape, which is a combination of simpler shapes.

3. Encourage deeper analysis over easy choices: The prompt could encourage the model to dig deeper into the analysis, rather than relying on a potentially biased recognition of more common shapes. This might help it make a more informed decision based on the actual data provided rather than the answer options. 

4. Clarification on unique points: The prompt could be more specific and clear that repeated points should be treated as a change in direction or a new line segment in the path, not as a new unique point. This may help the model better visualize the entire image. 

5. Training on SVG dataset: If possible, the language model's training on SVG literacy could be improved, enabling it to understand an SVG path data more accurately, which should result in a better prediction.

With this data at hand, strive to identify an array of geometric forms, ranging from elementary to intricate, or those constructed from multiple components. In attempting to discern the shape, do not let common shapes overshadow less common ones, as the SVG path may denote a complex or compound shape. The objective is to meticulously conclude about the geometric shape represented by these points, considering the whole and not just parts. Your tentative shape suggestion should then be matched from the provided answer options, reflecting the most probable shape that emerges from the composed points. Conclude with your final answer, framed distinctly between <answer> and </answer>.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(J) triangle</answer>

Correct Answer: <answer>(B) heptagon</answer>

Analysis: 
1. One issue might be the complexity of the SVG path, which contains many 'M' and 'L' commands and includes multiple lines. This poses a higher level of abstraction that might not be easily to be processed by the AI model.
    
2. The prompt heavily emphasizes on the total of unique points. However, the number of unique points doesn't necessarily determine the shape. For instance, a rectangle and a triangle could technically both have 3 unique points if one point is visited more than once.

3. Furthermore, the information provided in the prompt about recognizing shapes, both simple and complex, isn't precise enough. The AI model may need further elaboration or assistance in understanding how to delineate those shapes based on SVG path details.

To improve the prompt:

1. Simplify and provide clearer instructions on interpreting SVG paths, specifically how to translate 'M' (move to) and 'L' (line to) commands into comprehensible forms.

2. Emphasize not just on total unique points, but also consider the order of the points, lines, and the overall path structure in the SVG command. This could assist the model to have a better estimation of the shape beyond the mere count of unique points.

3. Include more guidance on shape recognition. This can be in the form of instructions on how to identify corners, angles, and sides, or how to differentiate between simple and complex shapes.

4. Instead of suggesting to generate the 'most plausible' shape, instruct the model to determine the 'exact' shape formed by the points, since in geometric terms, there would ideally be only one correct answer.

5. If possible, provide examples or additional training on understanding and interpreting SVG paths to shapes. This can help the model to generalize better and increase the accuracy of shape prediction.
   
6. Finally, ensure the model understands that the task is about connecting the points in the order given by the path instructions to form the final shape. Paths with repeated points may form shapes that are typically unexpected if just counting unique points.

gradient:
1) Wrong example analysis:

In this input, the SVG path is complex and has various moves and line commands. The language model seems to have taken these directives and deduced a kite shape, instead of the correct heptagon shape. This could be due to several factors:

a) Misinterpretation of SVG commands: The language model might have misinterpreted the SVG commands, which include 'move to', 'line to', and their corresponding coordinates. The model concluded that these are instructions for a kite shape rather than a heptagon shape.

b) Complexity of shape: The language model could be biased towards picking simpler shapes like kites over more complex shapes like heptagons, hence leading to the incorrect output.

c) Misunderstanding the prompt: The model may not understand the task well enough to analyze the SVG path correctly and identify the geometrical shape it forms. The model might not have translated the line and move commands accurately into geometric points for proper shape identification.

To improve the prompt based on these factors, we should:

i) Simplify the task: The task can be worded in a more simplified manner that emphasizes the interpretation of SVG path commands, treating each point as unique and understanding the shape through them. 

ii) Emphasize complexity of shape: The prompt should also emphasize that the shape could be simple or complicated, and even if points are repeated, it doesn't imply a simple shape.

iii) Clear instructions about decision making: The prompt currently asks to choose the shape considering both simplicity and complexity. This instruction may be confusing for the model. More explicit directives for choosing the most likely shape should be provided.

iv) Stress on visualization: Encourage the model to 'visualize' the points and the lines they form when interpreting the SVG commands.

v) Clarify outcome format: It could be made clear in the prompt that the answer must be a letter from the options provided in brackets, to align with the correct label format. This might help the model align its responses more accurately.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Error Analysis: One possible issue that led to an incorrect response is that the given prompt does not present detailed instructions to the AI to help it accurately interpret SVG path commands. Judging the geometry of shape from SVG path data requires a nuanced understanding of SVG instructions, which the AI model might not posses. Chances are it made a guess based on some general keywords in the input. The phrase 'your task is to analyze this information to identify the geometry of the shape' did not give the model enough specific directions to achieve the correct answer.

Suggestions for Improvement:

1) Provide Example - Give an actual example of how to interpret SVG path commands and convert them into shapes. This can provide the AI with concrete steps to learn from.
  
2) Explicit Instructions - Outline clear and explicit instructions for each step of the process. For instance:
  - Identify all unique coordinates and the sequence in which they appear.
  - Count these coordinates to estimate the number of unique points that form the path.
  - Explain how the SVG 'M' and 'L' commands contribute to creating the lines that form shapes.

3) SVG Commands - Emphasize how to interpret SVG commands and how those commands relate to the construction of different geometric shapes. For instance:
  - 'M' means move to a specified place but don't create a line.
  - 'L' means move to a designated location and draw a line from the previous point.

4) Guide the Interpretation - Guide the model to interpret the shape as per the SVG path in relation to the options provided.
  
5) Understanding Geometry - The prompt should emphasize the importance of understanding basic geometric shapes and their properties, such as how many sides each shape has. If the model knows a hexagon has six sides, it may better recognize a drawing that includes six sequentially connected lines to form a closed shape as a hexagon.

6) Simplicity and Complexity - Clarify that the choice of geometric shape should consider both simplicity and complexity, meaning that it should select the simplest shape that could be formed by the given points but not ignoring any possible complex shapes.

7) Check Misleading Phrases - Avoid phrases that can be misleading. For instance, 'repeated points do not necessarily indicate a complex shape' might be interpreted by the model as ignoring repeated points and considering them as creating simpler shapes.

8) Choosing Option - Make sure to clearly indicate that the estimation of the shape has to align with one of the options provided.

It's important to note that language models like GPT-3 do not have knowledge about SVG paths or deep understanding about geometric shapes unless the information is provided within the prompt or the model has been trained on such data. Therefore, while incorporating these suggestions, keep in mind that the model might still need external resources for more complex SVG interpretation tasks.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START>
Given an SVG path and a set of commands to create and connect points forming a shape, you are to interpret this data to calculate the total number of distinct points and determine the geometric shape they form. You should regard each coordinate on the path as individual, even if they are repeated. Keep in mind the significance of the order and sequence of the points, and pay attention to the SVG commands, notably 'M' (move to) which implies shifting to a position without creating a line, and 'L' (line to), which commands to draw a line from the last point to the defined location. 

Use this knowledge to estimate the shape created when all unique points are connected in a sequence defined by the SVG path. Be aware of the vast possibilities of geometric shapes, from the simplest polygon to the more intricate ones, as the shape could be any of those. Understand that repeated points are not always indicative of an intricate figure.

Remember that the primary criterion for your estimation is the most plausible geometric shape that fits with both the simple and complex characteristics of the SVG path. You'll have to use your understanding of how many sides each shape usually possesses to make this prediction.

Review your estimations against the list of given geometric shapes provided in the options. Your selection must be from this list and should best represent the shape created by the SVG path. Conclude your response by stating the selected answer option enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1. Lack of SVG Path Analysis: The prompt asks the model to analyze an SVG path to identify the geometry of shape. However, it seems likely that the model doesn't have the capability to properly interpret and analyze an SVG path, leading to incorrect shape identification. 

2. Missing Information about Shape Characteristics: The prompt does not provide enough information about determining shapes. For example, it does not mention that the number of points in a shape can be indicative of the type of shape (e.g., a triangle has three points, a quadrilateral has four points).

3. Absence of Quantitative Commands: One primary reason might be the lack of explicit instruction into the prompt asking the model to count or quantify the points from the SVG path to correctly identify the shape. The example given creates a heptagon, but the model predicts it as a triangle.

4. Ambiguity in the nature of the task: There could be a possible lack of clarity on the part of the model as to what should be treated as simple or complex shape leading to incorrect predictions.

Aspects for Improvement:

1. Provide Basic SVG Instructions: Include basic instructions about analyzing SVG paths, including specifics on what kind of information can be derived from different SVG commands.

2. Breakdown of Shape Identification: Make the process of identifying shapes more explicit in the prompt by giving more information about the characteristics that can determine the shape.

3. Explicit quantitative instructions: Ask explicitly to quantify or count the points and lines from SVG paths to identify the shape correctly.

4. Greater Clarity: Define what forms a simple or complex geometric shape, providing more examples if needed can also be helpful.

5. Training the AI model: It might be beneficial to train the AI model in comprehending SVG commands or vector paths better to enable more accurate shape identifications.

Consider the sequence and order of points, as well as the directives in SVG commands like 'M' (move to) and 'L' (line to), which are crucial in constructing the lines that form the geometric shapes. Using these points and commands, estimate the total number of unique points and discern the shape they form when connected. Don't forget to look for simple shapes as well as more complex ones, as the resulting shape could potentially be any geometric figure. Also, be aware that repeated points do not necessarily indicate a complex shape. Choose the most likely geometric shape from the given answer options, considering both simplicity and complexity. Conclude with stating your answer option enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. At all times, remember that your main objective is the identification of the overall geometric figure rather than getting overwhelmed with the intricacies of path instructions and points.

The model's response is: 
The given SVG path forms a triangle. 
Therefore, the answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: J.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1. Lack of SVG Path Analysis: The prompt asks the model to analyze an SVG path to identify the geometry of shape. However, it seems likely that the model doesn't have the capability to properly interpret and analyze an SVG path, leading to incorrect shape identification. 

2. Missing Information about Shape Characteristics: The prompt does not provide enough information about determining shapes. For example, it does not mention that the number of points in a shape can be indicative of the type of shape (e.g., a triangle has three points, a quadrilateral has four points).

3. Absence of Quantitative Commands: One primary reason might be the lack of explicit instruction into the prompt asking the model to count or quantify the points from the SVG path to correctly identify the shape. The example given creates a heptagon, but the model predicts it as a triangle.

4. Ambiguity in the nature of the task: There could be a possible lack of clarity on the part of the model as to what should be treated as simple or complex shape leading to incorrect predictions.

Aspects for Improvement:

1. Provide Basic SVG Instructions: Include basic instructions about analyzing SVG paths, including specifics on what kind of information can be derived from different SVG commands.

2. Breakdown of Shape Identification: Make the process of identifying shapes more explicit in the prompt by giving more information about the characteristics that can determine the shape.

3. Explicit quantitative instructions: Ask explicitly to quantify or count the points and lines from SVG paths to identify the shape correctly.

4. Greater Clarity: Define what forms a simple or complex geometric shape, providing more examples if needed can also be helpful.

5. Training the AI model: It might be beneficial to train the AI model in comprehending SVG commands or vector paths better to enable more accurate shape identifications.

   prompt: For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure. The indication may define both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform renditions of shapes. In these SVG path instructions, "M" commands shift the drawing "pen" to an alternative point, whereas "L" commands construct a line segment from the existing position to another. Multiple "M" commands in one instruction suggest disjointed lines within the path, which can influence recognition of the overall shape. Curves are treated as straight lines for simplicity. You should evaluate the number of sequential "L" commands as the sides of the figure and the points as its vertices. Be aware, the figure sketched might not closely adhere to the standard geometric figure due to intricate aspects of the path and possible presence of disjointed lines. Examine the instructions and opt for the choice that best encapsulates the figure created by the SVG path instructions. Declare your answer by stating the designated letter of the selected option.

Remember, each "L" command signifies a straight line forming an edge of the shape, regardless of whether it connects back to the starting point or forms a free-standing line. In consideration of the potential complexity of SVG paths elements, don't be distracted by the disjointed lines; they don't affect the final geometric shape. Prioritize overall structure over minute details.

   prompt: In this task, you are required to analyze SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) path instructions to recognize the rendered geometric figure. SVG path instructions use specific commands such as "M", which moves the drawing "pen" to a different location, and "L", which forms a line segment from the current location to the cited one. Sometimes, numerous "M" commands can indicate disjointed lines within the SVG path, but these should not change your evaluation of the primary shape. Interpret curves as straight lines for simplicity.

Count the sequential "L" commands, as each represents a straight line that forms an edge of the shape. The total count of "L" commands corresponds to the sides of the geometric figure. But bear in mind, whether it connects back to the starting point or appears as a free-standing line does not alter its role as a side. However, consider only those free-standing lines that affect the overall shape and ignore the auxiliary ones.

Remember, the figure drawn may not exactly conform to a typical geometric figure due to complex aspects of the path creation and potential presence of disjointed lines. Therefore, focus your evaluation on the overall structure, minimizing the impact of minute details on your judgement.

Consider the SVG path instructions provided, identify the corresponding shape and choose a matching option from the given examples: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle.

   prompt: Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections.

   prompt: Given instructions in SVG path language, in which geometric figure they result in is to be identified. These instructions may include splines and straight lines, which could form regular or irregular versions of various geometric shapes. The command "M" is a move to a new position while "L" instructs a line to be drawn from the current position to a new one. Likewise, the path may involve "C" or "Q" commands for drawing curves which can significantly alter the resulting figure. While accounting for these curves, if the shape seems to be irregular or doesn't perfectly resemble the typical geometric shape due to the intricacies of the path, determine the closest geometric figure by focusing on the significant lines and curves. Pay attention to the number of corners which typically represents the number of sides in the figure. Consider irregular figures to be the closest matching regular geometric shapes, and bear in mind that this task is on two-dimensional shapes. Now, using your comprehension of these SVG path instructions decode the geometric figure. Respond by selecting the letter option that best describes the figure formed according to the given SVG path instructions.

   reward: 0.4800 | Q: 0.4800 | uct: 2.5614 | cum_rewards: [0.48]
   prompt: SVG path language provides instructions to create complex geometric figures using various commands. Each figure consists of an array of elements, including lines signified by "M" and "L", as well as curves indicated by "C" or "Q". The aim is to analyze these SVG path instructions and identify the resulting geometric figure. For clarity, the "M" command instructs a move to a new position to start drawing, and the "L" command designates a line to be drawn from the present position to a new one. When it comes to "C" or "Q", they denote the drawing of curves, hence the shape might have curves which greatly influence the overall form of the figure. In interpreting these lines and curves, take note that the figure formed may not strictly adhere to a conventional geometric shape due to the complexity of the SVG path, but a close approximation will suffice. Prioritize the substantial lines and curves, and observe the count of corners to get an insight into the number of sides or vertices of the shape. Also, consider an irregular figure to represent the closest common geometric figure based on its significant characteristics. This task focuses on two-dimensional geometric figures, so apply your learned understanding of these SVG path instructions to identify the closest geometric figure they represent. Provide your answer by selecting the appropriate letter from the options provided that best describes the resulting figure according to the decoded SVG path instructions.

   prompt: Given the SVG path instructions containing series of lines and curves, identify the geometric figure it represents. It's important to note that the instructions might represent both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of the shapes. Interpret the "M" commands as moving the "pen" to a new position and the "L" commands as drawing a line from the current position to a new one. The figure might not perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to the details of the path, and the number of coordinates or lines can give you a hint about the number of sides or vertices in the figure. Which of the options best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions? Answer by choosing the corresponding option letter.

   prompt: Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections. With all this information, choose the option that best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions. Give your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.

   reward: 0.4600 | Q: 0.9400 | uct: 2.7929 | cum_rewards: [0.94, 0.94]
   prompt: Given instructions in SVG path language, in which geometric figure they result in is to be identified. These instructions may include splines and straight lines, which could form regular or irregular versions of various geometric shapes. The command "M" is a move to a new position while "L" instructs a line to be drawn from the current position to a new one. Likewise, the path may involve "C" or "Q" commands for drawing curves which can significantly alter the resulting figure. While accounting for these curves, if the shape seems to be irregular or doesn't perfectly resemble the typical geometric shape due to the intricacies of the path, determine the closest geometric figure by focusing on the significant lines and curves. Pay attention to the number of corners which typically represents the number of sides in the figure. Consider irregular figures to be the closest matching regular geometric shapes, and bear in mind that this task is on two-dimensional shapes. Now, using your comprehension of these SVG path instructions decode the geometric figure. Respond by selecting the letter option that best describes the figure formed according to the given SVG path instructions.

   reward: 0.4800 | Q: 0.4800 | uct: 2.3329 | cum_rewards: [0.48, 0.48]
   prompt: SVG path language provides instructions to create complex geometric figures using various commands. Each figure consists of an array of elements, including lines signified by "M" and "L", as well as curves indicated by "C" or "Q". The aim is to analyze these SVG path instructions and identify the resulting geometric figure. For clarity, the "M" command instructs a move to a new position to start drawing, and the "L" command designates a line to be drawn from the present position to a new one. When it comes to "C" or "Q", they denote the drawing of curves, hence the shape might have curves which greatly influence the overall form of the figure. In interpreting these lines and curves, take note that the figure formed may not strictly adhere to a conventional geometric shape due to the complexity of the SVG path, but a close approximation will suffice. Prioritize the substantial lines and curves, and observe the count of corners to get an insight into the number of sides or vertices of the shape. Also, consider an irregular figure to represent the closest common geometric figure based on its significant characteristics. This task focuses on two-dimensional geometric figures, so apply your learned understanding of these SVG path instructions to identify the closest geometric figure they represent. Provide your answer by selecting the appropriate letter from the options provided that best describes the resulting figure according to the decoded SVG path instructions.

Here's an example of such a path: '59.18,98.64 - 65.20,80.96 - 57.00,68.63 - 55.43,56.00 - 55.43,56.00 - 67.76,43.69 - 67.76,43.69 - 80.38,62.66 - 92.36,80.67 - 59.18,98.64'. For simplicity, each coordinate pair is considered a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

The potential shapes that these vertices could form include:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

Visualize and analyze the SVG path, try to determine which shape, from the given list, the vertices and line segments most likely form. Provide your answer as the corresponding letter, framed between <answer> and </answer>.

For example, if your answer is triangle, you would respond as <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. However, if your answer is a circle, you would respond as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. For each question, only one response option is correct. 

Refer to the vertices and the potential shapes listed above to make your selection, and frame your answer in the prescribed format.

   prompt: You have been given a list of coordinates and line paths which form SVG paths that represent various shapes. Your task doesn't involve plotting these paths but the clues provided by number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path might help in determining the shape. 

Keeping in mind the following potential shapes, analyze the logical relationships rather than visual interpretations about them:
(A) circle, which has no vertices or line segments 
(B) heptagon, which has seven vertices and line segments 
(C) hexagon, which contains six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, formed by two pair of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, represented by just two vertices 
(F) octagon, that contains eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, composed of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, formed by four vertices and line segments, possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) sector, characterized by a curved path and two straight paths from a common vertex 
(J) triangle, it has three vertices and line segments

Based on given SVG path, deduce what the most likely shape from the given list of options might be. Your answer should be formatted as: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' is a letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the corresponding shape.

For example, if you conclude that the given SVG path is describing the vertices of a circle, you would answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>. However, if it's a triangle, you would write <answer>(J) triangle</answer>. There is only one correct response per question. 

For interpretation, consider that each coordinate pair in the SVG paths is a vertex and every two successive vertexes form a line segment.

   prompt: Given an SVG path, your goal is to logically determine the type of geometric shape it represents. You won't plot these paths, but instead, you'll use clues provided by the number of vertices, angles and line segments in the SVG path. 

For your assistance, consider that each pair of coordinates corresponds to a vertex and every two successive vertices form a line segment. Also note that the order of vertices in the SVG path is important, because it reveals the order in which the line segments are connected.

Here are potential shapes and their specifics you can refer to:
(A) circle, doesn't have any vertices or line segments
(B) heptagon, contains seven vertices and line segments
(C) hexagon, has six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, is formed by two pairs of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, is represented by just two vertices
(F) octagon, possesses eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, is comprised of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, has four vertices and line segments with equal opposite sides
(I) sector, known by a curved path and two straight paths sharing a common vertex
(J) triangle, has three vertices and line segments

Once you determine the most likely shape the given SVG path corresponds to from the above range of options, format your response as: <answer>(Letter) Shape</answer>, where 'Letter' corresponds to the letter from A to J and 'Shape' is the name of the inferred shape.

For example, if you determine the given SVG path describes a circle, you should answer as <answer>(A) circle</answer>, or if it's a kite, your answer should be <answer>(D) kite</answer>. Remember, there's only one correct response for each question.

   prompt: Given the SVG path instructions, your task is to identify the geometric figure it represents. The instructions may contain lines and curves that trace both regular (equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of geometrical shapes. Consider that the "M" command moves the "pen" to a new position, and the "L" command draws a line from the current location to a new one. Additionally, the path can also include "C" or "Q" commands, which denominate the drawing of curves. These curves can drastically change the figure, so account for them correctly while discerning the shape. Note that an irregular version of a shape or a figure that doesn't perfectly resemble the geometric shape due to path details can still be classified as a particular figure, focusing on the predominant lines and curves instead of minor imperfections. With all this information, choose the option that best describes the created shape according to the SVG path instructions. Give your answer by selecting the corresponding option letter.

   prompt: Given SVG path instructions, your task is to discern what geometric figure they represent. This can include conventional shapes with equal sides and angles, as well as irregular variations. Focus on the "M" and "L" commands in the instructions. Interpret the "M" commands as instructions to position the 'pen' at a new point, and "L" commands as directives to draw a line from the current position to a new one. Note that there might be multiple "M" commands in single SVG path instructions. In such case, treat each new "M" command as continuation from another vertex in the same geometric figure, not a separate shape. Consider the number of lines and coordinates that make up each side to give you a clue about the number of sides or vertices in the geometric shape. Understand that the shape may not fully comply with the traditional geometric figure due to the nuances within the path, and it is your ability to perceive beyond the evident that will aid in correctly identifying the shape with its options. Pick the option that closest describes the geometric figure according to the SVG path instructions and answer with the corresponding letter.

   prompt: You're given a set of SVG path instructions, which are employed to outline a geometric figure. Your task is to determine what geometric shape is created by these commands. Bear in mind that the shape could be either regular (all sides and angles are equal) or irregular (the sides and angles may differ). The SVG path instructions utilize the "M" command to reposition the "pen" and the "L" command to draw a straight line from the current point to a new one. In cases when multiple "M" commands exist in a single instruction, realize it represents disjointed lines in the path. For this exercise, even a curve in the path is considered as a straight line, for simplicity. Each "L" command represents an edge of our geometric shape. Count the number of edges (lines) to deduce the shape. The vertices are to be considered as corners of the shape. Understand, due to the intricacies of the path, the figure might not be an ideal representation of the geometric shape. Choose the option that most accurately outlines the shape formed by the SVG path instructions. Provide your answer by selecting the option letter. Keep the complexity of individual shapes in mind as the path might not form a perfectly regular version. Always select an option that best fits the description given by SVG path instructions. 

Here's an example to illustrate: if we have four "L" commands only, we interpret it as a rectangle or a square, not a triangle nor a circle. The total count of lines (edges) helps determine the figure. If we have an extra "M" command or a disjointed line, consider it as a part of the overall shape, and not a separate entity.

Please aim to figure out the shape from the SVG path, choosing the best option letter match, and bracket your answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: For this task, you are to decode an SVG path instruction that sketches a geometric figure. The indication may define both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform renditions of shapes. In these SVG path instructions, "M" commands shift the drawing "pen" to an alternative point, whereas "L" commands construct a line segment from the existing position to another. Multiple "M" commands in one instruction suggest disjointed lines within the path, which can influence recognition of the overall shape. Curves are treated as straight lines for simplicity. You should evaluate the number of sequential "L" commands as the sides of the figure and the points as its vertices. Be aware, the figure sketched might not closely adhere to the standard geometric figure due to intricate aspects of the path and possible presence of disjointed lines. Examine the instructions and opt for the choice that best encapsulates the figure created by the SVG path instructions. Declare your answer by stating the designated letter of the selected option.

Remember, each "L" command signifies a straight line forming an edge of the shape, regardless of whether it connects back to the starting point or forms a free-standing line. In consideration of the potential complexity of SVG paths elements, don't be distracted by the disjointed lines; they don't affect the final geometric shape. Prioritize overall structure over minute details.

Now, interpret the SVG path instructions provided and choose a corresponding option: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle.

   prompt: Using the SVG path instructions provided, your task is to ascertain the geometric figure depicted. Remember, the SVG path instructions represent geometric figures that might be regular (with equal sides and angles) and irregular. In these instructions, an "M" command refers to moving the "pen" to a new position, while an "L" command signifies drawing a straight line from the current position to another. If you encounter multiple "M" commands in one instruction, treat them as disjointed lines in the overall figure and do not let these change your overall edge count. Additionally, if you come across a curve in the path, count it as a straight line for simplicity. Remember to count the number of "L" commands as these define the number of edges, and therefore, the shape. Note: the specific SVG path details might not form a perfect geometric figure. Your task is to identify the closest approximation. Choose the most fitting description of the shape created by the SVG path instructions from the given options and provide your answer by indicating the corresponding option letter. Apply the rule: match the count of "L" commands to the number of edges of a geometric figure in your shape identification. For example, if there are 5 "L" commands, the figure could be a pentagon, if there are 3, it could be a triangle, and so on.

   prompt: In this task, you will decode SVG path instructions to identify a geometric figure. The instructions may draw both uniform (equal sides and angles) and non-uniform shapes. A SVG path instruction begins with "M" commands that shift the drawing "pen" to an initial point, and "L" commands thereafter construct a line segment from the existing point to a new one. Remember, every "L" command signifies a straight line that forms an edge of a shape. If multiple "M" commands exist in one instruction, it suggests that there are disjointed lines within the path, but these disjointed lines do not affect the overall shape of the figure, instead they might indicate complexities within the shape. Also, curves are considered as straight lines for simplicity.

A key point to consider is that the quantity of sequential "L" commands does not always correspond to the sides of the figure due to complex path structures or existence of disjointed lines. Therefore, look at the SVG path instructions holistically and choose the option that best describes the entire figure sketched. Although the shape might not strictly adhere to a standard geometric figure because of intricate aspects of the path, your objective is to identify the general structure rather than focusing on minute details.

Now, with the given SVG path instructions, what geometric figure does it most resemble: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle? Present your answer as: <answer>(Your Chosen Option)</answer>.

Please note that, one SVG path instruction example is as follows, "M X1,Y1 L X2,Y2 L X3,Y3", where X and Y are coordinates. Here, "M X1,Y1" moves the pen to point (X1,Y1), and "L X2,Y2" and "L X3,Y3" draw straight lines from the end of the previous line to points (X2,Y2) and (X3,Y3) respectively.

   prompt: For this task, you are tasked with explaining the effects of specific SVG path instructions. In SVG, the "M" commands move the drawing "pen" to a novel point without creating any lines, whereas the "L" commands construct a straight line segment from the currently designated location to an alternate one. You may also encounter multiple "M" commands within one instruction, signifying disjointed lines within the path. In its rudimentary form, even a curve can be treated like a straight line to keep things simple. Now, imagine a designer who knows nothing about SVG path instructions. Explain to them what would happen if they used the "M" command followed by multiple "L" commands consecutively. What form would they see on their screen?

Please remember to present your explanation in simple and comprehensible language, avoiding any technical jargon that may confuse the designer. After giving your explanation, format it as follows: <explanation>(Your Explaination Here)</explanation>.

   prompt: In this task, you are required to analyze SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) path instructions to recognize the rendered geometric figure. SVG path instructions use specific commands such as "M", which moves the drawing "pen" to a different location, and "L", which forms a line segment from the current location to the cited one. Sometimes, numerous "M" commands can indicate disjointed lines within the SVG path, but these should not change your evaluation of the primary shape. Interpret curves as straight lines for simplicity.

Count the sequential "L" commands, as each represents a straight line that forms an edge of the shape. The total count of "L" commands corresponds to the sides of the geometric figure. But bear in mind, whether it connects back to the starting point or appears as a free-standing line does not alter its role as a side. However, consider only those free-standing lines that affect the overall shape and ignore the auxiliary ones.

Remember, the figure drawn may not exactly conform to a typical geometric figure due to complex aspects of the path creation and potential presence of disjointed lines. Therefore, focus your evaluation on the overall structure, minimizing the impact of minute details on your judgement.

Consider the SVG path instructions provided, identify the corresponding shape and choose a matching option from the given examples: (A) circle, (B) heptagon, (C) hexagon, (D) kite, (E) line, (F) octagon, (G) pentagon, (H) rectangle, (I) sector, (J) triangle.

   prompt: By interpreting the SVG path instructions provided, determine the geometric shape being represented. Both regular (with equal sides and angles) and irregular versions of shapes may be present. Keep in mind the following directives: "M" moves the drawing "pen" to a new position, "L" draws a line from the current point to a new one, whereas "C" and "Q" denote the drawing of curves. The interpretation of these commands is crucial in identifying the shape. Unexpected curves may considerably modify a geometric figure, so ensure they are correctly accounted for. Remember, a shape does not need to be a flawless representation of a geometric figure to be classified as such. Instead, it's the major recurring elements we are interested in, not small anomalies or irregularities. Drawing from your understanding of these SVG path commands, determine which of the given options best corresponds to the shape formed, using the option letters to register your answer. In the case of an SVG that traces an irregular figure, choose the geometric form it most closely emulates.

   prompt: Given instructions in SVG path language, in which geometric figure they result in is to be identified. These instructions may include splines and straight lines, which could form regular or irregular versions of various geometric shapes. The command "M" is a move to a new position while "L" instructs a line to be drawn from the current position to a new one. Likewise, the path may involve "C" or "Q" commands for drawing curves which can significantly alter the resulting figure. While accounting for these curves, if the shape seems to be irregular or doesn't perfectly resemble the typical geometric shape due to the intricacies of the path, determine the closest geometric figure by focusing on the significant lines and curves. Pay attention to the number of corners which typically represents the number of sides in the figure. Consider irregular figures to be the closest matching regular geometric shapes, and bear in mind that this task is on two-dimensional shapes. Now, using your comprehension of these SVG path instructions decode the geometric figure. Respond by selecting the letter option that best describes the figure formed according to the given SVG path instructions.

   prompt: This task requires you to interpret SVG path instructions and identify the geometric shape they depict. These instructions may represent both regular and irregular shapes. Regular shapes have equal sides and angles, while irregular shapes do not. The SVG path can contain commands like 'M', 'L', 'C', and 'Q. 'M' commands dictate moving the pen to a new location, while 'L' commands signify drawing a line from the current spot to a new one. 'C' and 'Q' commands, on the other hand, designate the addition of curves. Handling these curves appropriately is crucial, as they can significantly alter the shape's appearance. It's essential to remember that an imperfect or irregular shape can still be grouped under a particular figure, provided the primary lines and curves dominant. To ascertain the shape, you should focus on the major visual attributes rather than minor anomalies. Interpret the SVG commands step-by-step to build a mental image of the geometric figure. The number of 'M' and 'L' commands might give you a hint about the shape's sides or vertices. Therefore, your task is to analyze each component of the SVG path instructions to determine the geometric figure they represent. Once you've figured out the shape, select the corresponding option letter from the choices provided.

   prompt: In this task, you will be given SVG path instructions, and your objective is to identify the resulting geometric figure. Be aware that these SVG path instructions could include line elements "L" and move elements "M", along with curve elements "C" and "Q", constructing both regular and irregular forms of shapes. "M" stands for a change in position, while "L" indicates the drawing of a line. Curves, marked by "C" or "Q", can drastically influence the final shape. Your role is to comprehend these instructions well enough to discern whether the result resembles a known geometric figure, even if not perfectly. Look out for dominant lines and curves, which provide clues about the shape, despite any irregularities or complexities in the path. Especially, be mindful of the number of distinct corners, which often corresponds to the number of sides in a figure.

   prompt: Your task is to identify a two-dimensional geometric figure based on instructions written in SVG path language. These instructions might include straight lines, represented by the "M" and "L" commands, where "M" moves the "pen" to a new position and "L" signifies a line to be drawn from the current position to another. Commands "C" or "Q" are used to draw curves, and the inclusion of these commands can significantly impact the final shape of the figure. Consequently, the final figure may not perfectly match a typical geometric shape but can be considered as the closest match. In such cases, focus on the predominant lines and curves rather than minor variations. If the figure appears irregular, judge it as the closest matching regular geometric shape. The number of corners formed usually indicates the number of sides in the shape. Guided by these instructions, examine the given SVG path and select the letter option that best matches the geometric figure. Remember, this task concerns only two-dimensional shapes.

   prompt: SVG path language provides instructions to create complex geometric figures using various commands. Each figure consists of an array of elements, including lines signified by "M" and "L", as well as curves indicated by "C" or "Q". The aim is to analyze these SVG path instructions and identify the resulting geometric figure. For clarity, the "M" command instructs a move to a new position to start drawing, and the "L" command designates a line to be drawn from the present position to a new one. When it comes to "C" or "Q", they denote the drawing of curves, hence the shape might have curves which greatly influence the overall form of the figure. In interpreting these lines and curves, take note that the figure formed may not strictly adhere to a conventional geometric shape due to the complexity of the SVG path, but a close approximation will suffice. Prioritize the substantial lines and curves, and observe the count of corners to get an insight into the number of sides or vertices of the shape. Also, consider an irregular figure to represent the closest common geometric figure based on its significant characteristics. This task focuses on two-dimensional geometric figures, so apply your learned understanding of these SVG path instructions to identify the closest geometric figure they represent. Provide your answer by selecting the appropriate letter from the options provided that best describes the resulting figure according to the decoded SVG path instructions.

   prompt: Given a sequence of coordinates represented as SVG path, use the information to analyze the potential vertices and angles. Note that these line paths can be concerning shapes more complex than primary geometric ones.

We have simplified your task by narrowing down the potential shapes that could be related to these coordinates. The categories are:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon

   prompt: Given a path represented in SVG format, your task is to identify the shape being drawn. For every SVG path, assume that each pair of coordinates represents a unique vertex. Two successive vertices form a line segment and together, these line segments form the shape in question. Remember that in SVG paths, 'M' signals the start of a new sub-path and 'L' indicates a line segment to the next set of coordinates. The shapes could range from simple to complex geometrical forms.

(C) hexagon, has six vertices and line segments
(D) kite, is formed by two pairs of line segments of equal length sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) line, is represented by just two vertices
(F) octagon, possesses eight vertices and line segments
(G) pentagon, is comprised of five vertices and line segments
(H) rectangle, has four vertices and line segments with equal opposite sides
(I) sector, known by a curved path and two straight paths sharing a common vertex

(D) Kite, constructed from two pairs of equal length line segments sharing two consecutive vertices
(E) Line, represented by merely two vertices
(F) Octagon, containing eight vertices and line segments
(G) Pentagon, consisting of five vertices and line segments
(H) Rectangle, constructed with four vertices and line segments and possessing equal opposite sides 
(I) Sector, distinguished by a curved path and two straight paths sharing a common vertex 
(J) Triangle, encompassing three vertices and line segments

You are to deduce, relying solely on the logical interpretations and not visual insights, the potential shape being represented by the provided SVG path. Your answer should be structured as follows: <answer> (Letter) Shape</answer>, where the 'Letter' corresponds to the letter from A to J depicting the shape, and 'Shape' is the name of the corresponding shape itself.

You should treat each coordinate in the path as a unique point, even if it appears multiple times. Consider the sequence and order of points, as well as the directives in SVG commands like 'M' (move to) and 'L' (line to), which are crucial in constructing the lines that form the geometric shapes. Using these points and commands, estimate the total number of unique points and discern the shape they form when connected. Don't forget to look for simple shapes as well as more complex ones, as the resulting shape could potentially be any geometric figure. Also, be aware that repeated points do not necessarily indicate a complex shape. Choose the most likely geometric shape from the given answer options, considering both simplicity and complexity. Conclude with stating your answer option enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. At all times, remember that your main objective is the identification of the overall geometric figure rather than getting overwhelmed with the intricacies of path instructions and points.

   prompt: Considering an SVG path composed of commands for plotting points, you are called upon to deftly interpret these path instructions. Disregard any repeated coordinate and treat each unique point singularly. Take into account the sequence and order of points as per SVG commands like M (move to) and L (line to) which form the building blocks for various geometric shapes. All points and SVG instructions need to be scrupulously analyzed to precisely assess the total count of distinctive points. With this data at hand, strive to identify an array of geometric forms, ranging from elementary to intricate, or those constructed from multiple components. In attempting to discern the shape, do not let common shapes overshadow less common ones, as the SVG path may denote a complex or compound shape. The objective is to meticulously conclude about the geometric shape represented by these points, considering the whole and not just parts. Your tentative shape suggestion should then be matched from the provided answer options, reflecting the most probable shape that emerges from the composed points. Conclude with your final answer, framed distinctly between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Given an SVG path, which includes commands for determining points and creating lines, carefully interpret these commands. Remember that a specific coordinate counts as one distinct point, even if it is repeated within the path. Apart from the SVG commands such as M (move to) and L (line to), which dictate the pathway for connecting the points, pay special attention to the order and sequence of these points in forming the lines and ultimately the geometric shape. Analyze all points, the route taken from point to point as dictated by the SVG instructions, and the unique characteristics of the lines created. With this information, make an effort to identify both simple and more intricate geometric shapes, as well as composite shapes consisting of multiple parts. Consider not only the total number of unique points but also the manner in which these points are connected, the angles created, the sides formed, and the overall structure of the path. Your objective is to accurately determine the geometric shape constructed from these points and lines. Base your judgment on the answer options provided. Finally, provide your answer option placed within the <answer> and </answer> brackets.

   prompt: You are given an SVG path, composed of commands that plot points to form a shape. Each coordinate within the path corresponds to a unique point, even if it appears more than once. Take into account the sequence and order of these points, and directives in SVG commands like 'M' (move to) and 'L' (line to), essential for forming the lines of geometric shapes. Analyze all the points and commands, to estimate the total number of unique points and identify the shape they form when connected. Keep in mind that the resulting shape can be a simple geometric figure as well as a complex one. Repeated points do not always signify a complex shape. Your ultimate task is to identify the overall geometric figure that the SVG path plots. Based on your analysis, select the most appropriate geometric shape from the given list, without giving excessive importance to the simplicity or complexity of the shape. In your conclusion, provide your chosen answer mediated within <answer> and </answer>, ensuring the correct alphabet corresponding to the option is included. Remember, accurately deducing the shape is the key goal of this task, without being sidetracked by the individual details of SVG path instructions and points.

   prompt: Given an SVG path and a set of commands to create and connect points forming a shape, you are to interpret this data to calculate the total number of distinct points and determine the geometric shape they form. You should regard each coordinate on the path as individual, even if they are repeated. Keep in mind the significance of the order and sequence of the points, and pay attention to the SVG commands, notably 'M' (move to) which implies shifting to a position without creating a line, and 'L' (line to), which commands to draw a line from the last point to the defined location. 

Use this knowledge to estimate the shape created when all unique points are connected in a sequence defined by the SVG path. Be aware of the vast possibilities of geometric shapes, from the simplest polygon to the more intricate ones, as the shape could be any of those. Understand that repeated points are not always indicative of an intricate figure.

Remember that the primary criterion for your estimation is the most plausible geometric shape that fits with both the simple and complex characteristics of the SVG path. You'll have to use your understanding of how many sides each shape usually possesses to make this prediction.

Review your estimations against the list of given geometric shapes provided in the options. Your selection must be from this list and should best represent the shape created by the SVG path. Conclude your response by stating the selected answer option enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags. Keep in focus that your main objective is always to identify the overall geometric shape, avoiding getting overwhelmed with the specificities of SVG path instructions and points.

   prompt: In the SVG path command sequence that will be provided, your primary task is to dissect the information to discern the geometry of the figure being drawn. SVG commands like 'M' (move to), 'L' (line to) and others are used to form different lines that together constitute the overall geometrical figure. Carefully consider every point on this SVG path command, each command's attributes and the sequence of the points while treating each coordinate as unique, even multiple-occurring ones. To correctly identify the shape being drawn, enumerate the total number of unique points derived from the command sequence. Be sure to explore both simple shapes like triangles, circles, or squares, as well as multifaceted shapes such as complex polygons or compound shapes created from numerous parts. Consider that repetitive points might not always symbolize a complex shape. Based on these specific clues and the shape's unique characteristics, select the answer that you believe best describes the figure from the given answer options. Justify your choice based on principles of simplicity and complexity as seen in the path command. Present your final choice surrounded by <answer> and </answer>. Your principal goal should center around the accurate identification of the main geometric figure formed by the SVG path command, without getting buried in the details of each individual point or command.
