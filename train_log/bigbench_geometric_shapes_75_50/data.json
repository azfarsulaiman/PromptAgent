For instance, a path with three points might represent a triangle or a kite, depending on how the points are connected.

You are required to conduct an exhaustive analysis of all the data points of the path, including start and end points, as well as the ones in between.

As a guide, remember a circle (A) is usually represented by a single unique vertex linked by an 'A' command, a straight line (E) can have only two unique vertices connected by an 'L' command, and the rest of the shapes necessarily involve multiple points linked by either 'L' or a combination of 'L' and 'A' commands.",

'M' is used to move the pen to a new location without drawing anything. 'L' draws straight line segments between distinct vertices but does not imply that the overall shape is a line. 'A' forms possible curvature or arcs. Deduce the total count of unique vertices in your evaluation, ensuring that same point revisits are not counted twice. From these commands and the connecting patterns they form (lines or arcs), visualize the possible shape. Contemplate shapes that can be closed, where the last vertex connects to the initial vertex according to the commands. Evaluate four key points to assist you: (a) A circle usually involves a single unique vertex linked by an 'A', (b) a line should have only two unique vertices linked by 'L', (c) complex shapes involve multiple points connected by 'L' or a mix of 'L' and 'A' commands, and (d) the sequence or pattern of 'L', 'M', and 'A' commands may provide clues to the shape.

Like, a command comprising of just two points forms a line (E). Commands with three vertices may form a triangle (J). On the other hand, four or more vertices without any arcs could lead to a square, rectangle (H) or more complex shapes like (C) hexagon, (F) octagon, or (G) pentagon depending on the command sequence. Remember, the complexity increases with addition of vertices\u2014it can be more than just a line.",

            "prompt": "Your objective is to interpret SVG path commands that map onto geometric shapes as drawn by an artist. Carefully examine the SVG path commands which will either depict a simple line or a multi-sided polygon. The 'M' command indicates a move to a different point without drawing a line, whereas the 'L' command involves drawing a line from the current location to a new location. It's important to note that using a series of 'M' and 'L' commands, the artist could illustrate a multitude of complex polygons. It's crucial that you meticulously count the number of points described within the SVG path, as this is key in determining the type of geometric figure. Avoid the temptation to overlook or oversimplify intricate designs. Based on the SVG path commands and the mentioned points, deduce the artist's intended geometric shape. Bearing in mind the range of possible polygons, from triangles to octagons, and ensuring to avoid a bias towards any one shape, choose the most accurate match from the provided list. Frame your answer in the format: <answer>(Option) Shape</answer>, where 'Option' corresponds to the letter linking to the correct geometric shape. In delivering this task, a sound understanding of SVG path commands and their relationship to geometric shapes is essential. Keep in mind that the final shape may not be the simplest interpretation.",

Each command guides the actions: 'M' (moveto) moves the pen to a new location without drawing a line, and 'L' (lineto) draws a line from the current location to a new one. Remember that these commands can construct complex multi-sided polygons as well as simple lines.
