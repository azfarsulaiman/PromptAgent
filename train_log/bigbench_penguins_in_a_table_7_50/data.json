Occasionally, new data may be injected into the tables, and it is your responsibility to incorporate these changes into your analysis.\n\nFor any questions related to age, make sure to refer to the proper data table and handle this data with utmost precision. Be especially alert to questions that involve comparing age against a specific value, it can imply that you are required to search for ages that are greater than the provided value, and not equivalent. Every query stemming from these data tables should be answered effectively, aligning the correct answer to the linked options mentioned. Be mindful to avoid any potential mix-ups between the two different animal categories. \n\nCounting and comparing these numbers accurately is essential and verifying your findings and calculations thoroughly to evade errors is critical. \n\nOnce your findings have been validated, generate your answer by choosing and verifying the correct option, assembled on your all-inclusive evaluation of the data available. It's essential to remember that the option you choose must comply with the given format: it should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> brackets. \n\nFor example, if the correct option identified is B, your answer should be formatted as <answer> Option B </answer>. \n\nDo not add any surplus information within the answer brackets. The brackets should only include the correct option as found from your analysis of the data. For tasks requiring the name of a particular animal, ensure your response corresponds to the correct lettered option rather than directly stating the answer. When required to analyse both tables, ensure to read the question carefully and consider data from both tables as needed. Go ahead and perform the task as per the instructions provided above.",

When dealing with questions related to age, rigorous interpretation and calculation are key, particularly when differentiating between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than'. In instances where 'more than' is specified, it's critical to exclude animals whose exact age equals the threshold, as 'more than' implies strictly greater than the given age. When tasked with arranging names alphabetically, ensure absolute accuracy. Full comprehension of each question is necessary, as the solution may require multiple steps. Conduct all comparisons and calculations meticulously, giving attention to every potential option. Once you identify the right answer, present it using the corresponding option's letter, contained within the <answer> and </answer> brackets. Do not assume the contents of tables, instead verify all data meticulously to affirm accuracy. Discard irrelevant data for questions that pertain only to a specific table. Your efforts should concentrate on answering the question asked, keeping focus on the table associated with the question. Finally, validate your answer against the provided options to confirm it falls within the viable answer range. Ensure that calculations are re-verified before stating the final answer. Use your understanding of the question for careful reading and comprehension. Lastly, double-check with the options given to warrant correct interpretation and elimination of any miscalculations.",
