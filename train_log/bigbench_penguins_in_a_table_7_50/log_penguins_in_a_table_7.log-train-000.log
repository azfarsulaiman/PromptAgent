Answer questions about causal attribution
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. 
Therefore, the answer is <(D) 4>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
The model's answer: There are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old. 
Therefore, the answer is <(D) 4>.
Correct answer: C (3 penguins)

The issues with this wrong response:

- Inaccuracy in information extraction: The task does not relate to causal attribution at all. The prompt, therefore, is unclear and irrelevant to the task of data extraction from the table provided. The language model was supposed to extract information from the table about the ages of the penguins and calculate how many of them were more than 5 years old. Instead, due to the incorrect instructions, the model incorrectly identified all 4 penguins as being older than 5 years old.

- Incorrect calculation: In addition to the misinterpretation of the information, the model also miscalculates the number of penguins who are over 5 years old. According to the data table, there are only 3 penguins over 5 years old, yet the model's response suggests that there are 4. This shows an error in data processing.

- Misalignment between the prompt and task: The prompt asks to answer questions about causal attribution, but the task is unrelated to this type of questioning. The task actually requires data extraction and computation from tabular data, not causal attribution. This misalignment can lead to incorrect output from the model.

Recommendations for improving the prompt:

- Align the prompt with the task: Clearly state the nature of the task in the prompt. For example, in this case, the task is to extract and process information from a table data, not causal attribution. Thus, aligning the prompt with the expected task would lead to better predictions.

- Include clear instructions: Make sure to provide sufficient context and specificity in the instructions. Since the task includes data extraction and decision-making, it would be beneficial to include these elements in the prompt.

- Provide explicit directives: The tasks not only require the model to extract data from a table but also to answer a question based on this data. It would, therefore, be beneficial to incorporate these directives more explicitly into the prompt. For example, "Answer the question based on the data provided in the table". 

A suggested improved prompt: 

"Extract relevant information from the provided table data and answer the questions accurately. Display the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end."

gradient:
Examining the given examples, the model's error seems to be a result of a misunderstanding of the tables provided or inability to correctly parse data from the tables. The model may have counted all animals when it was asked for only those that are more than 5 years old. This might have occurred due to ambiguity in the prompt related to handling information from tables.

Wrong Answer Reasoning:

Step 1: Interpretation of original prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution". 
This generally refers to explaining why a particular event or action happened based on the antecedent circumstances or conditions. However, in the example given, the questions are related to the data given in the table and do not involve causal attributions. The model could have misunderstood the nature of the task due to the misdirection in the original prompt.

Step 2: The model’s ability to comprehend tables
The model might not have been able to interpret the data from the tables correctly, or it could have miscounted the number of animals above 5 years old.

Step 3: The model incorrectly answered "C" instead of "A"
The model's response shows an incorrect count of animals more than 5 years old. There are five such animals, but the model calculated seven which indicates a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of data and the question.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Specify the nature of questions: The prompt should be more specific about the fact that the task involves answering questions based on data from tables. 

2. Data interpretation: The prompt should state explicitly that the language model needs to correctly interpret and use data from tables to answer questions. 

3. Test counting and comparing numbers: The model needs to be tested for its ability to count and compare numbers correctly. The prompt can include this aspect.

4. Handling of age-related data: The prompt could guide the model to handle age data correctly - for example, specifying that animals with age above a certain number should be counted.

5. Mention about answer formatting: The prompt should make it clear that the answer needs to be provided in a specific format – bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

<1> Incorrect interpretation of task. The model was asked to answer questions about "causal attribution", which relates to understanding the causes of behaviors or outcomes. However, in the provided input, the task instead involved analyzing data tables and then making a numerical count of animals based on age. This could suggest that the model misunderstood the type of task it was being asked to do. Moreover, the model counted incorrectly when determining the total number of animals over the age of 5 - it included all the penguins and giraffes from both table, which led to the wrong answer, 7 (option C), rather than the correct response of 5 (option A). 

<2> Misinterpretation of the same prompt. Again, the question pertains to analyzing data in a table and counting the number of penguins over a certain age, rather than about "causal attribution". This time, the model made a counting mistake by including all the penguins, leading it to choose option D, "4", instead of the correct answer, option C, "3".

Aspect of Improvement:

1. Ambiguity: The main problem seems to be the misalignment of the prompt with the task. The tasks involved are essentially about numerical analysis and counting, but the language model is being told to answer questions about causal attribution, implying the model should be identifying reasons behind events or behaviours, which is not relevant to the data tables it's given. The prompt should clearly state what the task is about.

2. Task understanding: The model needs to correctly understand the tasks it's given and answer accordingly. The tasks involve counting, not causal attribution, so the prompt needs to instruct the model correctly. For example, "Count the number of animals/penguins in the data tables who conform to this criterion:" would be more appropriate.

3. Accuracy: The model needs to accurately process the data it's being given and answer accordingly. This involves correctly interpreting the data and accurately counting the relevant items. To address this, the prompt could encourage step-by-step analysis or verification of the conclusions drawn.

4. Contextual alignment: The prompt has to be aligned with the subsequent question - in this case, data interpretation instead of causal attribution - so that the responses are contextually accurate.

Overall, the prompt should clearly direct the model to 'analyze the provided data and answer the numerical questions based on it'.

Example 1:

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Wrong Answer: (E) James
Correct Answer: (C) Vincent
Model's Prediction: (E) James

Reasonation:
This wrong prediction might be because the name "James" was included in the options but it wasn't listed in the table. The task given in the prompt wasn't understood correctly by the model. It fails to recognize that the options only pertain to the data given in the table, not outside it. This indicates that the model doesn't have any inherent understanding that the choice "James" wasn't part of the original data. 

Additionally, the instructions in the prompt about interpreting the data might've been too complex or ambiguous for the AI.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Simplify the instructions: The prompt should be designed in a simpler way which makes it clear that answers can only be derived from information that appears in the table. 

2. Include specific direction: The model needs instructions to know that the options provided are only relevant if the names appear in the provided table of data.

3. Unrelated data: Ensure that unrelated data or red herrings, such as unlabeled figures, need to be disregarded by the model.

4. Alphabetical understanding: The model needs to fully understand sorting names in alphabetical order. 

5. Clearer format: Request the model to output answers in a more clear format, for instance, <answer>(Option) Name</answer>

6. Extraneous data: Direct the model to ignore data that isn't asked about in the question (i.e., age, height, and weight in this case)

1. Wrong Example Analysis:

Question: What is the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

The model's response was: <answer>(C) Vincent</answer>. The correct answer was (D) Gwen.

Possible reasons for the model's incorrect response could be:

a) Complex Input: The model had to interpret data from two tables, one for penguins and another for giraffes. It might have had difficulty switching context between the two tables and could have mixed data points.

b) Misinterpretation of Data: The model could have incorrectly interpreted the height data. It might have mixed up height data points between animals.

c) Incorrect Mapping: The model might have incorrectly mapped the height data with the names of the animals. Thus, it selected Vincent instead of Gwen, who is actually 70cm tall.

To improve the prompt:

1. Specify Data: Clearly differentiate between the two categories of animals. Indicate that the model should handle data from each table separately and should not combine or confuse them.

2. Simplify Task: Ensure that the task is not too convoluted. Instead of having both age-related and non-age-related tasks together, separate them for better clarity.

3. Indicate Attention to Detail: Stress on the need to pay particular attention to detail while interpreting data and mapping it correctly with the options provided.

4. Simplify Answer Format: While the current answer format is not necessarily troublesome, simplifying it or providing a clear example of the expected output could prove beneficial for the model's comprehension. 

Revised Prompt:

Interpret data from tables containing information regarding two categories of animals - penguins and giraffes. Analyze the age, height, and weight of each animal separately and carefully within each category. Pay specific attention to correctly count and compare these numbers. If there is an age-related data question, handle it accurately. Choose the correct answer from the options provided by properly mapping it with the data. Please output the answer in this format: <answer> Option </answer>.

gradient:
Example 1:
In this example, the model was instructed to interpret data tables, focusing on age, height, and weight of animals. Although it correctly interpreted the data, it did not correctly answer the question "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?", which is indeed an age-related question, asked in a count format. The model made an error in counting the penguins. The correct answer to "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?" is option (C) 3, but the model picked (D) 4.

The mistake could be because the model misinterpreted the question about age or simply made a calculation mistake. It picked the total number of penguins instead of the number of those over 5.

Example 2:
In the second example, the model needed to interpret names and their order of mention in the tables. The accurate answer to "What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?" should be option (C) Vincent. But the model picked (E) James.

Here the problem seems to be that the model has considered an incorrect range of options, or failed to understand the 'alphabetic order' condition properly.

Ways to improve the prompt:
1. Specify that the model should assess the full range of available data and options.
2. Make explicit the requirement that the model needs to understand the given question in the prompt correctly.
3. Include a request that the model should verify its interpretation and calculations.
4. More clarification may be needed for the model about how the options correspond to information contained in the tables.
5. The prompt should instruct the model to consider all conditions in the question, like 'alphabetic order', 'more than' etc. It should be pointed out that this is crucial to deliver the correct output.
6. The prompt should mention that the command or question in a task may entail several steps for execution or resolution.

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

Model's Response: There are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old. 
<answer> Option (D) 4 </answer>

Correct Label: C
Model's Prediction: D

Analysis: The question asked the model to count how many penguins are more than 5 years old. According to the table, there were 3 penguins who fit this criterion (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen). However, the model erroneously counted Bernard as well, whose age is exactly 5, not "more than 5".

Reasons:
1. Ambiguity in understanding the extent of numerical operators: The model interpreted "more than 5" as "5 and above", thus counting the penguin aged 5, which led to the incorrect answer. This implies a misunderstanding in mathematical expressions.
   
2. Lack of precision in data manipulation: Even with general interpretation of the prompt "how many penguins are more than 5 years old?", the model should correctly exclude those penguins which are exactly 5 years old.

Improvements:
1. Improve the understanding of mathematical expressions: Ensure the prompt interpretation of "more than", "less than", "equal to", and other numerical operators align with their precise mathematical meanings.
  
2. Emphasize accurate data interpretation: Make sure the model understands the necessity of accurate data handling, including the exclusion of data points that do not fit the criteria exactly.
   
3. Provide explicit examples for conditional counting: To further clarify this point, it might be beneficial to include explicit language that underscores this, for instance, "when counting the penguins that are more than 5 years old, ensure that penguins who are exactly 5 years old are not counted".

4. Clear directives for values exactly on the boundary: In the case of age thresholds or other quantifiable aspects, clear instructions about how to treat values that lie exactly on the boundary point can prevent errors. For example, clarify whether "more than 5 years old" should include or exclude an entity that is 'exactly' 5 years old.
   
With these improvements, the model can better understand and respond to the specific requirements of the task.

<1> 

This question asks the model "How many animals are more than 5 years old?" and the answer options provide numbers that the model has to map correctly. The correct answer is A, 5. Yet, the model's output is B, 6. 

Looking at the given tables:

From the penguin table:
Louis aged 7
Bernard aged 5
Vincent aged 9
Gwen aged 8

From the giraffe table:
Jody aged 5
Gladys aged 10
Donna aged 9

Animals that are more than 5 years old are Louis, Vincent, Gwen, Gladys, and Donna. So, the correct answer is 5, option A. 

From the prompt, it's not clear that the model needs to make a selection from the answer options. The model may be calculating a value and then selecting the option that seems closest. In this case, the prompt should be clearer that the model needs to select an answer from those given based on its analysis, not to calculate a value and then make a selection.

<2> 

The question is "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?" and the model responded with the option D, 4, while the correct answer is C, 3.

From the penguin table:
Louis aged 7
Bernard aged 5
Vincent aged 9
Gwen aged 8

Penguins that are more than 5 years old are Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. So, the correct answer is 3, option C. 

Similar to the first question, the prompt did not clearly specify that the answer options should not include animals if their age is exactly as the given number, in this case, 5. This ambiguity may have led the model to include Bernard (whose age is exactly 5) as an animal older than 5 years.

Based on the above two analyses, the following improvements are recommended to avoid ambiguity:

1. Emphasize that the model's task is to select a given answer, not to perform an independent calculation and then select the closest option.
2. Specify that if an animal's age matches the one given (in this case, 5 years), it does not count as being more than that age.
3. Clarify that the task involves interpreting the tables and ensure the model particularly takes note of the age column.

A recommended improved prompt would be:

"Please analyze the data provided in the tables about penguins and giraffes, focusing on the categories of age, weight, and height. Based on the queries about animal ages, interpret the respective tables accurately to find the correct response. It is important to map the correct answers to the corresponding given options and refrain from making independent calculations. Please note that for the question about animals being 'more than' a certain age, it should not include animals of exactly that age. Finally, present the answer from the provided options and format it as follows: <answer> Option </answer>."

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

The model's response: <answer> Option (C) 7 </answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.

The response of the model is based on a wrong understanding of the age values. In its analysis, It considered Bernard and Jody, both of whom are exactly 5 years old, as more than 5 years old. The model should discern between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than'. 

Step-by-step:
1. Model incorrectly identified animals of exactly 5 years old as being 'more than 5 years old'. As a result, the penguin "Bernard" and giraffe "Jody" were included in the count when they should not have been.
2. The model calculated the total number of animals with ages of 5 or higher as 7, which is incorrect.
3. The model's comprehension is wrong, leading to the incorrect answer selection.

Prompt Improvement:

Based on this evidence, we have identified several potential areas for improvement:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that the model should take comparative words (like 'more than') into account when analyzing numerical information, especially in this case when it involves ages.

2. The prompt should emphasize that precision is crucial when comparing values against benchmarks. In this case, the distinction between being older than 5 years and being 5 years or older is key.

3. The prompt could emphasize the importance of checking the definitions of comparison words in question to confirm comprehension before proceeding to calculate and answer the question.

4. Also, it might help to use some examples with comparative terms in the initial prompt to guide the model's understanding. 

Improved prompt should include these changes and focus on accurate calculations and better comprehension of the questions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the penguin table, the animals that are more than 5 years old are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen, totaling to 4 penguins.

In the giraffe table, the animals that are more than 5 years old are Gladys, Donna, and Jody, totaling to 3 giraffes.

Therefore, the total number of animals that are more than 5 years old is 4 (penguins) + 3 (giraffes) = 7 animals.

Therefore, the answer is <answer> Option (C) 7 </answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

The model's response: <answer> Option (C) 7 </answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.

The response of the model is based on a wrong understanding of the age values. In its analysis, It considered Bernard and Jody, both of whom are exactly 5 years old, as more than 5 years old. The model should discern between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than'. 

Step-by-step:
1. Model incorrectly identified animals of exactly 5 years old as being 'more than 5 years old'. As a result, the penguin "Bernard" and giraffe "Jody" were included in the count when they should not have been.
2. The model calculated the total number of animals with ages of 5 or higher as 7, which is incorrect.
3. The model's comprehension is wrong, leading to the incorrect answer selection.

Prompt Improvement:

Based on this evidence, we have identified several potential areas for improvement:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that the model should take comparative words (like 'more than') into account when analyzing numerical information, especially in this case when it involves ages.

2. The prompt should emphasize that precision is crucial when comparing values against benchmarks. In this case, the distinction between being older than 5 years and being 5 years or older is key.

3. The prompt could emphasize the importance of checking the definitions of comparison words in question to confirm comprehension before proceeding to calculate and answer the question.

4. Also, it might help to use some examples with comparative terms in the initial prompt to guide the model's understanding. 

Improved prompt should include these changes and focus on accurate calculations and better comprehension of the questions.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the mistake the model makes is due to an incorrect representation of data. The model is asked "What is the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall?" The correct answer is "Gwen", though the model is providing the answer as "Vincent". It seems that the model has incorrectly mapped the height of the penguins to their corresponding names.

Reason for mistake:
The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to consider the latest data mentioned in the table. That is, when the new penguin James is added, it seems like the model did not include this in its calculations, leading to misrepresentation and mismatch of data.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model seems to have miscounted the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old. The correct answer is 3, but it incorrectly returns 4.

Reason for mistake:
The prompt delivers several instructions to the model. However, accuracy in counting and comparing values seems to be an issue here due to the complexity of the tasks and the presence of multiple data points. There might be confusion in interpreting the comparison operator "more than".

Improvement Recommendation:

1. Clearly instruct the model to update calculations when new data points are added into any table.
2. Ask the model to be specific in comparing values, i.e., in the case of "more than" directly instruct the model to account the penguins with age only above 5, excluding those who are exactly 5 years old.
3. Simplify instructions related to the comparison and counting tasks in the prompt so that the model can grasp these operations more efficiently.
4. Request the model to cross-check the results based on each individual data parameter (age, weight, and height) in order to minimize mistakes.
5. Assure that the model understands the full prompt and re-emphasize the importance of accuracy in predicting results.
6. Remind the model to adhere to the "answer" format strictly and not to provide extra information in the answer.

The task at hand involves the examination of tables detailing specific information about two distinct animal species: penguins and giraffes. The data focuses on three parameters for each animal: age, height, and weight. Be rigorous in your approach and analyze each dataset separately, making distinct comparisons within each individual animal category. Please beware that new data may be added to tables and ensure that these additions are factored into your analyses.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the penguin table, the animals that are more than 5 years old are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. So, there are 4 penguins that are more than 5 years old.

In the giraffe table, the animals that are more than 5 years old are Gladys, Donna, and Jody. So, there are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old.

Combining both tables, there are a total of 7 animals that are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer> (C) 7 </answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Model's Response: <answer> (C) 7 </answer>
Correct Answer: (A) 5
Wrong Reason:
- Misinterpretation by the Model: The model misinterpreted the question by incorrectly including Bernard from the penguin table who is only 5 years old but not 'more than 5'. This led to a miscalculation.
- Mathematical Error: The model calculated the total number of animals more than 5 years old as 7, when the correct total is 5. This was a mathematical error.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:
- Clarify Age Comparison: Reinforce the precise interpretation of 'more than' when the question involves a comparative statement about age. Ensure the model understands that 'more than 5 years old' excludes animals who are exactly 5 years old.
- Emphasize Detailed Analysis: Highlight the need for careful analysis of each data set to confirm the details before coming to a conclusion. 
- Improved Verification: Insist on strict verification of findings, both in counting and in mathematical calculations, to avoid errors.
- Improve Descriptions: It would benefit to clarify the explanation of the tasks, like analyzing data, matching results in options, and wrapping the answer in specific brackets.
- Explicit Instructions: Be more explicit about checking every value precisely and adhering to the exact question conditions.
- Age Discrimination: Consider adding a phrase prompting the model to segregate the animals whose age is precisely the same as the benchmark value.

The task at hand involves the examination of tables detailing specific information about two distinct animal species: penguins and giraffes. The data focuses on three parameters for each animal: age, height, and weight. Be rigorous in your approach and analyze each dataset separately, making distinct comparisons within each individual animal category. Please beware that new data may be added to tables and ensure that these additions are factored into your analyses. 

When it comes to any questions related to age, refer to the appropriate data table and handle this information with precision. Be extra attentive to questions involving comparisons of age against a particular value and understand that the question may require you to look for ages older than the mentioned value, not equal to. Any other subsequent queries originating from these data tables should be resolved efficiently, mapping the correct answer to the corresponding options listed, avoiding any potential confusion between the two animal categories. 

Counting and comparing these numbers accurately is your key task, and it is important to validate your observations and calculations meticulously to avoid errors. 

After validation, generate your answer by selecting and confirming the correct option based on your comprehensive evaluation of the data. However, bear in mind that the option you choose must adhere to the prescribed format: it should be embedded between <answer> and </answer> brackets. 

For instance, if your identified correct option is B, your answer should be formatted as <answer> Option B </answer>. 

Remember not to add any extra information within the answer brackets. The brackets should only contain the correct option as per the analysis of the tables. Now, proceed and inspect the tables and answer the questions following the guidelines given above.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

For Wrong Example <1>:

1) Question: What is the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall? 

   The model's response is: <answer> Gwen </answer>
   
   The correct label is: D 
   
   The model's prediction is: E.

Reason for the mistake: It appears that the model has selected the incorrect option E instead of the correct one D before outputting the answer. This probably could have happened due to a misinterpretation of the data entries or a misunderstanding of the order of the variable options related to the penguin names. This model error can be difficult to diagnose without access to its perception of the data. One possibility could be that it failed to consider the freshest data, as the prompt insists on the inclusion of new data. However, in this case, the new entry has no impact on the correct answer, leading to possible confusion.

For Wrong Example <2>:

1) Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old? 

   The model's response is: <answer> Option D </answer>

   Correct label is: A
   
   The model's prediction is: D.

Reason for the mistake: The model may have misunderstood the question's essence and counted all the animals regardless of their age, leading to the incorrect prediction. After the model received the tables data, it may have considered the total animals exceeding 5 years, including penguins and giraffes. This error could stem from the model's difficulty in discerning the condition 'more than 5 years' accurately and may have included animals that are exactly 5 years or less.

Prompts Improvements:

1) Enforcement of strict numerical interpretation: It might be useful to mention explicitly in the prompt that the model should take into account the exact numerical values (such as 'greater than' or 'equal to').

2) Improving data handling direction: The instruction to include fresh data seemingly confuses the model when no fresh data has an impact on the outcome. Hence, the emphasis on new data should be rephrased to direct the model to accommodate new data only when it affects the answer.

3) Instructions for dealing with different categories: The prompt could include more explicit guidance on dealing with different categories (penguins and giraffes) separately while answering questions based on individual or collective data.

4) Clearer mapping rules: The prompt could more clearly state that the order of the provided options always matches the order of names in the data table. This could prevent misunderstandings that might lead to incorrect option selections. 

5) Accommodation for different question types: The prompt might benefit from acknowledging different types of questions that count or compare animals or their properties. A more distinct direction in handling these types will help the model.

Wrong Example 1 Analysis:

The question in this example is asking for how many penguins are "more than 5 years old." The data provides ages for 4 penguins, and three of them are above the age of 5 (Louis, age 7; Vincent, age 9; Gwen, age 8). This means the correct answer is 3. 

The model correctly identified the answer as 3, but makes a mistake when it comes to formatting the response. Instead of placing the correct option which is (C) between the answer brackets, it place the text "Option 3" between the brackets (i.e. <answer> Option 3 </answer>). This happens because the prompt does not clearly specify that the answer placed between the brackets should be the corresponding option label (A, B, C, D, or E) from the question, not the numeric value of the answer. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

1. Lack of Clarity: The instructions in the prompt may need to be more specific about formatting the final answer option. While the prompt does state to embed the answer between <answer> and </answer> brackets, it doesn't explicitly say to use the option letter, not the numeric value.

2. Example Confusion: The prompt provides an example where the correct option is 'B', but does not differentiate between numeric and alphabetic answers. The model may have taken 'Option B' to represent a numeric answer based on the example.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. The prompt would benefit from language that explicitly instructs the model to use the option letter (A, B, C, D, or E) from the question options as the final answer.

2. Including an example that includes a correct numeric answer would help make clear the differentiation between the numeric value of the answer and the alphabetic label. 

3. The prompt should mention that the expected answer should map to the enumerated options given in the question and not be a direct integer or value calculation. 

4. To avoid confusion, the example given in the instruction shouldn’t be in the 'Option B' format. Instead, use a clearer example like <answer> B </answer> to hammer in the idea of the expected response format.

5. Provide an explicit instruction that the answer should reference the option label, not the numeric result, such as: "Your answer must reference the corresponding option label (A, B, C, D, or E), not the numeric result of your analysis".

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
The task at hand involves the examination of tables detailing specific information about two distinct animal species: penguins and giraffes. The data focuses on three parameters for each animal: age, height, and weight. Be rigorous in your approach and analyze each dataset separately, making distinct comparisons within each individual animal category. Please beware that new data may be added to tables and ensure that these additions are factored into your analyses. 

When it comes to any questions related to age, refer to the appropriate data table and handle this information with precision. Be extra attentive to questions involving comparisons of age against a particular value and understand that the question may require you to look for ages older than the mentioned value, not equal to. Any other subsequent queries originating from these data tables should be resolved efficiently, mapping the correct answer to the corresponding options listed, avoiding any potential confusion between the two animal categories. 

Counting and comparing these numbers accurately is your key task, and it is important to validate your observations and calculations meticulously to avoid errors. 

After validation, generate your answer by selecting and confirming the correct option based on your comprehensive evaluation of the data. However, bear in mind that the option you choose must adhere to the prescribed format: it should be embedded between <answer> and </answer> brackets. 

For instance, if your identified correct option is B, your answer should be formatted as <answer> Option B </answer>. 

Remember not to add any extra information within the answer brackets. The brackets should only contain the correct option as per the analysis of the tables. Now, proceed and inspect the tables and answer the questions following the guidelines given above.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Remember not to add any extra information within the answer brackets. The brackets should only contain the correct option as per the analysis of the tables. Now, proceed and inspect the tables and answer the questions following the guidelines given above.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer> Option 3 </answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: N/A: Format error.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1 Analysis:

The question in this example is asking for how many penguins are "more than 5 years old." The data provides ages for 4 penguins, and three of them are above the age of 5 (Louis, age 7; Vincent, age 9; Gwen, age 8). This means the correct answer is 3. 

The model correctly identified the answer as 3, but makes a mistake when it comes to formatting the response. Instead of placing the correct option which is (C) between the answer brackets, it place the text "Option 3" between the brackets (i.e. <answer> Option 3 </answer>). This happens because the prompt does not clearly specify that the answer placed between the brackets should be the corresponding option label (A, B, C, D, or E) from the question, not the numeric value of the answer. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

1. Lack of Clarity: The instructions in the prompt may need to be more specific about formatting the final answer option. While the prompt does state to embed the answer between <answer> and </answer> brackets, it doesn't explicitly say to use the option letter, not the numeric value.

2. Example Confusion: The prompt provides an example where the correct option is 'B', but does not differentiate between numeric and alphabetic answers. The model may have taken 'Option B' to represent a numeric answer based on the example.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. The prompt would benefit from language that explicitly instructs the model to use the option letter (A, B, C, D, or E) from the question options as the final answer.

2. Including an example that includes a correct numeric answer would help make clear the differentiation between the numeric value of the answer and the alphabetic label. 

3. The prompt should mention that the expected answer should map to the enumerated options given in the question and not be a direct integer or value calculation. 

4. To avoid confusion, the example given in the instruction shouldn’t be in the 'Option B' format. Instead, use a clearer example like <answer> B </answer> to hammer in the idea of the expected response format.

5. Provide an explicit instruction that the answer should reference the option label, not the numeric result, such as: "Your answer must reference the corresponding option label (A, B, C, D, or E), not the numeric result of your analysis".

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Interpret data from tables about animals, specifically their age, height and weight. Count and compare these numbers correctly. If there is any age-related data question, be sure to handle it accurately. Finally, answer the questions with the correct option and output the answer in the format with the selected option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Utilize data from tables detailing information about penguins and giraffes, specifically documenting their age, height, and weight. Analyze each set of data independently of the other, ensuring a thorough comparison of the numbers within each single animal category. If there are any queries relating to the age of the animals, ensure those are addressed accurately using the respective table. For questions arising from the data, map the correct answer to the corresponding options accurately and carefully, ensuring no mix-ups between different animal categories. Generate your answer by choosing and confirming the correct option based on your analysis of the tables. Please present your answer in the following format: <answer> Option </answer>.
(3) Please examine tables depicting detailed information about penguins and giraffes, each focusing on their age, height, and weight. Analyze each set of data individually, distinctly comparing the numbers within each solitary animal category. Also, if there are any age-related inquiries, use the appropriate table to address them precisely. For any further questions that arise from these data tables, identify the correct answer and map it to the corresponding options with utmost accuracy, taking care to prevent any confusion between the two different animal categories. 

Remember, your task is to count and compare these numbers correctly, and pay particular attention when the question involves comparing the age of the animals against a benchmark value. Double-check your analysis and calculations to ensure they are error-free. 

Once you verify your findings, generate your answer by selecting and reaffirming the right option based on your thorough assessment of the tables. Then, deliver your answer in the prescribed format: the chosen option should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> brackets. 

For example, if the correct answer option is B, your response should be <answer> Option B </answer>. Go ahead and examine the tables, then answer accordingly.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Incorrect format error
The model has given the correct answer but failed to display it properly in the format as mentioned in the prompt. In the prompt it was communicated that the answer should be embedded between <answer> and </answer> brackets and should be in the form like <answer> Option B </answer> but the model failed to include the appropriate 'Option' part. It may be due to the models' incapability in understanding the requirement about how to format the response or inability to realize that the response cannot be detached from the 'Option' part even though the user's requirement is quite clear in the prompt.

<2> Misinterpreted the answer
The data clearly shows that Gwen is the penguin who's 70 cm tall. The model has extracted the correct information from the table but it didn't correctly match this information to the provided options. Instead, it perceives 'Gwen' as the answer, rather than identifying the corresponding Option D, despite the prompt explicitly stating how the answer should be formatted.

<3> Misinterpretation of data from multiple tables
The model failed to correctly answer the question due to confusion with data from two tables. There are four animals older than 5 years old: three penguins (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen) and two giraffes (Gladys and Donna). The model may have misunderstood the question and counted all the animals, leading to option D being selected.

Improvements:
1. Emphasize the importance of the formatting the answer according to the guidelines provided.
2. The instructions might need to be more explicit about matching correct answers to the lettered options, rather than directly writing out the answer.
3. The prompt could specify more clearly about when to take into account data from both tables versus focusing on a single table.
4. The model might need instructions that specify the difference between giving a count and providing the name of something.
5. The instructions should specify data analysis with the correct order like age first, then height, and finally weight. It should also be clearer in the prompt that the data used to answer the question should strictly relate to the query being asked and that attention should be paid to the condition of the question.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer> Option D </answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Incorrect format error
The model has given the correct answer but failed to display it properly in the format as mentioned in the prompt. In the prompt it was communicated that the answer should be embedded between <answer> and </answer> brackets and should be in the form like <answer> Option B </answer> but the model failed to include the appropriate 'Option' part. It may be due to the models' incapability in understanding the requirement about how to format the response or inability to realize that the response cannot be detached from the 'Option' part even though the user's requirement is quite clear in the prompt.

<2> Misinterpreted the answer
The data clearly shows that Gwen is the penguin who's 70 cm tall. The model has extracted the correct information from the table but it didn't correctly match this information to the provided options. Instead, it perceives 'Gwen' as the answer, rather than identifying the corresponding Option D, despite the prompt explicitly stating how the answer should be formatted.

<3> Misinterpretation of data from multiple tables
The model failed to correctly answer the question due to confusion with data from two tables. There are four animals older than 5 years old: three penguins (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen) and two giraffes (Gladys and Donna). The model may have misunderstood the question and counted all the animals, leading to option D being selected.

Improvements:
1. Emphasize the importance of the formatting the answer according to the guidelines provided.
2. The instructions might need to be more explicit about matching correct answers to the lettered options, rather than directly writing out the answer.
3. The prompt could specify more clearly about when to take into account data from both tables versus focusing on a single table.
4. The model might need instructions that specify the difference between giving a count and providing the name of something.
5. The instructions should specify data analysis with the correct order like age first, then height, and finally weight. It should also be clearer in the prompt that the data used to answer the question should strictly relate to the query being asked and that attention should be paid to the condition of the question.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Interpret data from tables about animals, specifically their age, height and weight. Count and compare these numbers correctly. If there is any age-related data question, be sure to handle it accurately. Finally, answer the questions with the correct option and output the answer in the format with the selected option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Utilize data from tables detailing information about penguins and giraffes, specifically documenting their age, height, and weight. Analyze each set of data independently of the other, ensuring a thorough comparison of the numbers within each single animal category. If there are any queries relating to the age of the animals, ensure those are addressed accurately using the respective table. For questions arising from the data, map the correct answer to the corresponding options accurately and carefully, ensuring no mix-ups between different animal categories. Generate your answer by choosing and confirming the correct option based on your analysis of the tables. Please present your answer in the following format: <answer> Option </answer>.
(3) Please examine tables depicting detailed information about penguins and giraffes, each focusing on their age, height, and weight. Analyze each set of data individually, distinctly comparing the numbers within each solitary animal category. Also, if there are any age-related inquiries, use the appropriate table to address them precisely. For any further questions that arise from these data tables, identify the correct answer and map it to the corresponding options with utmost accuracy, taking care to prevent any confusion between the two different animal categories. 

Remember, your task is to count and compare these numbers correctly, and pay particular attention when the question involves comparing the age of the animals against a benchmark value. Double-check your analysis and calculations to ensure they are error-free. 

Once you verify your findings, generate your answer by selecting and reaffirming the right option based on your thorough assessment of the tables. Then, deliver your answer in the prescribed format: the chosen option should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> brackets. 

For example, if the correct answer option is B, your response should be <answer> Option B </answer>. Go ahead and examine the tables, then answer accordingly.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Model's response: <answer>(B) 6</answer>
Correct response: <answer>(A) 5</answer>

The question asked for the number of animals over the age of 5. The model included the penguins and giraffes who are exactly 5 years old in its count, leading to an incorrect total of 6 animals. The prompt, however, had explicitly stated that the condition "more than 5 years old" should only count animals aged over 5, excluding those exactly 5 years old.

The error may have occurred be due to confusion with the instruction. The model may not have properly processed the mathematical instruction for "[excluding] those exactly 5 years old." This requires the model to understand and interpret this instruction correctly to get an accurate number of animals.

Example 2:

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Model's response: <answer>(E)</answer>
Correct response: <answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

The problem here might arise from the fact that the model does not understand the concept of alphabetical order sorting of the data. The model incorrectly chose a name that was not present in the data provided, which suggests a misunderstanding of the task or an unsuccessful attempt to extract and process the correct names from the data. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
1) Make mathematical conditions clearer: As seen in Example 1's error, there could be misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the mathematical conditions given within the prompt. Ensure these conditions are prescribed explicitly.

2) Stress the importance of using only provided data: The error from Example 2 demonstrates that the model may benefit from more explicit instruction to use and process only the data provided within the tables.

3) Provide more explicit task instructions: Both examples reflected misunderstanding of the task instructions, suggesting that more explicit and specific task instruction could improve the model's performance.

4) Explicitly state the sorting method: In the second example, the model may not understand how to sort the names in alphabetical order. Adding explicit instruction about sorting can help.

5) Strengthen understanding of the format instruction: Ensure the model understands the necessity to bracket the answers between <answer> and </answer>.

6) Clarify numerical operators: Be more explicit about what numerical operators mean. For example, clarify that 'more than 5' does not include 5.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Model's response: <answer>(B) 6</answer>
Correct response: <answer>(A) 5</answer>

The question asked for the number of animals over the age of 5. The model included the penguins and giraffes who are exactly 5 years old in its count, leading to an incorrect total of 6 animals. The prompt, however, had explicitly stated that the condition "more than 5 years old" should only count animals aged over 5, excluding those exactly 5 years old.

The error may have occurred be due to confusion with the instruction. The model may not have properly processed the mathematical instruction for "[excluding] those exactly 5 years old." This requires the model to understand and interpret this instruction correctly to get an accurate number of animals.

Example 2:

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Model's response: <answer>(E)</answer>
Correct response: <answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

The problem here might arise from the fact that the model does not understand the concept of alphabetical order sorting of the data. The model incorrectly chose a name that was not present in the data provided, which suggests a misunderstanding of the task or an unsuccessful attempt to extract and process the correct names from the data. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
1) Make mathematical conditions clearer: As seen in Example 1's error, there could be misunderstanding or misinterpretation of the mathematical conditions given within the prompt. Ensure these conditions are prescribed explicitly.

2) Stress the importance of using only provided data: The error from Example 2 demonstrates that the model may benefit from more explicit instruction to use and process only the data provided within the tables.

3) Provide more explicit task instructions: Both examples reflected misunderstanding of the task instructions, suggesting that more explicit and specific task instruction could improve the model's performance.

4) Explicitly state the sorting method: In the second example, the model may not understand how to sort the names in alphabetical order. Adding explicit instruction about sorting can help.

5) Strengthen understanding of the format instruction: Ensure the model understands the necessity to bracket the answers between <answer> and </answer>.

6) Clarify numerical operators: Be more explicit about what numerical operators mean. For example, clarify that 'more than 5' does not include 5.

The model's response appears to be correct for this question as it correctly identified that Vincent's age (9) is more than Gwen's age (8) and it selected the appropriate option according to the prompt. It seems like there is a typing mistake in the model's prediction. Hence, the error is not due to the prompt.

<2>

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Model's response: The name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is: (E) James.
Correct label: C
Model's prediction: E

The model failed to understand the question at the core. The question asks for the penguin with a name last in alphabetical order among the given list. However, the model seems to have been confused by the options. Consequently, it picked 'James,' which comes alphabetically last among the given options but is not an actual name from the list presented in the data. This error is a result of misunderstanding about the question.

Improvement Aspects:
1. The prompt should emphasize understanding and processing the question's requirements accurately. Even though it says to "choose the correct option from the given options," the model needs to understand this in the context of the data presented. 
2. The model should be instructed to cross-check the options with the data set before finalizing the answer.
3. The model should be prompted clearly to refer to the data provided in order to avoid incorrect assumptions or generalizations.
4. The prompt can be updated to specify that options should always be verified against the tables/data provided.
5. The model sometimes does not strictly follow the instruction about putting the chosen option in the correct format, so more emphasis could be placed on correctly formatting the response.

Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

Wrong Answer Given by AI: (B) 6 
Correct Answer: (A) 5

Explanation of Incorrect Response:
1. In the instruction, it clearly states "more than 5" means strictly over 5, not including 5. It seems that the AI model misunderstood this caveat— it counted the animals aged exactly 5, not adhering to the conditions set out in the prompt.
2. The AI model may have counted the animals aged 5 as part of the "more than 5" category, which it shouldn't have. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:
1. Misinterpretation of Operator: The model seems to have confused "more than 5" with "5 and above". This could be due to the phrasing or the model's internal understanding of the instruction.
2. Applying Numeric Operators: The model may have struggled with applying the numeric operators correctly to the animal age data.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Cleary specify what 'more than' means: Instead of simply saying numerical operators should be understood in their mathematical sense, specify that ‘more than’ does not include the number itself. 
2. Break Down Conditions: Provide clearer direction that should be followed strictly. For instance, explain that numeric conditions like 'more than' exclude the number following it, while 'and above' includes it.
3. Concrete Examples: Provide clear examples of how to correctly interpret age-related conditions in the prompt.
4. Re-emphasize Critical Points: Points that could be sources of misinterpretation can be repeated elsewhere in the prompt, ensuring the AI understands the rules.
5. Use Simpler, Direct Language: The instructions might be overly technical or confusing for the model. Simplifying the language or making guidance more direct might prevent misunderstanding.

<1> Examination of Errors:

Question asked: 
"How many animals are more than 5 years old?"

Model's response: 
<answer>(C) 7</answer> 

Correct label/response: (A) 5

This indicates that the model misunderstood the question. The query is pertaining to the total number of animals that are more than five years old, not the age of an animal themselves which is oddly what the model's response seems to indicate. The prompt does clarify what the term "more than 5 years old" means, but it doesn't explicitly mention that the model should total the number of all animals meeting these conditions. 

By only considering animals older than 5 years, we get 4 penguins (Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen) and 1 giraffe (Gladys), which totals to 5. This is reflected in answer choice (A), so that is the correct answer, as opposed to choice (C), which the model chose, indicating the age of 7 years. 

Possible improvements for the prompt:

1. Add clarification that questions may ask for totals or counts of the animals and this needs to be deduced from the data.
   
2. Better explanation needed for the interpretation of multiple animals in the data table. Currently, the model seems to understand the conditions applied—here being animals aged six years and above—but it fails to apply this to multiple animals simultaneously.

3. Reiterate the specific numerical values attached to the provided options, emphasizing that these options correspond to possible solutions to the task at hand, rather than an animal's age or other feature it might misinterpret.

4. Suggest the model to take note of the possible range of answers, in this case, the possible number of animals, and to ensure its answer falls within this range.

5. Not explicitly mentioned, but worth noting: Make sure the model discerns between different tables. Despite being stated in the prompt, the model may be better guided by specifically indicating how to handle multiple tables and reminding it not to mix data from them.

<answer>(C) 7</answer> 

Correct label/response: (A) 5

This indicates that the model misunderstood the question. The query is pertaining to the total number of animals that are more than five years old, not the age of an animal themselves which is oddly what the model's response seems to indicate. The prompt does clarify what the term "more than 5 years old" means, but it doesn't explicitly mention that the model should total the number of all animals meeting these conditions. 

By only considering animals older than 5 years, we get 4 penguins (Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen) and 1 giraffe (Gladys), which totals to 5. This is reflected in answer choice (A), so that is the correct answer, as opposed to choice (C), which the model chose, indicating the age of 7 years. 

Possible improvements for the prompt:

1. Add clarification that questions may ask for totals or counts of the animals and this needs to be deduced from the data.
   
2. Better explanation needed for the interpretation of multiple animals in the data table. Currently, the model seems to understand the conditions applied—here being animals aged six years and above—but it fails to apply this to multiple animals simultaneously.

3. Reiterate the specific numerical values attached to the provided options, emphasizing that these options correspond to possible solutions to the task at hand, rather than an animal's age or other feature it might misinterpret.

4. Suggest the model to take note of the possible range of answers, in this case, the possible number of animals, and to ensure its answer falls within this range.

5. Not explicitly mentioned, but worth noting: Make sure the model discerns between different tables. Despite being stated in the prompt, the model may be better guided by specifically indicating how to handle multiple tables and reminding it not to mix data from them.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Interpret data from tables about animals, specifically their age, height and weight. Count and compare these numbers correctly. If there is any age-related data question, be sure to handle it accurately. Finally, answer the questions with the correct option and output the answer in the format with the selected option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Utilize data from tables detailing information about penguins and giraffes, specifically documenting their age, height, and weight. Analyze each set of data independently of the other, ensuring a thorough comparison of the numbers within each single animal category. If there are any queries relating to the age of the animals, ensure those are addressed accurately using the respective table. For questions arising from the data, map the correct answer to the corresponding options accurately and carefully, ensuring no mix-ups between different animal categories. Generate your answer by choosing and confirming the correct option based on your analysis of the tables. Please present your answer in the following format: <answer> Option </answer>.
(3) Use the data from tables about penguins and giraffes, which provide details on their age, height, and weight. Examine each animal category individually, comparing the values within each category alone. Efficiently handle any questions about the age of animals, by referring to the appropriate table and accurately interpreting age-related conditions. For instance, "more than 5 years old" should only count animals aged over 5, excluding those exactly 5 years old. When you answer questions stemming from the data, make sure to choose the correct option from the given options, taking extra care not to confuse data between different animal categories. Create your answer based on the accurate interpretation of the numerical data from the tables, and put the correct option in the following format: <answer> Option </answer>. Please note that numerical operators should be understood in their mathematical sense. "More than 5" means strictly over 5, not including 5, whereas "5 and above" includes 5.
(4) Your task involves interpreting data from tables that provide details about penguins and giraffes, including their age, height, and weight. Consider each type of animal separately, comparing only the data within that category. When addressing questions about the age of animals, use the provided tables to accurately understand age-specific conditions. To clarify, when asked about animals "more than 5 years old", include only those animals aged 6 years and older, not those exactly 5 years old. When generating responses, carefully select the accurate option from those provided, ensuring not to mix up any data between the different animal categories. When responding, utilize the data specifically presented in the tables and do not insert data or options not explicitly mentioned. For instance, if you are asked to report the last name in alphabetical order, use sorting method that starts from 'A' to 'Z' using the names provided in the table only. Your answer should reflect a clear understanding and interpretation of the numerical data from the tables. Frame your response with the selected option enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. Please remember that numerical operators follow mathematical conventions. For example, "more than 5" is exclusive of 5, meaning it includes only numbers strictly greater than 5, while "5 and above" includes 5.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1 Analysis:

Question: What is the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall?
Model's Response: (B) Bernard

In this case, the problem with the wrong prediction seems to arise from the model's inability to accurately decipher the height column in the data table provided. The model's incorrect response suggests that it may have misread or ignored the numerical values associated with each animal's height.

To remedy this, the instructions can be modified to emphasize the importance of cross-referencing the appropriate numerical value with the associated animal name. 

Wrong Example 2 Analysis:

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Model's Response: (D) Gwen

This incorrect response indicates that the model may not have sorted the penguins' names in correct alphabetical order. It's possible that the model is mistakenly utilizing a different systemic order (i.e., chronological, numeric, etc.), which would explain why it produced an incorrect answer.

In the prompt's revision, a more explicit focus on the correct usage of alphabetical order might prove beneficial. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Elaborate on the efficient cross-referencing of the data: The model should be more explicitly instructed to cross-reference the appropriate numerical value with its associated animal name.

2. Emphasize on alphabetical order: Instructions could include clear definitions and examples of what specific "alphabetical order" means, stressing the need for the model to start the sorting from 'A' through 'Z'.

3. Incorporate data confirmation: The model can be encouraged to confirm its chosen data point before providing the final answer or making any comparison to avoid misreadings.

4. Special attention to numerical values: Instructions should re-emphasize that numerical values corresponding to height, weight should be read carefully. A tip or example could be included in the instruction, illustrating how to correlate these values to the corresponding animal.

5. Specify relationship between data categories: The prompt could be clearer about how the name, age, height, and weight of the animals relate to one another. 

6. Clarify interpretation rule: Make sure to stress the rules about interpretations like "more than 5" and "5 and above". Provide a clear example for such interpretation rules in the prompt.

By addressing these aspects, the revised prompt will likely lead to a more precise answer from the language model.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:
The question asked for the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order (in relation to the names given in the table only). The model's input was correct, and it was explained that the list should be sorted from 'A' to 'Z'. The model, however, selected 'Gwen' rather than 'Vincent.' It seems that there may be a misunderstanding of alphabetical order or a misinterpretation of what qualifies as 'the last name sorted by alphabetic order.'

For Example 2:
The question asked for the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall. Based on the table data, the correct response is 'Gwen.' However, the model wrongly selected James. The model failed to correlate the correct height with the corresponding name despite the data clearly indicating that 'Gwen' has a height of 70 cm. This could suggest an issue with either how the model understands the specifications of the question or how it interprets the table data.

For Example 3:
The model was supposed to count and determine how many animals are more than 5 years old. The instruction stipulates not to count those exactly 5 years old. However, the model misinterpreted the exclusion rule and included the animal that was exactly 5 years old ('Jody'), resulting in one extra count.

Prompt Improvement:
1. Clarify Terms: Although 'last' in alphabetical order usually refers to 'last letter' or 'Z', models might confuse this with the 'last' in the list. Using 'last' as 'Z' needs to clearly specified in the prompt.
2. Address Misinterpretation issue: It needs a clear description stating that the model should accurately read the data from the table to answer the question correctly. Reinforce the model's understanding of correlating the specified attribute (height, weight, age) with the corresponding characteristic (name).
3. Indicate Prerequisites: Specify that when determining values above a certain threshold, the exact number indicated should not be included in the count (i.e., clear mathematical convention descriptions).
4. Clear Instruction for Mathematical Symbols: Emphasize the meaning of 'more than' as being exclusive of the number mentioned; Offer "greater/equal to" or "less/equal to" and solidly instruct the model to understand these.

The revised instruction might be something like this:

"Your task involves interpreting numerical and categorical data from tables that detail animal information such as name, age, height, and weight. Separate the animals into different categories and analyze their data accordingly. Extract accurate information about age, height, and weight from the tables, and remember that when calculating the number of animals over a certain age, the term 'more than 5 years old' does not include animals who are exactly 5 years old. Only those aged 6 years and older should be included. 

When sorting names alphabetically, understand that 'last' refers to the name that would appear at the end of an 'A' to 'Z' sorted list. You are to provide an answer picked from the options given, ones that strictly rely on the table data. Do not introduce new information not present in the data or help yourself with options not explicitly given. Enclose your final response between <answer> and </answer>. Please note, the term 'more than' does not include the number itself, representing a mathematical convention where 'more than 5' only includes numbers greater than 5, not 5 itself."

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Interpret data from tables about animals, specifically their age, height and weight. Count and compare these numbers correctly. If there is any age-related data question, be sure to handle it accurately. Finally, answer the questions with the correct option and output the answer in the format with the selected option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Utilize data from tables detailing information about penguins and giraffes, specifically documenting their age, height, and weight. Analyze each set of data independently of the other, ensuring a thorough comparison of the numbers within each single animal category. If there are any queries relating to the age of the animals, ensure those are addressed accurately using the respective table. For questions arising from the data, map the correct answer to the corresponding options accurately and carefully, ensuring no mix-ups between different animal categories. Generate your answer by choosing and confirming the correct option based on your analysis of the tables. Please present your answer in the following format: <answer> Option </answer>.
(3) Use the data from tables about penguins and giraffes, which provide details on their age, height, and weight. Examine each animal category individually, comparing the values within each category alone. Efficiently handle any questions about the age of animals, by referring to the appropriate table and accurately interpreting age-related conditions. For instance, "more than 5 years old" should only count animals aged over 5, excluding those exactly 5 years old. When you answer questions stemming from the data, make sure to choose the correct option from the given options, taking extra care not to confuse data between different animal categories. Create your answer based on the accurate interpretation of the numerical data from the tables, and put the correct option in the following format: <answer> Option </answer>. Please note that numerical operators should be understood in their mathematical sense. "More than 5" means strictly over 5, not including 5, whereas "5 and above" includes 5.
(4) Your task involves interpreting data from tables that provide details about penguins and giraffes, including their age, height, and weight. Consider each type of animal separately, comparing only the data within that category. When addressing questions about the age of animals, use the provided tables to accurately understand age-specific conditions. To clarify, when asked about animals "more than 5 years old", include only those animals aged 6 years and older, not those exactly 5 years old. When generating responses, carefully select the accurate option from those provided, ensuring not to mix up any data between the different animal categories. When responding, utilize the data specifically presented in the tables and do not insert data or options not explicitly mentioned. For instance, if you are asked to report the last name in alphabetical order, use sorting method that starts from 'A' to 'Z' using the names provided in the table only. Your answer should reflect a clear understanding and interpretation of the numerical data from the tables. Frame your response with the selected option enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. Please remember that numerical operators follow mathematical conventions. For example, "more than 5" is exclusive of 5, meaning it includes only numbers strictly greater than 5, while "5 and above" includes 5.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.

response:
<START> Your assignment is to interpret table data about two animal groups: penguins and giraffes. The tables contain information about their ages, heights, and weights. Examine each animal category individually and make comparisons only within the same animal group. Use the tables to accurately handle any age-related inquiries; for instance, in questions seeking to identify animals "older than 5 years", include only those whose ages are strictly 6 years or more, excluding those precisely 5 years old. 

When asked to name the 'last' in alphabetical order, interpret 'last' according to an 'A' to 'Z' sorting, where for instance, 'Zoe' is 'after' 'Aaron'. Therefore, 'last' means the name which could appear at the end of a sorted list (like 'Zoe' in this example), not the last one in the unsorted list. 

When providing responses, be meticulous in selecting the accurate option from the provided list. Be careful not to confuse data between different animal categories. Your response should incorporate data from the tables and nothing external to them; do not add or use data not explicitly mentioned in the tables. 

Render your final choice as selected option, enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> markers. Always remember, mathematical operators follow specific conventions: "more than 5" is exclusive of the number 5 itself and only includes numbers greater than 5. Conversely, "5 and above" means 5 plus numbers greater than 5. Respond considering these mathematical subtleties, ensuring your interpretations are concise and accurate. This task tests not only your data interpretation skills, but also attention to detail.<END>

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
Which is the oldest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The oldest penguin is Vincent, who is 9 years old. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example:

In the given example, the language model makes an error because it does not consider the newly added penguin's age, James, who is 12 years old, and directly selects Vincent who is 9 years old as the oldest penguin. This could be due to a variety of factors:

1. The wording of the prompt may have led the model to neglect recent updates or changes within the data. The model was likely not correctly interpreting the part "...We now add a penguin to the table: James, 12, 90, 12...". Even though the prompt explicitly mentions that a new entry is added to the table, the model still uses the data before the addition.

2. Another possible reason could be that the prompt does not explicitly state it should consider any updates or changes made to the initial data. Therefore, the model perhaps simply analyzed the first set of data it was given.

3. The model seems to struggle to accommodate changes in the data. Even if the data changes, the model should be reactive and adjust its analysis accordingly.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that any data updates should be factored in during the analysis.

2. Clarify the importance of continuously updating the data set and interpreting new data points as they come in.

3. Use clear directions in the prompt to ensure the model realizes it must reassess the data each time a new entry is added.

4. Explicitly instruct the model to look for any changes or updates to the data during the analysis process.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Using data from tables that contain information about penguins and giraffes, analyze their age, height, and weight. Each animal category should be evaluated individually, ensuring values within each category alone are compared. When dealing with any questions about the age of these animals, refer to the appropriate table and interpret age-related conditions accurately. To be clear, If the age is referenced as "more than 5 years old", count only animals aged over 5, and do not include those exactly 5 years old. For any questions about the data, select the correct answer from the given options with precision, making sure not to muddle data between different animal categories. Your answer should be based on the accurate interpretation of the numerical data from the tables. Present the correct option in the format: <answer> Option </answer>. Note that numerical statements follow strict mathematical rules. "More than 5" means only numbers greater than 5, it does not include 5. In contrast, the phrase "5 and above" will indeed include 5. Reinforcing this concept, remember to apply this rule strictly - animals that are exactly 5 years old are not counted as "more than 5 years old", they should be excluded from this category.

Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the example given, the model was asked to identify how many animals from the given tables are more than 5 years old. The correct answer, according to the data, should be (A) 5, with penguins: Louis, Vincent, Gwen, and giraffes: Gladys, Donna being over the age of 5. Despite this, the model predicted answer (C) 7.

There are a couple of potential issues due to the prompt:

1. Ambiguity in Instruction: The prompt might have been too verbose or complicated for the model, which leads to misunderstanding. Despite a clear explanation about the meaning of "more than 5 years old", the model still included animals that are exactly 5 years old in its answer (Bernard the penguin and Jody the giraffe).

2. Complexity of Task: The prompt requires the model to filter and analyze data based on certain conditions, which might be beyond its current capability. The model could be improved in term of specific condition filtering.

3. Lack of emphasis: The model seems to have missed the distinction between "more than 5" versus "5 and above", even though the prompt explains this clearly. It suggests that core instructions or rules could be better emphasised to help the model understand and apply them.

Based on these reasons, the following improvements can be made to create a more effective and efficient prompt:

1. Simplify Instruction: Reduce the complexity and length of the instructions, focusing only on the most crucial information needed to complete the task.

2. Highlight Key Information: Emphasize the core instructions and rules (e.g., the differentiation between "more than 5" and "5 and above") to help the model grasp and apply those important concepts.

3. Clear Task Definition: Specify explicitly that the model needs to filter and analyze data from tables, prompting the model to pay full attention to this function. 

4. Split instruction: Break the task into smaller, obviously distinct steps for easier understanding. 

5. Practice examples: Including examples of the task can also be beneficial in leading the model to answer correctly in the real scenario.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The reason behind the language model providing an incorrect answer hinges on it misinterpretation of age-related conditions expressed in the prompt. The prompt specifically stated to consider an animal aged "more than 5 years old" to only be those aged over 5, excluding the animals aged exactly 5. This is further emphasized with the clarity provided about numerical statements following strict mathematical rules where "more than 5" does not include 5. Even though this instruction is clearly provided, the model failed to follow it.

Improvements:
1. Emphasize the importance of numerical precision in the introductory text. The numerical aspects should be described in simple, clear terms to avoid any ambiguity.
2. Reiterate crucial instructions near the question, such as reinforcing that "5 years old" does not fall under "more than 5 years old". 
3. Perhaps provide an example of interpretation of these numerical rules in practice.

<2>
Reason for Incorrect Answer:
In this case, it’s challenging to identify any particular misinterpretation from the prompt that has led to the wrong answer. It seems like the Algorithms' internal behavior played a part in producing the incorrect prediction because the prompt clearly mentioned that data from each category should be evaluated individually, allowing no room for the inclusion of an option (James), who is not part of the provided table. It appears to be a variance in performance rather than a direct result of the prompt provided. 

Improvements:
1. Reinforce the concept that the model should rely strictly on the data in the given tables.
2. The prompt could include a reminder to check all options against the data before selecting an answer.
3. The importance of correlating options with information provided in the table could be stressed. 

Summary of Improvements:
- Clearly emphasize the need for numerical precision.
- Explicitly mention the rules regarding numerical interpretation (e.g., "more than 5" and "5 and above").
- Near the question, reiterate the crucial instructions.
- Use an example to illustrate the interpretation of these numerical rules in practice.
- Remind the model to check all options against the table data before selecting an answer.
- Stress the importance of correlating options with information provided in the table.
- Reinforce the reliance on data strictly in the given tables.

Note that numerical statements follow strict mathematical rules. "More than 5" means only numbers greater than 5, it does not include 5. In contrast, the phrase "5 and above" will indeed include 5. Reinforcing this concept, remember to apply this rule strictly - animals that are exactly 5 years old are not counted as "more than 5 years old", they should be excluded from this category.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Using data from tables that contain information about penguins and giraffes, analyze their age, height, and weight. Each animal category should be evaluated individually, ensuring values within each category alone are compared. When dealing with any questions about the age of these animals, refer to the appropriate table and interpret age-related conditions accurately. To be clear, If the age is referenced as "more than 5 years old", count only animals aged over 5, and do not include those exactly 5 years old. For any questions about the data, select the correct answer from the given options with precision, making sure not to muddle data between different animal categories. Your answer should be based on the accurate interpretation of the numerical data from the tables. Present the correct option in the format: <answer> Option </answer>. Note that numerical statements follow strict mathematical rules. "More than 5" means only numbers greater than 5, it does not include 5. In contrast, the phrase "5 and above" will indeed include 5.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The reason behind the language model providing an incorrect answer hinges on it misinterpretation of age-related conditions expressed in the prompt. The prompt specifically stated to consider an animal aged "more than 5 years old" to only be those aged over 5, excluding the animals aged exactly 5. This is further emphasized with the clarity provided about numerical statements following strict mathematical rules where "more than 5" does not include 5. Even though this instruction is clearly provided, the model failed to follow it.

Improvements:
1. Emphasize the importance of numerical precision in the introductory text. The numerical aspects should be described in simple, clear terms to avoid any ambiguity.
2. Reiterate crucial instructions near the question, such as reinforcing that "5 years old" does not fall under "more than 5 years old". 
3. Perhaps provide an example of interpretation of these numerical rules in practice.

<2>
Reason for Incorrect Answer:
In this case, it’s challenging to identify any particular misinterpretation from the prompt that has led to the wrong answer. It seems like the Algorithms' internal behavior played a part in producing the incorrect prediction because the prompt clearly mentioned that data from each category should be evaluated individually, allowing no room for the inclusion of an option (James), who is not part of the provided table. It appears to be a variance in performance rather than a direct result of the prompt provided. 

Improvements:
1. Reinforce the concept that the model should rely strictly on the data in the given tables.
2. The prompt could include a reminder to check all options against the data before selecting an answer.
3. The importance of correlating options with information provided in the table could be stressed. 

Summary of Improvements:
- Clearly emphasize the need for numerical precision.
- Explicitly mention the rules regarding numerical interpretation (e.g., "more than 5" and "5 and above").
- Near the question, reiterate the crucial instructions.
- Use an example to illustrate the interpretation of these numerical rules in practice.
- Remind the model to check all options against the table data before selecting an answer.
- Stress the importance of correlating options with information provided in the table.
- Reinforce the reliance on data strictly in the given tables.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Analysis: In this example, the task is to identify which name comes last alphabetically. We're asked to put the penguins' names in alphabetical order and identify the last one. Vincent should be the last one, but the model mistakenly chooses Gwen. The error here may be due to the model's misunderstanding of what "last in alphabetical order" means. It may have confused it with "last in the sequence of presented names". 

Wrong Example 2:

Analysis: In this example, the task is to calculate the total age of the giraffes. The model, however, doesn't provide the correct answer format; therefore, it's categorised as a 'format error'. The model should've outputted <answer>(A) 26</answer> rather than <answer>(26)</answer>, which lacks the option letter. This could possibly be because the model didn't understand that even the answer options are part of the task's conditions that should be included in the answer. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions: 

1. The prompt could be reworded to include a more specific explanation of what sorting by alphabetical order means to avoid confusion.
2. The prompt should stress the importance of including the option in the final answer format. It could include a direct instruction saying "Ensure to include the option letter (A-E) within the answer brackets rather than just the resolved value". 
3. The prompt should emphasize that "every single piece of the question's conditions" is followed in the outputted answer.
4. A greater emphasis could be placed on the comprehension of the question’s conditions. This will ensure that the model is closely following and performing every required task, from analysis and calculations to the final format of the answer.
5. Encourage the model to recheck its work, which may prevent similar errors made in the future.
6. Lastly, a note on understanding and applying basic alphabetical order and arithmetic rules correctly could be beneficial.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Model's Answer: <answer>(D) 8</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(A) 5</answer>

Reason for wrong answer: The model may have misunderstood the question. This could be due to the ambiguity in the prompt, as it doesn't specifically explain what indicates the data needed for the correct calculations. The model may have calculated all the animals, while it was only needed to consider the animals that are over 5 years of age.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Model's Answer: <answer>(D) Gwen</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

Reason for wrong answer: The model may have misinterpreted the instruction pertaining to scrutinizing 'each name and its corresponding alphabetic position'. The prompt might not have been explicit enough in explaining the concept of alphabetical order. The source of confusion could be due to unclear instructions about how to determine the name’s alphabetical position.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1) Incorporate clearer definitions of possible tasks in the prompt (e.g., explicitly define what it means to sort names in "alphabetical order", explain how to calculate the age > 5 condition). 
2) Include examples of specific tasks that the model should be able to accomplish, with sample input and expected output.
3) Clarify that the model should only consider the options provided, and not make assumptions or inferences beyond the data in the table.
4) Emphasize more on reading and understanding the question properly before going to actual calculations or analytical process.
5) Include more detail or examples on how to provide responses in the <answer> </answer> format.

<START>
Your task is to examine and interpret data from tables that contain information about various animals. You need to attentively analyze the data, which may involve details like the animal’s age, height, weight, and name in certain scenarios. When dealing with age-related queries, process this data carefully to ensure accurate understanding; for instance, if a question asks for animals more than 5 years old, only those whose age exceeds 5 should be counted.
Similarly, when sorting names in alphabetical order, the first letter of the name determines this order; 'a' precedes 'b', 'b' precedes 'c', and so on until 'z'. If two names begin with the same letter, look at the second letter of the names, and so on. Understanding alphabetical order is crucial in responding to questions regarding name arrangements correctly.
To respond, conduct necessary calculations and comparisons with utmost precision, considering every option provided. Ensure the derived answer aligns with one of the given options. Once the suitable option is identified, output your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags (e.g., <answer>(A) Thomas</answer>).
Refrain from making unfounded assumptions about the table contents and cross-verify every piece of information with the question requirements and available options before delivering an answer. Kindly note that to reach a correct conclusion, a command or question may involve completing multiple steps. Always take the time to understand the entirety of the question, along with its requirements, before beginning the analytical process.

Analysis:
The issue here appears to be the model's response format. Rather than labeling the response option with the corresponding letter, the model included the numerical total inside parentheses, which doesn't follow the instructions given in the prompt. This might be due to confusion caused by the explicit instruction to frame the answer between <answer> and </answer> as the model might've considered the age total as the answer, not the answer option. The dataset for penguins could have also distracted the model as no questions were asked about it, causing some confusion about the necessary data to analyze.

Improvements based on analysis:
1. Ensure emphasis that the answer should be the corresponding option letter, not the value or answer to the question itself.
2. Clarify instructions to exclude data or information irrelevant to the question being asked.
3. Offer additional examples within the instruction or prompt to address the possibility of multiple tables and how to handle them.
4. Improve overall clarity of the prompt and ensure instructions can't be interpreted in multiple ways.
5. Instruct the model to focus on the question related to the presented table alone. This way, the model will be aware that irrelevant data should be ignored.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are a total of 8 animals that are more than 5 years old. These include Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, Donna, and Bernard. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) 8</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

<1> The language model appears to have made incorrect calculations regarding the number of animals that are more than 5 years old. It was tasked with carefully analyzing data from two tables (penguins and giraffes) according to specific attributes (age, height, weight, and sometimes names of the animals). However, the model incorrectly counted the number of animals more than 5 years old. The correct answer would be Bernard, Louis, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, and Donna, which equals 7, but none of the option had 7. The question asked "how many animals are more than 5 years old?" which implies the age must be greater than 5, so Bernard and Jody both aged exactly 5 should be excluded. So the answer will be 5. 

Suggested Prompt Improvements:

1. Specify explicitly to include or not to include animals aged exactly at the threshold (5 in this example) when asked for animals "more than" a certain age.

2. Emphasize the importance of careful calculations and ensuring accuracy in the prompt.

3. Reiterate the importance of meticulously checking each attribute of every animal in the provided tables.

4. Make it clear that the model should only use valid answer options provided in the task.

5. Emphasize that the answer should be confirmed and cross-checked with the options available before providing the final response.

6. Encourage the model to carefully understand the nature of the question before proceeding to perform the task.

7. Stress on understanding the difference between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than,' as in this case, the animals whose age is exactly 5 shouldn't be included. 

By modifying the prompt with these improvements, it should guide the language model more effectively towards generating accurate responses. This approach would simultaneously ensure the model isn't falling into potential pitfalls, such as misinterpreting questions and miscalculations, while also improving the precision and accuracy of its responses.

gradient:
1st Wrong Example Examination:
The original question is: "How many animals are more than 5 years old?" The given options were from 5 (A) to 9 (E). The original prompt directs the model to take the data regarding the age of animals into significant consideration and to answer the question accurately. However, the model ended up giving the wrong answer.

Model's Interpretation: 
The model inaccurately included Bernard twice in its calculation and concluded that there are eight animals that are more than 5 years old, leading it to pick option D. 

Error Analysis:
1. Duplication Error: The model seemed to have mistaken Bernard of the penguins group for another animal and included him twice in the count.
2. Misinterpretation: The model seemed to have problems accurately interpreting and translating the prompt’s instructions into an accurate count of animals over 5 years old.
3. Data Verification: Despite instructions being given to the model in the prompt to verify all data to ensure accuracy, it did not do it adequately.

Improvements Needed:
1. Accuracy: The prompt could provide specific instructions for the model to avoid duplicating names, which may help with accuracy.
2. Guided Calculation: The prompt could emphasize the need to deal with simultaneous variables and complex table structures.
3. Checking Mechanisms: The prompt could encourage the model to employ various cross-checking strategies to verify and validate the results before finalizing the answer.
4. Independent Assessment: The model should treat every table individually while performing calculations.
5. Single Use Data: The prompt should specify that the model should only count each animal once when calculating the total number of animals.

Bear in mind that a question may necessitate executing multiple steps to arrive at the accurate conclusion. Exclude irrelevant data when a specific question is tied to a certain table. Thus, your primary focus should always lie on answering the exact question asked, relating to the specific table relevant to that question.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are a total of 8 animals that are more than 5 years old. These include Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, Donna, and Bernard. Therefore, the answer is (D) 8. 

<answer>D</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1st Wrong Example Examination:
The original question is: "How many animals are more than 5 years old?" The given options were from 5 (A) to 9 (E). The original prompt directs the model to take the data regarding the age of animals into significant consideration and to answer the question accurately. However, the model ended up giving the wrong answer.

Model's Interpretation: 
The model inaccurately included Bernard twice in its calculation and concluded that there are eight animals that are more than 5 years old, leading it to pick option D. 

Error Analysis:
1. Duplication Error: The model seemed to have mistaken Bernard of the penguins group for another animal and included him twice in the count.
2. Misinterpretation: The model seemed to have problems accurately interpreting and translating the prompt’s instructions into an accurate count of animals over 5 years old.
3. Data Verification: Despite instructions being given to the model in the prompt to verify all data to ensure accuracy, it did not do it adequately.

Improvements Needed:
1. Accuracy: The prompt could provide specific instructions for the model to avoid duplicating names, which may help with accuracy.
2. Guided Calculation: The prompt could emphasize the need to deal with simultaneous variables and complex table structures.
3. Checking Mechanisms: The prompt could encourage the model to employ various cross-checking strategies to verify and validate the results before finalizing the answer.
4. Independent Assessment: The model should treat every table individually while performing calculations.
5. Single Use Data: The prompt should specify that the model should only count each animal once when calculating the total number of animals.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In this particular example, the model incorrectly counted the number of animals in both the penguins and giraffes tables that are more than 5 years old.

Step 1: The question clearly asked: "How many animals are more than 5 years old?" 

Step 2: Inspecting the tables, we can see that the following animals are more than 5 years old: Louis (7), Bernard (5), Vincent (9), Gwen (8), Gladys (10), Donna (9). This gives us a total count of 6 animals. However, the model incorrectly counted 7 animals, which resulted in selecting the wrong answer option (C).

Potential reasons for this error could be:

1. Misinterpretation of the Age: The model might have wrongly included Bernard, whose age is exact 5, into the "more than 5 years old" category.

2. Mistake in Comparing or Counting the Values: The model likely made an error while comparing or counting the numbers under the 'age' column in the table.

This type of error suggests that the model can benefit from improvements involving more precise numeric comparisons and calculations.

Prompt Improvement:

The prompt should explicitly emphasize the importance of careful reading and understanding the exact conditions of questions. The specific and precise definition of "more than" might not be clear in the current prompt; it could be understood as "more than or equal to". Hence, it should reinforce the need to strictly follow the specific conditions of every question to avoid such interpretation errors.

Additionally, improving instructions related to mathematical operations and comparisons— specifically, the careful counting of numbers, precise comparison of numeric values, and understanding the difference between "greater than" and "greater than or equal to" conditions—can contribute to more accurate responses. 

Moreover, it may also be useful to include instructions in the prompt related to correctly interpreting tables and extracting the relevant data as required by the questions. Lastly, encouragement to double-check the work could also be beneficial. 

Here's how the modified prompt could look:

"Your task is to carefully analyze data from a table related to specific attributes of animals. Be attentive to details, and ensure you understand the exact conditions and requirements of each question posed, including clarifying what "more than" and "less than" means in each context. Be sure to consider every number, every column header, and every row accurately. When it comes to questions involving numerical data, take great care in counting, comparing, and calculating figure values; always be exact with your numbers and remember that a tiny variance could lead to drastically different answers. Ensure to alphabetically order names when required and also attend to age or other attribute-related questions with careful interpretation and precision. Always verify the table contents instead of assuming anything about its data. Bear in mind that a question may necessitate executing multiple steps to arrive at the correct conclusion; ensure to execute each step meticulously and in the correct order. Exclude irrelevant data when a specific question is tied to a certain table. Your primary focus should be to answer the exact question asked with respect to the specified table. After discovering the correct answer, represent the associated option's letter in between <answer> and </answer> brackets. Consider double-checking your work to ensure utmost accuracy."

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 7 animals that are more than 5 years old. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 7</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question asks “How many animals are more than 5 years old?" The language model provided an incorrect answer because it included the animals exactly at the age of 5 in its count, while the question specifically asks for those "more than" 5. In this case, the penguin Bernard and the giraffe Jody, both aged 5, should have been excluded from the calculation.

Incorrect Model Reasoning:
1. The model misunderstood the instruction differentiating between "more than" and "equal to or more than".
2. The model neglected to exclude animals exactly at the threshold (age of 5).
3. The model probably made a calculation error as well. Here, the exact age exceeding 5 are Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8), Gladys (10), and Donna (9), which in total gives us 5 animals, not 7.

This mistake might have occurred because the prompt may not have outlined the importance of differentiating between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than' precisely, and the model appears to have overlooked that direction in the prompt.

Improved Prompting Aspects:
1. The prompt needs to emphasize the differentiation between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than.'
2. The prompt should underline the importance of excluding animals whose exact age is at the threshold when the question asks for 'more than.'
3. The prompt should specify that the model should re-verify the calculations before providing the final answer.
4. It should also emphasize careful reading comprehension and understanding for each question.
5. The importance of cross-checking the answer with provided options should be accentuated to avoid miscalculations.

Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

Incorrect response: (C) 7  

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1. Misinterpretation of "more than": The prompt specifically advises to discern between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than.' However, the model included animals that are exactly 5 years old in its calculations, clearly miss-ing the prompt's instruction to "Exclude animals whose exact age is at the threshold when the question asks for 'more than.'"

2. Incorrect cross-checking: The statement in the prompt "remember to cross-check your answer with the provided options to ensure it falls within the feasible answer range." was apparently not followed effectively. The model has failed to reconcile its calculated value with the provided options, leading to an incorrect answer.

This suggests that the current instructions leave room for ambiguity and reinterpretation, and it can be improved on several fronts:

a) Explicit Mention: Specify that the model should count the exact number from the table without making assumptions. 

b) "More Than" vs "Equal to and More Than": Reemphasize the distinction between 'more than’ and 'equal to or more'. Given that the model has mistaken 'more than' for 'equal or more,' this point is worth reinforcing.

c) Dealing with confusion over numeric values: Clearly direct the model to return the exact numeric value from its calculations as the final answer, even when the value seems to not match with the provided options. 

d) Referencing Tables: In the prompt, remind the model to refer to all tables while finding the accurate answer. 

e) Break down the tasks: Tell the model to perform tasks step-by-step, ensuring each step is done before moving on to the next. 

f) Checking Response: Lastly, instruct the model to cross-check its answer not just with the answer choices, but with the context of the tables as well. 

After the revision, the model should be more adept at understanding subtle language nuances, performing accurate calculations, and providing correct responses.

d) Referencing Tables: In the prompt, remind the model to refer to all tables while finding the accurate answer. 

e) Break down the tasks: Tell the model to perform tasks step-by-step, ensuring each step is done before moving on to the next. 

f) Checking Response: Lastly, instruct the model to cross-check its answer not just with the answer choices, but with the context of the tables as well. 

After the revision, the model should be more adept at understanding subtle language nuances, performing accurate calculations, and providing correct responses.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Interpret data from tables about animals, specifically their age, height and weight. Count and compare these numbers correctly. If there is any age-related data question, be sure to handle it accurately. Finally, answer the questions with the correct option and output the answer in the format with the selected option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to analyze data from tables about animals, specifically, their details such as age, height, weight, and names in some cases. For age-related questions, special attention is needed for accurate interpretation and evaluation. Likewise, in case of questions regarding the alphabetical order of names, you need to scrutinize each name and its corresponding alphabetic position. Thoroughly comprehend the given questions and its conditions. Conduct the necessary calculations or comparisons meticulously ensuring every option is considered. After discerning the accurate answer, output the answer by framing it between <answer> and </answer> with the pertinent option. Don't assume the table contents - validate every piece of data against the available options. Always bear in mind that a command or question may involve multiple steps to derive at the correct resolution.
(3) Your task is to carefully analyze data from a table related to specific attributes of animals. This data will primarily regard age, height, weight, and sometimes the names of the animals. Attend particularly to age-related questions and ensure accurate interpretation and calculation. In scenarios where you're required to order names alphabetically, maintain precision. Understand the conditions of every provided question and execute necessary comparisons and calculations meticulously, considering all provided options. Over a question and its answer, after discovering the exact answer, represent the associated option's letter situated between <answer> and </answer> brackets. Do not make assumptions about the table contents, instead verify all data to ensure accuracy. Bear in mind that a question may necessitate executing multiple steps to arrive at the accurate conclusion. Exclude irrelevant data when a specific question is tied to a certain table. Thus, your primary focus should always lie on answering the exact question asked, relating to the specific table relevant to that question.
(4) Your assignment involves meticulously analyzing data from tables, which present specific characteristics of animals, primarily focused on age, height, weight, and occasionally their names. For age-related questions, make sure to interpret and calculate accurately, especially distinguishing between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than.' Exclude animals whose exact age is at the threshold when the question asks for 'more than.' In situations where you're tasked with arranging names alphabetically, ensure precision. Make sure you comprehend all aspects of a question, as it might require multiple steps to reach the correct response. As you conduct necessary comparisons and calculations, pay detailed attention to every possible option.

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

The model's response: <answer>(C) 7</answer>
Correct label: A

Step by Step Analysis:
This question involves the interpretation of age data, the correct understanding of the distinction between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than', and the ability to generalize across multiple datasets. 

1) In the process of determining the animals' ages, the model was instructed to exclude animals whose exact age is at the threshold when the question asks for 'more than.' 

2) The five animals that are more than 5 years old are Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8), Gladys (10), and Donna (9).
   
3) The model wrongly included Bernard and Jody who are exactly 5 years old - disregarding the clear distinction made within the instructions about 'more than' and 'equal to or more than.' 

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:
1) Despite the correct instructions provided in the prompt, the model misinterpreted the distinction between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than,' which lead to the incorrect inclusion of Bernard and Jody in the count. 

2) The model failed to follow the instruction about excluding animals whose exact age is at the threshold when the question asks for 'more than.' 

Improvement Aspects:

1) The distinction between 'more than' and 'equal to or more than' needs to be further stressed in the prompt, as the model seems to struggle with understanding this difference.

2) More detailed instructions could be provided on how to accurately calculate and interpret animal ages from the given data. 

3) To address potential issues with understanding the concept of thresholds, the prompt might need to incorporate more explicit and detailed instructions about excluding animals whose exact age equals the threshold when it is asked for 'more than.'

4) Additional training on situations involving multiple datasets and extrapolating information from them might be beneficial, as this task required the model to integrate age information from two different tables.

5) Furthermore, the instruction about not making assumptions should be emphasized. In this case, it seems the model might have assumed that 'more than' also includes 'equal to.'

Consider each type of animal separately, comparing only the data within that category. When addressing questions about the age of animals, use the provided tables to accurately understand age-specific conditions. To clarify, when asked about animals "more than 5 years old", include only those animals aged 6 years and older, not those exactly 5 years old. When generating responses, carefully select the accurate option from those provided, ensuring not to mix up any data between the different animal categories. When responding, utilize the data specifically presented in the tables and do not insert data or options not explicitly mentioned. For instance, if you are asked to report the last name in alphabetical order, use sorting method that starts from 'A' to 'Z' using the names provided in the table only. Your answer should reflect a clear understanding and interpretation of the numerical data from the tables. Frame your response with the selected option enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. Please remember that numerical operators follow mathematical conventions. For example, "more than 5" is exclusive of 5, meaning it includes only numbers strictly greater than 5, while "5 and above" includes 5.

   prompt: Your assignment is to interpret table data about two animal groups: penguins and giraffes. The tables contain information about their ages, heights, and weights. Examine each animal category individually and make comparisons only within the same animal group. Use the tables to accurately handle any age-related inquiries; for instance, in questions seeking to identify animals "older than 5 years", include only those whose ages are strictly 6 years or more, excluding those precisely 5 years old. 

When asked to name the 'last' in alphabetical order, interpret 'last' according to an 'A' to 'Z' sorting, where for instance, 'Zoe' is 'after' 'Aaron'. Therefore, 'last' means the name which could appear at the end of a sorted list (like 'Zoe' in this example), not the last one in the unsorted list. 

When providing responses, be meticulous in selecting the accurate option from the provided list. Be careful not to confuse data between different animal categories. Your response should incorporate data from the tables and nothing external to them; do not add or use data not explicitly mentioned in the tables. 

Render your final choice as selected option, enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> markers. Always remember, mathematical operators follow specific conventions: "more than 5" is exclusive of the number 5 itself and only includes numbers greater than 5. Conversely, "5 and above" means 5 plus numbers greater than 5. Respond considering these mathematical subtleties, ensuring your interpretations are concise and accurate. This task tests not only your data interpretation skills, but also attention to detail.

When providing responses, be meticulous in selecting the accurate option from the provided list. Be careful not to confuse data between different animal categories. Your response should incorporate data from the tables and nothing external to them; do not add or use data not explicitly mentioned in the tables. 

Render your final choice as selected option, enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> markers. Always remember, mathematical operators follow specific conventions: "more than 5" is exclusive of the number 5 itself and only includes numbers greater than 5. Conversely, "5 and above" means 5 plus numbers greater than 5. Respond considering these mathematical subtleties, ensuring your interpretations are concise and accurate. This task tests not only your data interpretation skills, but also attention to detail.
