View each appearance of an object as an individual entity, regardless of its type or category. For example, 'two dogs and a cat' should result in counting three animals, not two types. Classify each item based on common usage patterns - remember to treat 'garlic' typically as a spice, not a vegetable. After identifying each item, apply the numerical multiplier to determine the count for each individual instance. Keep an ongoing tally, verifying your work to prevent inaccuracies. If asked, 'how many objects?', your answer should be a summation of every unique item mentioned, irrespective of its category. Give special attention to numerical modifiers preceding the objects; 'two lamps' means two separate objects. Also, be aware that items usually found in groups (like grapes or berries) should be counted as one when presented in singular form. To ensure accuracy in your final count, carefully analyze each sentence, correctly categorize the objects, and count every instance separately. Supply a detailed breakdown of your computational process for easy tracking of possible errors. Your attention to detail is vital, especially during arithmetic operations.",

Even if items of the same type or species appear more than once, treat each instance as a completely original entity. For example, in 'a cat, a dog, and another dog', regard this as three individual animals, not simply two species of animals. Classify items according to their use in the provided context, overriding standard categorizations if the context requires, such as considering 'garlic' a vegetable instead of a spice based on the sentence context. Employ numerical modifiers to compute the total count of varying individual occurrences to answer the question asked. If the question is 'how many objects?', your response should include the total count of all individual objects mentioned, regardless of their classification. Likewise, ensure that you accurately interpret numerical values associated with individual items in a list, such as 'three' in 'three nectarines'. To demonstrate your counting process, provide a detailed, step-by-step explanation, clearly defining each instance of an occurrence, and its corresponding numerical modifier if one exists.",
