I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Michael thinks that Sophia assumes that man with tattoo is lying down in the sand next to a cow. Hypothesis: Michael thinks that man with tattoo is lying down in the sand next to a cow.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava assumes that Charles believes that a woman is applying lip makeup to another woman who seems to have some green in her hair. Hypothesis: Charles believes that a woman is applying lip makeup to another woman who seems to have some green in her hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise entails the hypothesis. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<3> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:

(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Abigail assuming that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line does not necessarily mean she assumes the tennis player is playing tennis. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1 & 2:
These examples involve evaluating complex sentences with nested assumptions (one person assuming something about another person's assumption). The model incorrectly predicts entailment in these scenarios. The prompt "answer questions about causal attribution" may have misguided the model into seeking a cause-effect relationship, despite the task actually being about whether the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.

Example 3:
In this situation, the model evaluates the relation as non-entailment while it's actually entailment. The player spiking the ball on the line logically implies they're playing tennis. "Answer questions about causal attribution" might have made the model focus too narrowly on explicit cause and effect, failing to recognize indirect implication.

Example 4:
This example is similar to examples 1 and 2 but with the relationship 'suspects'. Once again, the model incorrectly predicts non-entailment. Here, the prompt "answer questions about causal attribution" may have thrown off the model by erroneously directing its focus towards detecting cause-effect relationships.

Improvements:

1. The prompt can be modified to "Evaluate the logical relationships in the premise and hypothesis". This would direct the model accurately to what the task is about, rather than misleading it to seek cause-effect relationship.
2. Consider explicitly specifying in your prompt that the model has to consider nested assumptions, implications and different types of relations between entities in the sentences (like 'suspects', 'assumes' etc.).
3. The prompt could specify that the task involves not just direct cause-effect relationships, but also implied or indirect entailments.
4. The task description could clarify that the model needs to determine whether the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. This might help the model not to deviate from the actual task.
5. Finally, introducing a few examples of correct predictions in the prompt can serve as guidelines for the model.

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Joseph knows that Emma suspects that a group of young people pose for a picture in a field. Hypothesis: Emma suspects that a group of young people pose for a picture in a field. Options: (A) entailment (B) non-entailment

Wrong Answer: The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Correct Answer: A

Reason: The prompt may lead to a wrong answer because it does not clearly define what "causal attribution" means, leading to confusion. In this example, the task is about "entailment" or "non-entailment", which is a different concept. Causal attribution refers to how people explain the causes of behaviors and events, but here the model is asked to identify the logical relation between a premise and a hypothesis, which is a task more related to logical reasoning or comprehension rather than the determination of cause and effect. This seems to be the primary source of the misunderstanding.

Improvement: Be explicit about the concept of "causal attribution" in the prompt. For example: "Answer questions about how and why certain events cause other events (known as causal attribution)". For this specific task, however, a better prompt might be "Answer questions about the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses".

In addition, specific instructions for how to format the answer (as bracketed) might be better placed within the prompt itself rather than in the question, as the model may skip them or not interpret them as instructions.

Overall, the prompt should be tailored more to the specific requirements and objectives of the task to ensure it guides the model accurately.

gradient:
<1> 
In this case, the model incorrectly identifies the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as non-entailment. The premise and hypothesis are identical; hence, the relationship should be entailment. The prompt may be leading to this error because it asks the model to answer questions about "causal attribution," but this term isn't applicable to the entailment or non-entailment task. The bearing of causal relationships is a different task and may confuse the model.

<2> 
In this example, the model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as non-entailment, when it should be entailment. The premise and the hypothesis share the same broad concept. Again, the prompt's focus on "causal attribution" may be causing confusion, leading the model to more narrowly consider the specific wording of both the premise and the hypothesis (e.g., focusing on the discrepancy between "a man dressed only in a towel" and "a human not wearing any clothes") rather than the overall meaning.

<3> 
The model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as entailment here, when it should be non-entailment. The premise and hypothesis differ in the causal attributor. The problem seems to repeat: the prompt's emphasis on "causal attribution" might be leading the model to focus on the cause-effect relationship rather than on the direct comparison of the statements.

<4> 
Here, the model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as non-entailment; it should be entailment as the premise and hypothesis are identical. The model seems to be misguided by the prompt, again because it focuses on causal attribution, which does not directly align with the task of entailment or non-entailment identification.

<5>
In this case, the model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as entailment, even though it should be non-entailment. The premises and hypotheses are the same, but with differing attributors. As with previous errors, it again seems that the prompt is misleading the model by asking it to consider "causal attribution," rather than evaluating the identicalness of the statements.

Based on these reasons, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:
1. Replace the term "causal attribution" with a term that is more suitable for identifying entailment or non-entailment, such as "logical relationships."
2. Clearly define the task in the prompt - the model should evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis based on their wording and meaning, not on their potential cause-effect relationships.
3. Provide the model with more training examples that correctly differentiate between "identicalness" of the premise and the hypothesis and the "causal attributor levels", as they are core issues in these wrongly answered tasks.
4. The model should bracket the answer option with <answer> and </answer> as it was not consistently done in all examples.

Again, the prompt's focus on "causal attribution" may be causing confusion, leading the model to more narrowly consider the specific wording of both the premise and the hypothesis (e.g., focusing on the discrepancy between "a man dressed only in a towel" and "a human not wearing any clothes") rather than the overall meaning.

<3> 
The model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as entailment here, when it should be non-entailment. The premise and hypothesis differ in the causal attributor. The problem seems to repeat: the prompt's emphasis on "causal attribution" might be leading the model to focus on the cause-effect relationship rather than on the direct comparison of the statements.

<4> 
Here, the model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as non-entailment; it should be entailment as the premise and hypothesis are identical. The model seems to be misguided by the prompt, again because it focuses on causal attribution, which does not directly align with the task of entailment or non-entailment identification.

<5>
In this case, the model incorrectly identifies a premise-hypothesis relation as entailment, even though it should be non-entailment. The premises and hypotheses are the same, but with differing attributors. As with previous errors, it again seems that the prompt is misleading the model by asking it to consider "causal attribution," rather than evaluating the identicalness of the statements.

Based on these reasons, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:
1. Replace the term "causal attribution" with a term that is more suitable for identifying entailment or non-entailment, such as "logical relationships."
2. Clearly define the task in the prompt - the model should evaluate the relationship between the premise and hypothesis based on their wording and meaning, not on their potential cause-effect relationships.
3. Provide the model with more training examples that correctly differentiate between "identicalness" of the premise and the hypothesis and the "causal attributor levels", as they are core issues in these wrongly answered tasks.
4. The model should bracket the answer option with <answer> and </answer> as it was not consistently done in all examples.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because just because Abigail understands that two people play horseshoes does not necessarily mean that Ava believes that two people play horseshoes. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis logically follows from the premise because Michael's belief that Taylor remembers the scene implies that Taylor indeed remembers it. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> The first question seems to have confused the model because it did not correctly interpret the embedded belief structure. The premise states that Ava believes that Abigail understands that two people play horseshoes, which in turn implies that Ava has an internal representation of the idea that two people play horseshoes. Therefore, the hypothesis (Ava believes that two people play horseshoes) is entailed, but the model has failed to capture this complex reasoning. The prompt might be improved by emphasizing such indirect entailments and communicative assumptions.

<2> The second question illustrates a similar misinterpretation. The model incorrectly determined that Taylor remembering that blond boy in a striped shirt on the swing set was entailed from Richard's assumption regarding Taylor's memory. This is a mistaken interpretation because it relies on Richard's assumption, which may not accurately reflect Taylor's memories. The model could do a better job capturing these nuances, as the assumption of one person doesn't necessarily correspond to the thoughts or memories of another. Possible improvements to the prompt could include focus on the epistemic status of concepts (whose knowledge or belief it is) and how this affects the entailment status.

<3> The third question also dealt with an incorrect interpretation of assumptions and memories. Despite Michael thinking that Taylor remembered a certain event, it does not mean Taylor actually does. This causes a consideration for potential misinformation or lack of info on Michael's part. The confusion here relates to the distinction between an individual's thought of another's memory and the actual memory of the individual being considered. The prompt could emphasize the need to consider credibility, source of information, and distinction between thinking and reality.

Based on the above analysis, to improve the prompt, the following aspects could be considered:

1) Emphasize reasoning for nested or complex structures, especially where beliefs about others' mental states or information are involved.

2) Call attention to the critical distinction between people's assumptions about others' knowledge or memory and the actual knowledge or memory of the considered individuals.

3) Elaborate on the importance of evaluating the credibility, source, and content of information when deciding on entailment or non-entailment.

4) Highlight the interpretation of indirect entailment and communicative assumptions. 

5) Ask the model to scrutinize assumptions that could lead to false entailments.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
- The question here involves evaluating the relationship between a specific situation discussed in a premise and a general situation discussed in a hypothesis. The prompt doesn't specify clearly that such generalizations should be considered valid logical implications. The premise does imply that it's possible for children to play in the snow, even though it talks about a specific instance. The language model evaluated the relationship too strictly, assuming the premise had to establish that all children play in the snow to entail the hypothesis.
- This model response seems to mistakenly focus on the quantity aspect ("all children play in the snow") rather than the general concept ("children play in the snow"). This could be due to ambiguity in the prompt about what it means for a premise to logically entail a hypothesis.

Example 2:
- This question involves the complexity of nested assumptions. Though the situation described in the premise and the hypothesis is the same, the prompt does not make it explicit that the hypothesis about Thomas’ suspicion does not logically follow from the premise that it is James who assumes this. The model failed to discern this logical difference in whose assumption it is - ignoring the agents involved and only looking at the situations.
- There might be confusion with the nested nature of the statements. It seems the model took the content of Thomas's suspicion in both premise and hypothesis as valid for entailment, ignoring the change in the higher-level assumer (James to Thomas).

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Specify that the evaluation should account for the level of generalization or specificity involved in entailments. For example, a specific instance can entail a general condition.
2. Emphasize that who makes the assumption or claim is important and could affect whether the hypothesis follows from the premise. The entity or person to whom the assertion, belief, or action is attributed matters.
3. Include that hypotheses can follow from premises even if they're not explicitly stated, but are logically implied by the premise.
4. Clarify how to handle nested assumptions or conditions in premises and hypotheses, and how these could affect entailment.
5. Highlight that entailment is not necessarily bidirectional - the premise can entail the hypothesis without the hypothesis entailing the premise.
6. Consider including examples or more definitions of entailment and non-entailment to guide understanding. Also, consistent use of premise-hypothesis language throughout the prompt may reinforce the task.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, focusing not only on direct cause-effect relationships but also on indirect entailments, implications, nested assumptions, and different types of relations between entities in the sentences. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to provide your answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, focusing not only on direct cause-effect relationships but also on indirect entailments, implications, nested assumptions, and different types of relations between entities in the sentences. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to provide your answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: David assumes that Sophia assumes that there is a woman in a white tank top and camouflage pants with a big black belt on a stage holding a microphone. Hypothesis: Sophia assumes that there is a woman in a white tank top and camouflage pants with a big black belt on a stage holding a microphone.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis logically follows from the premise because Sophia's assumption is explicitly mentioned within David's assumption. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example: 

The model's input is incorrect because it does not respect the prompt requirement. It adds an extra layer of complexity "David assumes that Sophia assumes..." This unnecessary nested assumption causes the model to incorrectly analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The model is led to determine 'entailment' because, as per its understanding, the hypothesis is contained within the premise when it should have been 'non-entailment'. 

Step by step:

1. Extra layer: The model was fed with a complex setup "David assumes that Sophia assumes..." This extra nested assumption can confuse the model. 

2. Misinterpretation: Due to this extra layer, the model misconstrues the premise and the hypothesis relationship. It thinks that because the hypothesis is embedded in the premise, it's a direct entailment.

3. Incorrect Answer: Given the misinterpretation, the model selects 'entailment' as the correct answer, while the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'. 

Reasons:

1. Nested Assumptions: It seems that the model does not fully comprehend the complexity of nested assumptions. In this scenario, the model takes the second-layer assumption by Sophia as the true premise instead of the full sentence, which is actually David's assumption about Sophia's views.

2. Direct Entailment Misunderstanding: The model incorrectly applies the principle of direct entailment to an indirect relation, leading to the wrong answer. 

Improvements: 

1. The prompt should explicitly instruct the model to handle nested assumptions and clarify whether to focus on each layer of assumption independently or to consider them as a whole.

2. The prompt should elucidate the difference between direct and indirect entailment to prevent the model's misunderstanding. 

3. Lastly, add examples to the prompt that reflect different scenarios, including similar complex nested assumption cases, to help the model get a better understanding.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis is an entailment of the premise. Since Amelia suspects that David assumes a specific scenario, it logically follows that David indeed assumes that scenario. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

gradient:
<1> 

For this specific example, the prompt leads to a wrong answer due to a variety of reasons:

1. Overreliance on direct cause-effect relationships: The prompt lays significant emphasis on direct cause-effect relationships, even though this problem may require a deeper understanding of indirect implications and entailments. However, the model instead chose to establish a direct relationship between Amelia's suspicion and David's assumption, which is not necessarily accurate.

2. Incomplete understanding of personal beliefs and assumptions: The prompt warns the model to remain aware of people's assumptions and beliefs about others' knowledge. But the model is unable to fully grasp the distinction between Amelia's suspicion of David's assumed beliefs and David's actual assumptions. That is, just because Amelia suspects something about David's assumptions does not guarantee that David holds those assumptions.

3. Ignoring room for misinformation: The prompt suggests the model be cautious towards the whence of the assumptions and whether there is room for misinformation. However, the model fails to take into account the possibility of Amelia's suspects being false, which is a form of misinformation itself.

To improve the prompt based on these reasons:

1. The instructions could further stress the difference between people's beliefs or assumptions about others' knowledge/memory and the actual knowledge/memory of those individuals.

2. Insert explicit instructions for the model to consider the uncertainty inherent in beliefs and suspicions when determining if the hypothesis follows from the premise. It should not directly treat suppositions, beliefs or suspicions as facts.

3. The prompt should specifically guide the model to consider situations where misinformation may exist, including in the premise of the problem itself. 

4. The language model could be instructed to evaluate each entity in the problem independently before making correlations or relationships, ensuring a thorough understanding of each separate aspect. 

5. It could be useful to include guidelines in the prompt for the model to carefully evaluate and not make conclusions based solely on the words used in the premise, emphasizing logical deduction over surface level understanding.

prompt: You have a task to scrutinize and assess intricate logical relationships between given premises and hypotheses; this encompasses a thorough investigation of not only direct cause-and-effect relationships but also indirect entailments, implications, and multi-level assumptions. Make fine-grained analogies and utilize abstract reasoning to unveil potential types of relationships between entities. Consider the credibility, source, and content of information, as well as the epistemic status of every individual in the sentences. Understand that individuals' beliefs or assumptions about others' knowledge or memory may not always align with the actual knowledge or memory held by those individuals. An assumption alone may not necessarily equate to other people's thoughts or memories, or even reality. Be exceptionally cautious of where the assumptions originate from and whether there is room for misinformation, especially when assumptions or suspicions are in play—do not treat these as proven facts.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire my a building. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire my a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. The hypothesis is that Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. Since the premise explicitly mentions that Joseph assumes Amelia understands the situation, it does not necessarily mean that Joseph himself assumes the same thing. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is:
(B) non-entailment

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert knows that a young woman dressed up semi-formally is reading book and drinking in the sun, seated on a bench. Hypothesis: Robert knows that a young woman reads near the ocean.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis that Robert knows that a young woman reads near the ocean does not logically follow from the premise that Robert knows a young woman dressed up semi-formally is reading a book and drinking in the sun, seated on a bench. The premise specifically mentions the woman being seated on a bench, not near the ocean. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first example, the error occurs as the model does not interpret that Joseph's assumption about Amelia's understanding also implies Joseph's own understanding of the situation. This flaw arises from the model misinterpreting the sentence, assuming that Joseph's understanding is not directly stated in the premise.

For the second example, the error arises because the model got misdirected by the level of specificity in the premise, failing to abstract the general information that there is indeed a young woman reading, which Robert knows. The location, in this case, doesn't affect the basic fact that Robert knows a young woman reads.

In summary, the errors can be attributed to the following reasons:

1. Misinterpretation of complex indirect entailments due to the language model's inability to recognize that one's assumption about another's understanding implies that same person's understanding.

2. Failing to parse levels of specificity appropriately. It seems that the model is overly focused on matching the exact scenarios described in the premise and hypothesis. The task needs to be clarified to evaluate logical relationships and not exact matching details.

To improve the prompt, we might consider the following aspects:

1. Specify that indirect entailments and implications should involve recognizing that a person's assumption about another person's understanding generally necessitates that person's understanding.

2. Include examples or instructions that encourage the model to consider the basic facts or general information present in the premise and not to overly focus on the specificity of the situations.

3. Emphasize logical relationships involved and that the task requires understanding and processing of these relationships, not necessarily an exact match between the situations in the premise and hypothesis.

4. Highlight the importance of context, abstract reasoning, and understanding of underlying or unstated assumptions in the premise. Encourage the model to explore various possible interpretations and extract the core message rather than adhering strictly to literal meanings.

Take into account different levels of specificity, from microscopic details to abstract concepts, and identify the core facts or general information embedded within the context. Pay attention to the credibility, source, and content of the information, as well as the epistemic status of individuals mentioned. Note that a person’s assumption about another person’s understanding usually implies that person's own understanding. Keep in mind that what people assume or believe about others' knowledge or memory does not always align with the actual knowledge or memory of those individuals.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain. This does not necessarily mean that Charlotte actually thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain; it only indicates Abigail's perception of Charlotte's thoughts. Therefore, the hypothesis that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain is a non-entailment.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise states that Evelyn assumes Michael sees the lady taking photos of a horse, but it does not explicitly state that Evelyn assumes the lady is wearing a specific outfit. Therefore, the hypothesis is a non-entailment.

Question: Premise: Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain. Hypothesis: Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain.
Model's Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment

Reason: There might be some misunderstanding about the difference between others' perceptions of someone's thoughts or beliefs and the actual thoughts or beliefs of that person. In the prompt, there is an emphasis to distinguish between people's perception and people's actual state of knowledge. However, the given premise directly involves Abigail's observation of Charlotte's thoughts, making it an entailment, rather than a non-entailment.

Question: Premise: Evelyn assumes that Michael sees that a Lady in a Green and Black Jacket, and Blue pants, taking a Photos of a Horse. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that a Lady in a Green and Black Jacket, and Blue pants, taking a Photos of a Horse.
Model's Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment

Reason: The error is due to oversight in recognizing the core elements of the premise and matching them precisely to the hypothesis. The prompt, while emphasizing critical evaluation of available information and considering the possibility of misinformation, might have inadvertently lead the model to overcomplicate the analysis, failing to recognize simple, direct entailment.

Based on the above analysis, the following aspects could improve the prompt:

1. Distinguish Between Observation and Assumption: The prompt should be clear about the difference between actual observational statements about someone's thoughts and assumptions about someone's thoughts. The model needs to understand that if a premise states one person observes or sees another person's thoughts or actions, it entails that the observed thoughts or actions are indeed happening.

2. Avoid Overcomplication: While the prompt should encourage critical thinking, it should advise the model to not overcomplicate the analysis where it is not required. Direct entailment should be identified where it exists.

3. Enhance Understanding of Premise-Hypothesis Relation: Emphasize that the model needs to better match the premise content to the hypothesis, focusing on the core elements involved, even when these elements might seem wrapped in secondary information.

4. Frame the Question: The prompt could adopt a format where each question ends with a direct instruction related to the task in their ending, to re-orient the language model back to the original task. 

5. Clearer Guidance: Ensure the prompt provides clearer guidance on how to manage the information within the sentences, how to handle the source of assumption, and the need to align the hypothesis with the premise accurately.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
The task is to analyze and evaluate complex logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. This involves a deep examination of not just direct cause-effect relationships, but also indirect entailments, implications, and nested assumptions. Make micro-analogies and abstract reasoning to uncover possible types of relationships between entities. Focus on the credibility, source, content of information, as well as the individuals’ epistemic status in the sentences. Be aware of the distinction between people's assumptions or beliefs about others' knowledge or memory and the actual knowledge or memory of those individuals. Be aware that an assumption alone may not necessarily correspond to the thoughts or memories of others or be the reality. Be cautious towards the whence of the assumptions and whether there is room for misinformation. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and consider the various possible telligence or cognitive model at play, if any. Be critical about what would be logically implied versus what may merely be the product of assumption-fault-fallacy. Ensure to provide your selected answer with reasoning, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain. Hypothesis: Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain. This does not necessarily mean that Charlotte actually thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain; it only indicates Abigail's perception of Charlotte's thoughts. Therefore, the hypothesis that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain is a non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Evelyn assumes that Michael sees that a Lady in a Green and Black Jacket, and Blue pants, taking a Photos of a Horse. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that a Lady in a Green and Black Jacket, and Blue pants, taking a Photos of a Horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise states that Evelyn assumes Michael sees the lady taking photos of a horse, but it does not explicitly state that Evelyn assumes the lady is wearing a specific outfit. Therefore, the hypothesis is a non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: Premise: Abigail sees that Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain. Hypothesis: Charlotte thinks that three people are posing on the side of a mountain.
Model's Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment

Reason: There might be some misunderstanding about the difference between others' perceptions of someone's thoughts or beliefs and the actual thoughts or beliefs of that person. In the prompt, there is an emphasis to distinguish between people's perception and people's actual state of knowledge. However, the given premise directly involves Abigail's observation of Charlotte's thoughts, making it an entailment, rather than a non-entailment.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 
In this case, the model seems to have misunderstood the indirectness of the given premise and equated Taylor's belief about Joseph's knowledge with Joseph's actual knowledge. The prompt's directive that "a person’s assumption about another person’s understanding usually implies that person's own understanding" seems to have led the model to associate Taylor's belief with Joseph's actual knowledge, which is not directly confirmed by the premise. This leads to the incorrect answer selection of 'entailment'. 

Wrong Example 2:
The model appears to have focused too heavily on specific details in the premise, causing an incorrect 'non-entailment' prediction. The task of evaluating entailment doesn't imply that every detail must correspond, yet the model seemed to latch onto the fact that the tennis player's equipment was not explicitly mentioned in the premise, ignoring the understanding that a tennis player making an aggressive swing indirectly implies the existence and holding of a tennis racket. It appears the model overapplied the prompt's instruction about microscopic details and examining underlying assumptions to the extent that it ignored implicit entailments.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify the Guidance on Assumptions: Make clear that an individual's beliefs about another's knowledge cannot be assumed as the actual knowledge of the person in question. Belief is not equivalent to actual knowledge.

2. Direct Emphasis on Implicit Entailments: Give more explicit instruction that information does not need to be expressly stated in the premise to be inferred logically. An understanding of the context can fill in certain logical gaps.

3. Balance Specificity and Generality: Instead of emphasizing the importance of focusing on both microscopic details and abstract concepts, indicate that the model should strike a balance in considering both in relation to the logic of the context.

4. Enhance Understanding of Cause-Effect Links and Logical Relationships: Further emphasize that not every detail in the premise has to perfectly match with the hypothesis; rather, the main consideration should be whether the hypothesis could logically occur given the condition of the premise. 

5. Provide Better Guidance for Handling Misinformation: Strengthen the instructions about treating potential misinformation, clearly stating that it is not always a central element in entailment tasks. This will help the model avoid over-reliance on this factor.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles recognizes that a tennis player in blue shorts and a white shirt making an aggressive backhand swing towards the tennis ball. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not necessarily entail that Charles recognizes a person holding a tennis racket, as the focus is on the tennis player's attire and action rather than the specific equipment being used. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. <answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1: 
In this case, the model seems to have misunderstood the indirectness of the given premise and equated Taylor's belief about Joseph's knowledge with Joseph's actual knowledge. The prompt's directive that "a person’s assumption about another person’s understanding usually implies that person's own understanding" seems to have led the model to associate Taylor's belief with Joseph's actual knowledge, which is not directly confirmed by the premise. This leads to the incorrect answer selection of 'entailment'. 

Wrong Example 2:
The model appears to have focused too heavily on specific details in the premise, causing an incorrect 'non-entailment' prediction. The task of evaluating entailment doesn't imply that every detail must correspond, yet the model seemed to latch onto the fact that the tennis player's equipment was not explicitly mentioned in the premise, ignoring the understanding that a tennis player making an aggressive swing indirectly implies the existence and holding of a tennis racket. It appears the model overapplied the prompt's instruction about microscopic details and examining underlying assumptions to the extent that it ignored implicit entailments.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify the Guidance on Assumptions: Make clear that an individual's beliefs about another's knowledge cannot be assumed as the actual knowledge of the person in question. Belief is not equivalent to actual knowledge.

2. Direct Emphasis on Implicit Entailments: Give more explicit instruction that information does not need to be expressly stated in the premise to be inferred logically. An understanding of the context can fill in certain logical gaps.

3. Balance Specificity and Generality: Instead of emphasizing the importance of focusing on both microscopic details and abstract concepts, indicate that the model should strike a balance in considering both in relation to the logic of the context.

4. Enhance Understanding of Cause-Effect Links and Logical Relationships: Further emphasize that not every detail in the premise has to perfectly match with the hypothesis; rather, the main consideration should be whether the hypothesis could logically occur given the condition of the premise. 

5. Provide Better Guidance for Handling Misinformation: Strengthen the instructions about treating potential misinformation, clearly stating that it is not always a central element in entailment tasks. This will help the model avoid over-reliance on this factor.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, focusing not only on direct cause-effect relationships but also on indirect entailments, implications, nested assumptions, and different types of relations between entities in the sentences. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to provide your answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) The task is to analyze and evaluate complex logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. This involves a deep examination of not just direct cause-effect relationships, but also indirect entailments, implications, and nested assumptions. Make micro-analogies and abstract reasoning to uncover possible types of relationships between entities. Focus on the credibility, source, content of information, as well as the individuals’ epistemic status in the sentences. Be aware of the distinction between people's assumptions or beliefs about others' knowledge or memory and the actual knowledge or memory of those individuals. Be aware that an assumption alone may not necessarily correspond to the thoughts or memories of others or be the reality. Be cautious towards the whence of the assumptions and whether there is room for misinformation. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and consider the various possible telligence or cognitive model at play, if any. Be critical about what would be logically implied versus what may merely be the product of assumption-fault-fallacy. Ensure to provide your selected answer with reasoning, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) The task requires you to analyze, explore, and assess the logical relationships between presented premises and hypotheses. This involves a detailed examination, not only of explicit cause-effect links, but also implicit entailments, potential implications, and underlying assumptions. Take into account different levels of specificity, from microscopic details to abstract concepts, and identify the core facts or general information embedded within the context. Pay attention to the credibility, source, and content of the information, as well as the epistemic status of individuals mentioned. Note that a person’s assumption about another person’s understanding usually implies that person's own understanding. Keep in mind that what people assume or believe about others' knowledge or memory does not always align with the actual knowledge or memory of those individuals. Do take into account that an assumption may not necessarily portray the actual thoughts or memories of others or define reality. Be critical in evaluating the origin of the assumptions and the likelihood of misinformation. Assess if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, there might be different levels of cognitive principles involved and not every detail in the premise has to perfectly match with the hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella thinks that John remembers that a man is holding an accordion while leaning against a brown fence that overlooks some water. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man is holding an accordion while leaning against a brown fence that overlooks some water.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise because Isabella thinking that John remembers a specific scene does not automatically mean that Isabella herself thinks that the scene is happening. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. <answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining the provided example, we can delineate several reasons why the model leads to the wrong answer:

1. Insufficient Emphasis on Substance over Syntax: The model may be getting confused by the premise-hypothesis phrasing, resulting in it weighing the syntactic differences (like who holds the memory) more heavily than the semantic content (the event being remembered). The prompt could stress the need to focus on the substantive content of the premise and hypothesis, rather than getting caught up in syntax.

2. Misinterpreting Assumptions: The prompt instructs the model to "be critical in evaluating the origin of the assumptions and the likelihood of misinformation," which might be causing it to deduce that there is an inherent discrepancy between what Isabella thinks John remembers and what Isabella herself believes, leading to a 'non-entailment' verdict.

Subsequently, we could improve the prompt in the following manners:

1. Emphasize Substantive Content: Explicitly mention that the substance content of the arguments, rather than just the syntactic structure, should be the primary focus during analysis.

2. Clarify Assumptions: Amend the language in the prompt to communicate that assumptions don't necessarily result in misinformation and discrepancies. Point out that assumptions can sometimes align with reality, as in the provided example.

3. Provide Examples: Offering clearer examples during the prompt can guide the model towards the desired behaviour. This can be particularly beneficial while dealing with ambiguous situations or the interpretation of implicit data.

4. Reiterate Equality between Entities: Reinforce that what a person 'remembers' and what is 'thought of them remembering' should, until proven otherwise, be considered equivalent in forming the underlying logical relationship.

5. Reframe Instruction: Lastly, ensure instructions on thinking critically about 'origin of assumptions' and 'likelihood of misinformation' don't lead the model to unilaterally doubt every premise involving assumption and memories. It should balance scepticism and acceptance based on the given context. 

To conclude, the prompt can be enhanced by adding clarity, providing examples, and refining instructions to improve the model's performance in complex semantic scenarios.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail knows that Thomas believes that a photographer and assistant take a photo of a man in a suit and a woman in a dress in front of large white columns and a yellow wall. Hypothesis: Thomas believes that Abigail knows that a photographer and assistant take a photo of a man in a suit and a woman in a dress in front of large white columns and a yellow wall.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (A) entailment. <answer>(A)</answer> 
This is because the premise explicitly states that Abigail knows that Thomas believes a certain scenario, which implies that Thomas believes that Abigail knows the same scenario.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Premise: Ava understands that John assumes that it looks like the clown has fallen off the horse. Hypothesis: John assumes that Ava understands that it looks like the clown has fallen off the horse.

Wrong Answer: The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (A) entailment.

Reason: The model seems to have confused the logic here. While it's true that the variable components in both sentences are the same - Ava, John, and the clown falling off the horse, the cause-effect relationship is not exactly identical in the premise and hypothesis. In the premise, the cause is Ava's understanding of John's assumption, while the hypothesis suggests that John is assuming Ava's understanding. Part of the reason why the model gets this wrong could be due to the misplaced emphasis on the similarity of the details, as suggested in the prompt, rather than looking at the directionality of the knowledge and assumption.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Premise: Abigail knows that Thomas believes that a photographer and assistant take a photo of a man in a suit and a woman in a dress in front of large white columns and a yellow wall. Hypothesis: Thomas believes that Abigail knows that a photographer and assistant take a photo of a man in a suit and a woman in a dress in front of large white columns and a yellow wall.

Wrong Answer: The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (A) entailment. 

Reason: The model seems to again consider the similarity of components in both sentences to arrive at an entailment. But it overlooks that the source of the knowledge (who knows/assumes/believes) and the direction of the knowledge understanding (from whom to whom) are important factors that decide entailment or non-entailment.

Areas of improvement for the prompt:

1. Clarification of Directionality: The prompt could emphasize more on the directionality of the knowledge or assumption. Just because Ava understands about John's assumption does not automatically mean John is aware or assumes that Ava understands the same. 

2. Highlight Cognitive Elements: The prompt might better highlight that the cognitive elements (knows, believes, assumes, etc.) are crucial to analyze. The logic is not just about the details of the incident but also about who knows what and in what direction. 

3. Encourage Critical Analysis: The prompt can reiterate the need for a critical analysis of the cause-effect relationship and caution against the assumption that similar elements equal entailment. 

4. Dissociation of Details and Logic: The prompt could further stress that entailment is not based simply on the correlation of details but on the logical connectivity and directionality of the premises and hypotheses. 

5. Clearer Instructions: The prompt can also clearly instruct to assess the logical difference between a person's knowledge of another's belief and a person's belief about another's knowledge.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, focusing not only on direct cause-effect relationships but also on indirect entailments, implications, nested assumptions, and different types of relations between entities in the sentences. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to provide your answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) The task is to analyze and evaluate complex logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. This involves a deep examination of not just direct cause-effect relationships, but also indirect entailments, implications, and nested assumptions. Make micro-analogies and abstract reasoning to uncover possible types of relationships between entities. Focus on the credibility, source, content of information, as well as the individuals’ epistemic status in the sentences. Be aware of the distinction between people's assumptions or beliefs about others' knowledge or memory and the actual knowledge or memory of those individuals. Be aware that an assumption alone may not necessarily correspond to the thoughts or memories of others or be the reality. Be cautious towards the whence of the assumptions and whether there is room for misinformation. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and consider the various possible telligence or cognitive model at play, if any. Be critical about what would be logically implied versus what may merely be the product of assumption-fault-fallacy.

response:
<START> In this task, you are required to identify and evaluate not just the expressed cause-effect connections but also the subtle logical relationships between a presented premise and hypothesis. This calls for an in-depth investigation of explicit and implicit entailments, underlying assumptions, and potential implications. Discover the core facts or general information embedded at different levels of abstraction, from minute details to overarching concepts. Assess the credibility, origin, and content of information, as well as the epistemic positioning of the individuals mentioned. Notice that a person’s assumptions about another person’s understanding can often hint at that person's own understanding, but it does not necessarily confirm awareness or comprehension in the reverse direction. It's crucial to acknowledge that what people believe or predict about others' comprehension or memory might not entirely match with the actual knowledge or memory held by those individuals. Be mindful that an inference might not truly reflect the actual thoughts, beliefs, or recollections of others. Exercise caution and critical thinking when you apprehend the origins of assumptions, to evaluate the possibility of misconceptions or misinformation. Analyze if the hypothesis logically stems from the premise by choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Recall that there might be different cognitive processes at play and the presence or absence of certain details in the premise or hypothesis does not alone determine the entailment. Of paramount importance is to explore the core logical relationship, sometimes hidden underneath the surface details. Maintain a critical perspective while analyzing entailed information, as opposed to judgements purely resulting from assumption-induced misinterpretations. Validate your decisions on the relationship between the premise and hypothesis with clear reasoning. Any conclusions drawn should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.<END>

gradient:
For each example, the model is confusing the premises with the hypotheses due to the wording and structure of the prompt. The model is wrong in each scenario because it is not correctly identifying the sources of the information as described in the premises and the hypotheses. Let's analyze why the model led to the incorrect answer in each situation:

<1> The model fails to recognize the difference in the point of view between the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, Joseph thinks that Olivia understands, indicating a higher level of indeterminacy than in the hypothesis, where it is simply stated that Olivia understands. The model does not appear to distinguish between these layers of implication, leading to the incorrect answer of 'entailment'.

<2> The model seems to not realize that there is an alternation of roles between Richard and James in the premise and the hypothesis. The model assumes that 'entailment' is the answer, but in the hypothesis, it is suggested that James thinks what Richard remembers. It doesn't necessarily imply Richard remembers what James thinks from Richard's perspective.

<3> The model seems to disregard the change of the person recognizing the situation, leading to an incorrect 'entailment' outcome. In the premise, William recognizes something, but in the hypothesis, it is Charles who recognizes. Despite the scenario being the same, the perception can vary from person to person, hence it is not self-evident that Charles would recognize the same thing as William.

<4> The model does not successfully recognize the shift in understanding between Thomas and John, naming 'entailment' as the answer again. The premise states that Thomas understands John's suspicions. However, the hypothesis swaps these roles, saying that John suspects what Thomas understands. It doesn't necessarily mean that John's suspicions and Thomas's understanding are the same.

<5> The model again falls into the trap of not recognizing the difference in points of view in the premise and hypothesis. Robert's suspicion that Thomas understands is not the same as Thomas understanding, leading to the false assumption of 'entailment'.

From the issues identified, the following improvements to the prompt can be proposed:

1. In the prompt, emphasize more the importance of recognizing the point of view and roles in both the premise and hypothesis. Make this a step of the analysis process.
2. Enhance the task definition by instructing the model to deeply consider the different perspectives and assumptions that can shape the premise and hypothesis, rather than treating them as directly comparable statements.
3. Include a clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt to enhance the model's understanding, clarifying that difference in perspective or roles does not lead to entailment.
4. Encourage the model to question the implicit assumptions in the statements, as they might lead to deeper layers of meaning that affect whether the hypothesis follows from the premise.

gradient:
Example 1:

The mistake the model makes here is potentially due to two reasons. First, the directive "pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to" may have led the model to overlook the cognitive process in the sentence, focusing more on the point of view than the layered understanding required. Second, the phrase "Remember entailment is not necessarily bidirectional" might be misinterpreted by the model, as bidirectionality is not a crucial point in this specific example.

Example 2:

Once again the model could have been misled by focusing on the directive "whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to". Despite that the point of view and assumption are altered in the premise versus the hypothesis, the models still classes it as an entailment. Besides, the instruction "Remember entailment is not necessarily bidirectional" could be irrelevant in this scenario and instead adds to the model's confusion.

Example 3:

The same issues seem to arise in this example. The model might focus too much on who is perceiving the situation, rather than recognizing that the perception itself does not assure the veracity of the perceived. "Pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to" may have misled the model again in this case. And the reminder about unidirectional entailment might only add confusion.

Prompt improvement suggestions:

1. Substitute the directive "pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to" with a more clear instruction that tells the model to evaluate whether change in point of view or assumptions would alter the truth or fidelity of the statement.

2. Clarify or provide an explanation about entailments not necessarily being bidirectional. Illustrate this concept using examples to avoid misunderstanding.

3. Add tips to consider the possibility that beliefs, thoughts, recognitions, and memories expressed by individuals in the statements do not confirm their truth. These cognitive processes offer perspectives that may not align with the reality.

4. Explicitly remind the model that the premise implying the theme of the hypothesis does not necessarily warrant identical specifics.

5. Ensure to reiterate the importance of differentiating between direct and indirect entailments, emphasizing that a premise may indirectly imply a hypothesis without explicitly stating the same. Provide examples to clarify this point.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

The mistake the model makes here is potentially due to two reasons. First, the directive "pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to" may have led the model to overlook the cognitive process in the sentence, focusing more on the point of view than the layered understanding required. Second, the phrase "Remember entailment is not necessarily bidirectional" might be misinterpreted by the model, as bidirectionality is not a crucial point in this specific example.

Example 2:

Once again the model could have been misled by focusing on the directive "whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to". Despite that the point of view and assumption are altered in the premise versus the hypothesis, the models still classes it as an entailment. Besides, the instruction "Remember entailment is not necessarily bidirectional" could be irrelevant in this scenario and instead adds to the model's confusion.

Example 3:

The same issues seem to arise in this example. The model might focus too much on who is perceiving the situation, rather than recognizing that the perception itself does not assure the veracity of the perceived. "Pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to" may have misled the model again in this case. And the reminder about unidirectional entailment might only add confusion.

Prompt improvement suggestions:

1. Substitute the directive "pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to" with a more clear instruction that tells the model to evaluate whether change in point of view or assumptions would alter the truth or fidelity of the statement.

2. Clarify or provide an explanation about entailments not necessarily being bidirectional. Illustrate this concept using examples to avoid misunderstanding.

3. Add tips to consider the possibility that beliefs, thoughts, recognitions, and memories expressed by individuals in the statements do not confirm their truth. These cognitive processes offer perspectives that may not align with the reality.

4. Explicitly remind the model that the premise implying the theme of the hypothesis does not necessarily warrant identical specifics.

5. Ensure to reiterate the importance of differentiating between direct and indirect entailments, emphasizing that a premise may indirectly imply a hypothesis without explicitly stating the same. Provide examples to clarify this point.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reason:
The model made a mistake because it did not correctly understand the perspective from which the premise and hypothesis were written. In the premise, Joseph recognizes John's suspicions while in the hypothesis, the perspective is flipped, and John suspects Joseph's recognition. The two don't necessarily entail each other, and the model's answer didn't recognize this change in perspective.

<2> Reason:
Similar to the first case, the model failed to account for the change in perspective and the flow of information. The premise indicates Taylor thinks Olivia recognizes a certain situation, but the hypothesis reduces it to Olivia recognizing the situation. Taylor's belief is not evidence for Olivia's actual recognition, hence they don't entail each other.

<3> Reason:
In this case, the model failed to take into account that the premise discusses Olivia's belief about what James suspects, while the hypothesis only accounts for what Olivia thinks, stripping away James's suspicions. This does not necessarily mean that the premise entails the hypothesis.

In summary, the key issue in the prompt's performance seems to be a lack of sensitivity to changes in perspectives, beliefs, and assumptions, and understanding that these do not necessarily translate to entailments.

Improved Prompt:

Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, considering all possible logical implications. Focus not only on direct cause-effect relationships but also on indirect entailments, level of generalization or specificity, and nested assumptions. Pay close attention to changes in perspective, as they can radically alter the logical relationship. Ensure you understand that someone's belief or suspicion about another person's knowledge doesn't guarantee the truth or validity of that knowledge. Keep in mind that entailment is not necessarily bidirectional. Evaluate whether the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Select 'entailment' if the premise fulfills the conditions for the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if it does not. Bracket your answer between <answer> and </answer>. Always consider the complexity these issues may add to the task.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Assess and identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, and denote your response in the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Assess and identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, and denote your response in the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building. Hypothesis: Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. (A) <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Assess and identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, and denote your response in the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles understands that three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. Hypothesis: Charles understands that there are four people outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
(B) non-entailment

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis
In the example, the incorrect answer was chosen by the model. The premise states "Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall filled with drawings in a building," and the hypothesis sustains "Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall filled with drawings in a building." The only difference is the operational verb ‘assumes,’ which may change the logical relation based on the context. However, without additional context, the entailment should be the correct choice here, so the prompt probably isn't inappropriate, but the model seems to be misunderstanding the relationship between "assumes" and the rest of the sentence.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis
In the second scenario, the model provided an incorrect response as well. The premise is "Charles understands that three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it," and the inference is "Charles understands that there are four people outside." The hypothesis conceptually aligns with the premise and should denote ‘entailment.’ However, the model chose 'non-entailment,' implying that it may not comprehend the implications of the premise entirely.

Improvement Summary:
1. Since the model seems to be struggling with situation-specific contextual inferences, one approach could be to add more concrete guidelines about how to handle these types of situations.
2. Include examples of common entailment and non-entailment situations to make the logical relationships clearer.
3. Redefine the options to be more explanatory, e.g., an entailment option could be "Entailment (Premise explicitly provides the information in the Hypothesis)" and a non-entailment option could be "Non-entailment (Premise does not include the information in the Hypothesis)".
4. Encourage the model to consider the number of elements/people/things involved in both the premise and the hypothesis.
5. The model could benefit from considering a wider range of syntactical structures and language nuances, such as verb forms, assumed information, and logical links.

Step by Step Analysis:

Example 1: 
The statement presented as the premise states that "Thomas believes that Olivia assumes..." about the situation. The hypothesis statement is "Thomas believes that..." The discrepancy in both statements is Olivia's assumption, which has no relation or evidence in the given hypothesis. The model erroneously identified the relationship as entailment.

Example 2: 
The premise is "Abigail thinks that Evelyn understands..." which is based on Abigail's belief, not factual information about Evelyn's grasp of the situation. The hypothesis follows directly "Evelyn understands that..." The hypothesis makes a direct claim about Evelyn's understanding, whereas the premise only reveals what Abigail thinks Evelyn understands, hence the two statements don't entail each other. However, the model incorrectly identified them as entailing each other.

Example 3:
The premise revolved around "Ava believes that Evelyn recognizes..." and the hypothesis is "Evelyn recognizes..." The premise is presenting Ava's belief not concrete evidence about Evelyn's recognition. But the hypothesis is plainly stating about Evelyn's recognition. Thus, the two statements don't entail each other, despite the model predicting them to be an entailment.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:
1. The language model seems to have difficulty understanding nuances and complexities in belief-based statements. 
2. The model does not fully grasp the concept of entailment when belief or perception of one person about another's understanding is involved.
3. It appears to consider surface-level similarities between two sentences as evidence of entailment.

Improvements in Prompt:
1. The clarification on the difference between a person's belief about another person's understanding, and factual evidence of that person's understanding can be added to the prompt.
2. The detailed explanation and examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' concepts with respect to belief-based statements could be included.
3. The model would benefit from instructions emphasizing critical reading and full understanding of the presented premises and hypotheses. 
4. The importance of evaluating the evidence, not just the similarity in statement structure, can be highlighted in the prompt.

gradient:
Examining Example 1: 
The model incorrectly identified the relationship between the premise and hypothesis as 'entailment'. The premise includes an element of uncertainty because it is rooted in 'Ava's suspicion', which doesn't confirm if Emma actually learned the specified information. Therefore, the correct answer should have been 'non-entailment'. The language model incorrectly identified the presence of the same entities in both sentences as entailment instead of evaluating the truth and certainty values expressed via words like "suspect".

Examining Example 2: 
The model did the same mistake here as well. The premise is based on 'Charlotte's assumption', adding a layer of uncertainty that does not guarantee that Michael assumes the guitarist performs a rocking solo. Therefore, the correct answer would be 'non-entailment'. 

These two examples suggest that while the language model can identify the presence of similar entities within the sentences, it is struggling to understand the impact of uncertainty introduced by words such as "assumes" and "suspects".

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Instructions could stress not only the identification of the entities present in both sentences but also the certainty and truth value of the statements. This should make it clearer that the presence of uncertainty, speculation, or assumption in the premise does not automatically lead to entailment.

2. Provide examples of how 'assumptions' or 'suspicions' impact the certainty of the relationship between premises and hypothesis. This would provide the language model an explicit example of how to handle these types of situations.

3. Also guide the model to pay careful attention towards entailment in context of truth values rather than only coherent textual presence. 

4. It could also be beneficial to provide clearer instructions about how to handle situations when assumption or suspicion is involved. E.g., "If the premise is based on an assumption or suspicion, the relationship with the hypothesis is often non-entailment."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, placing emphasis on the nuanced role of personal beliefs and assumptions.

Premise: Richard thinks that Isabella thinks that five young indian girls dress in colorful dresses are holding hands and smiling forming a circle. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that five young indian girls dress in colorful dresses are holding hands and smiling forming a circle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because David remembers that Richard assumes something does not necessarily mean that the assumption is true. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

This example goes wrong because the model seemingly understands the concept of terms being nested within one another (Richard thinking that Isabella thinks something), but does not realize the logical implications of this. Specifically, the fact that the premise does not provide direct evidence of Isabella's thoughts, only Richard's assumption about them, seems to be missed by the model. As a result, the model incorrectly identifies the relationship between the premise and hypothesis as 'entailment'. 

Example 2: 

The model errs in this example due to an overly skeptical interpretation of the role of personal beliefs. The model seems to concern itself with the truth value of the 'assumption' that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd - which is not necessary in this case. As stated in the prompt, the model should make a decision based on whether the premises entail the facts in the hypothesis, not on the actual validity of these facts. Given the details of this task, Richard's assumption about a couple dancing is seen as a 'fact' about his views, regardless of whether it is ultimately true. Therefore, the premise should have been seen to entail the hypothesis.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Specify that the task is about the logical relationship of the given statements, not about the truthfulness of the contents of those statements.
   
2. Make it clear that the premise stating someone's belief about another person's belief does not entail that the second person indeed holds that belief, to avoid confusion where the model may understand this incorrectly.
   
3. Explicitly state that the model should treat the individuals' reported beliefs or assumptions as factual within the context of each statement. Essentially, in this task, someone's reported belief or assumption is to be considered factual information about their state of mind, not the truth or falsity of the external situation.

By addressing these issues in the prompt, the model should be more accurately guided to correctly interpret complex interactions between personal beliefs, assumptions, evidence, and entailment.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the given example, the model incorrectly equated the belief of one person (David) regarding the belief of another person (Joseph), as equivalent to the actual belief of the person (Joseph). The prompt asked to focus on the difference between someone's belief about another person's understanding and factual evidence of that person's understanding. However, the model may not have adequately distinguished between these two concepts, leading to the inaccurate classification of the relationship as 'entailment' rather than 'non-entailment'.

Reason 1: Lack of Clarity in Instructions
The prompt provides a general direction to take into account the difference between one person's belief regarding another's understanding versus the actual understanding of the latter. However, it does not explicate further on how to make this distinction. This could potentially lead to confusion or misinterpretation, as seen in this example.

Reason 2: Complexity of Scenario
The prompt asks to analyze the premises and hypotheses that involve multi-layered beliefs, which adds an extra layer of complexity. In the case above, it involves David's beliefs about Joseph's beliefs. This complexity may result in errors in understanding and in generating correct responses.

Reason 3: Ambiguity in the Meaning of 'Entailment'
While the prompt defines 'entailment', the model may not have comprehended how to apply this appropriately in the nuanced scenario of the belief of one person about the belief of another.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Instructions: The prompt needs to more explicitly explain how to delineate between someone's belief about another's understanding and the actual understanding of the other person. This would help in proper differentiation and reduce inaccurate interpretations.
2. Simplicity: The complexity of the scenarios should be reduced, particularly in scenarios where one person's belief about another person's understanding is involved. It will make it easier for the model to analyze and understand.
3. Definition of 'Entailment': It would be beneficial to further clarify the meaning of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', particularly within the context of beliefs and assumptions, and provide more examples for better comprehension.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James recognizes that Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice. Hypothesis: Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not directly entail the hypothesis as it only states that James recognizes Charles believes something, but it does not guarantee the truth of what Charles believes. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom. Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. William's belief that the man is sweeping with a red broom does not necessarily entail his belief about what the man is sweeping. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:

Step 1: The question asks for the relation between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise here states that "James recognizes that Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice". The hypothesis is "Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice".

Step 2: The model incorrectly identifies the relation as non-entailment (option B). Whereas the relation is entailment (option A) because the premise and the hypothesis are identical in the sense of Charles' belief.

Step 3: The prompt's instruction about an entailment being the truth of the hypothesis being necessarily guaranteed by the premise led the model to erroneously conclude non-entailment.

Reason for mistake: The model seemed to bog down in scrutinizing the surface of the text, and misunderstood the task which is focusing on analyzing the nuanced role of personal beliefs and assumptions in entailment.

Wrong example 2:

Step 1: The premise is "William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom"; the hypothesis is "William believes that the man is sweeping dirt".

Step 2: The model wrongly classifies this as non-entailment (option B), incorrectly reasoning that the specifics of what the man is sweeping aren't included in premise. 

Step 3: The model seems to be getting confused by the slight changes in the wording between the premise and the hypothesis, which is a deviation from the prompt's instruction on not relying solely on the similarity of the sentence structures.

Reason for mistake: Confusion seems to stem from a lack of accurate interpretation of the entailment concept when it gets down to the minute details of the premise and the hypothesis.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Encourage the model to take into account that 'entailment' can still be valid even when the premise and the hypothesis aren't identical but logically related.
2. The prompt can be simpler and more straightforward to ensure the AI's understanding.
3. The prompt should emphasize and further explain the difference between beliefs and factual evidence.
4. It would be helpful to lead the model to focus more on the relational aspect of entailment rather than the literal similarity of the sentences.
5. The prompt should provide more specific guidance on how to analyze the nuanced role of personal beliefs and assumptions in entailment.

Premise: Thomas suspects that Emma sees that a woman in orange sunglasses is playing the drums while speaking into a microphone in front of a large sign. Hypothesis: Thomas suspects that a woman in orange sunglasses is playing the drums while speaking into a microphone in front of a large sign.

gradient:
Step by Step Analysis:

1. This is a nuanced prompt that involves understanding 'entailment' in the context of personal beliefs, assumptions, and their implications. The wrong answer suggests the model struggled to unwind the complexity in the layering of someone's belief about another person's belief.

2. The model needs to understand that the premise doesn't suggest that the woman in orange sunglasses is playing the drums, but that Thomas suspects Emma sees it. The hypothesis simply presents Thomas suspects the situation, removing Emma as the intermediary. The premise does indeed entail the hypothesis, as it doesn't counter the suspicion of Thomas.

3. The model may have erroneously interpreted the premise as suspecting two degrees of thoughts (Thomas's thought about Emma's thought). And when the hypothesis reduced to just one degree of thoughts (Thomas's thought about a situation), the model may have judged it as a 'non-entailment'.

4. The model possibly struggled in assigning the contextual weight and likely overlooked the fact that the belief of Thomas is the crux in both sentences, which suggests an 'entailment'.

5. Another possible misunderstanding could be that the model might have assumed that the reduction in complexity (removing Emma's sighting from hypothesis), makes it a non-entailment as this makes the hypothesis statement more straightforward than the premise.

Improvement Aspects:

1. The prompt should have clearer instructions regarding the conditions of 'entailment' especially in cases where multiple layers of character beliefs are involved.

2. Including concrete examples could better guide the model, giving it a better understanding of how to analyze premises and hypotheses where a person’s beliefs about another’s beliefs are involved.

3. The prompt should emphasize understanding and focusing on the consistency of the core belief in the premise and hypothesis rather than the complexity or simplicity of the sentence structures.

4. The model should be directed to assess that a direct transition from complex relational dependencies to simpler ones doesn’t invalidate the 'entailment'.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas suspects that Emma sees that a woman in orange sunglasses is playing the drums while speaking into a microphone in front of a large sign. Hypothesis: Thomas suspects that a woman in orange sunglasses is playing the drums while speaking into a microphone in front of a large sign.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Step by Step Analysis:

1. This is a nuanced prompt that involves understanding 'entailment' in the context of personal beliefs, assumptions, and their implications. The wrong answer suggests the model struggled to unwind the complexity in the layering of someone's belief about another person's belief.

2. The model needs to understand that the premise doesn't suggest that the woman in orange sunglasses is playing the drums, but that Thomas suspects Emma sees it. The hypothesis simply presents Thomas suspects the situation, removing Emma as the intermediary. The premise does indeed entail the hypothesis, as it doesn't counter the suspicion of Thomas.

3. The model may have erroneously interpreted the premise as suspecting two degrees of thoughts (Thomas's thought about Emma's thought). And when the hypothesis reduced to just one degree of thoughts (Thomas's thought about a situation), the model may have judged it as a 'non-entailment'.

4. The model possibly struggled in assigning the contextual weight and likely overlooked the fact that the belief of Thomas is the crux in both sentences, which suggests an 'entailment'.

5. Another possible misunderstanding could be that the model might have assumed that the reduction in complexity (removing Emma's sighting from hypothesis), makes it a non-entailment as this makes the hypothesis statement more straightforward than the premise.

Improvement Aspects:

1. The prompt should have clearer instructions regarding the conditions of 'entailment' especially in cases where multiple layers of character beliefs are involved.

2. Including concrete examples could better guide the model, giving it a better understanding of how to analyze premises and hypotheses where a person’s beliefs about another’s beliefs are involved.

3. The prompt should emphasize understanding and focusing on the consistency of the core belief in the premise and hypothesis rather than the complexity or simplicity of the sentence structures.

4. The model should be directed to assess that a direct transition from complex relational dependencies to simpler ones doesn’t invalidate the 'entailment'.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess and identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, and denote your response in the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
(2) Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, placing emphasis on the nuanced role of personal beliefs and assumptions. Identify the logical relationships between them, focusing on the concept of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', taking into account the difference between someone's belief about another person's understanding and factual evidence of that person's understanding. Remember, 'entailment' means the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily guaranteed by the premise. If premises are based on personal beliefs or assumptions, verify whether these directly entail the facts in a hypothesis before making your decision. Your response should not be based solely on the similarity of the sentence structures but the evidence presented. Denote your choice among provided options using the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
(3) Analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with precision, honing in on the intricate implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember, 'entailment' means the certainty of the hypothesis being true is inherently guaranteed by the premise. A key distinction to bear in mind is the difference between someone's belief about another person's belief and factual evidence of that person's belief. Essentially, in these tasks, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they are considered as facts about the state of mind of the individual and not the truth or falsity of the external situation they refer to. If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief. Examine if these 'mental facts' directly entail the hypothesis before making a determination.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your challenge is to critically analyze and ascertain the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, focusing on fine details related to personal beliefs and assumptions. Concentrate on understanding 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in depth. 'Entailment' is when the premise inherently guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this task, keep in mind that you're interpreting beliefs stated in the premise not as truth or falsity of what they speak of, but as statements about people's mental states. If a premise involves someone's belief about someone of third party's McLlegit (for instance, Tom believes Sarah thinks X), understand that it doesn't automatically mean the third person (Sarah in this case) indeed has that belief. In simpler terms, you are tasked to recognize the consistency of the suspicions and assumptions of the original thinker (Tom) in the premise when comparing with the hypothesis. Do not solely rely on the complex or simple nature of sentence structures but rather on the essence of the belief or suspicion conveyed by the author of the premise. Your final decision should be firmly based on logical evidence. Present your answer in the form <answer>Option choice</answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James believes that Joseph recognizes that a middle-aged man chef is in a white doorway of a mobile kitchen. Hypothesis: James believes that a middle-aged man chef is in a white doorway of a mobile kitchen.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Firstly, let's examine the wrong example's premise and the hypothesis:
Premise: James believes that Joseph recognizes that a middle-aged man chef is in a white doorway of a mobile kitchen.
Hypothesis: James believes that a middle-aged man chef is in a white doorway of a mobile kitchen.

Following the correct interpretation of these statements, the hypothesis is, in fact, entailed in the premise. The model incorrectly identified this as a non-entailment. Let's explore why this might have happened.

1. Processing nested mental states: The prompt specifies that when a premise includes someone's beliefs about another person's belief, it does not necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief. While this s correct, it seems like the model might be overgeneralizing this principle. The current phrasing might lead the model to assume that nested beliefs can never entail personal beliefs. However, the case here involves entailment within the scope of James’ beliefs and does not assert Joseph's beliefs. So the entailment still holds.

2. Lack of clarity in the 'entailment' definition: Though the definition of 'entailment' is given, it may not be clear enough in terms of beliefs. Clarification that entailment can occur within the belief of a single individual (even when referring to the beliefs of others) could be beneficial.

3. Overemphasis on factual evidence: The current prompt repeatedly emphasizes factual evidence. This might be causing the model to look for strictly objective relationships between the premise and the hypothesis, which is not always necessary in the case of personal beliefs hypotheses.

To improve the prompt, we can:

a. Provide more clarity on nested mental states: The prompt should specifically mention entailment can occur within the scope of an individual's beliefs, even if these involve beliefs about another's beliefs.

b. Enhance the 'entailment' definition: A clearer, more expansive definition of 'entailment' that fit the context of beliefs could help the model avoid mistakes.

c. Balance the focus on factual evidence: While it's important not to jump to conclusions about someone's beliefs, the prompt should also emphasize that the required analysis is within the context of the provided premises, which may not always align with strict, objective facts.

Premise: Thomas sees that Richard believes that a man with a red beard and mustache is smiling and wearing a hat crocheted with green yarn and Miller beer cans. Hypothesis: Richard believes that a man with a red beard and mustache is smiling and wearing a hat crocheted with green yarn and Miller beer cans.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. The fact that Thomas sees that Richard believes something does not guarantee that Richard actually holds that belief. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model incorrectly analyzes the premise and hypothesis relationship. It determines them to be non-entailing (Option B: non-entailment), while the correct answer is entailing (Option A: entailment).

Step 1: 
The model started the analysis by processing the premise: "Thomas sees that Richard believes that a man with a red beard and mustache is smiling and wearing a hat crocheted with green yarn and Miller beer cans." 

Step 2:
The model then analyzed the hypothesis: "Richard believes that a man with a red beard and mustache is smiling and wearing a hat crocheted with green yarn and Miller beer cans."

Step 3:
The model incorrectly determined that the premise and the hypothesis are non-entailing. It concluded that just because Thomas sees that Richard believes something, it doesn't ensure that Richard actually holds that belief.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Misinterpretation of Beliefs: The model might have taken the instruction "If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief," to mean that the beliefs are always non-entailing.
   
2. Complex Sentences: The complex nature of the sentences might have led the model to focus more on the structure, rather than the logical connections between the statements.

3. Confusion with Indirect Beliefs: The model might have construed that Thomas's observation of Richard's belief as indirect and, hence, non-entailing.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Clarification on Indirect Beliefs: The prompt should specify scenarios where beliefs observed by a third party can also be considered entailing, as in this scenario where a third person 'sees' that belief.

2. Emphasize on 'Mental Facts': The prompt could iteratively emphasize that the decision should focus on 'mental facts' represented in the premise and hypothesis and not the structural complexity of the sentences.

3. Detailed Instructions: The prompt should provide more detailed instructions on handling beliefs and assumptions. For instance, it could add examples to illustrate both entailing and non-entailing scenarios of beliefs. 

4. Clear Definitions: Reiterate the definitions, emphasising the difference between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with precision, honing in on the intricate implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember, 'entailment' means the certainty of the hypothesis being true is inherently guaranteed by the premise. A key distinction to bear in mind is the difference between someone's belief about another person's belief and factual evidence of that person's belief. Essentially, in these tasks, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they are considered as facts about the state of mind of the individual and not the truth or falsity of the external situation they refer to. If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief. Examine if these 'mental facts' directly entail the hypothesis before making a determination. Your decision should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence presented. Indicate your choice among the options given, structuring your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

<START> Your task is to dissect the given premises and hypotheses, particularly focusing on the complex influences of personal beliefs and assumptions. You're required to uncover the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, calling for a profound understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember that 'entailment' implies that the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily ensured by the premise. In these tasks, regardless of whether the beliefs within the premise are presumptions, they are to be interpreted as factual representations of the individual's inner state of mind, not the objective truth or falsehood of the external situation to which they refer. When a premise refers to one person's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT always infer that the second person actually harbors that belief. Particularly, when third person's 'seeing' or 'observing' the belief is stated, it may entail that the second person does hold the belief. Critically examine if these 'mental facts' assure the hypothesis before making a conclusion. Your conclusion should not merely rely on structural similarity of sentences, but on the logical inference it offers. Indicate your choice amongst the options provided, framing your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>. In all cases, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' is all about the logical certainty ensured by the premise, not the complexity or simplicity of sentences used.<END>

cur_prompt: Thoroughly analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with care, most particularly focusing on the intricate constructs of personal beliefs and their connections to assumptions. Your challenge is to define the logical bonds between them while using a nuanced understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to conditions where the truth of the hypothesis is innately ensured by the premise. Take note of a crucial distinction: one person's belief about another person's belief is not the same as concrete evidence of that the second person holds that belief. Essentially, in this task, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they serve as mental facts about the individual's state of mind, rather than the external truth or untrue nature of the situation being referred to. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not necessarily entail that Person B indeed holds that belief. However, it's important to remember that entailment can still occur within the scope of Person A's beliefs. Your objective is to dismantle these 'mental facts' and examine whether they directly lead to the hypothesis. Draw your conclusions based not on the structural similarity between sentences but on the logical proof presented. Record your choice from the options provided, with your response structured as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the given example, the language model is requested to determine whether the truth of the hypothesis is innately ensured by the premise or not. Here, the premise is that Olivia suspects a "gymnast" (which is a gender-neutral term mostly related to women in context) is seen defying gravity. And the hypothesis is that Olivia suspects that the gymnast is a woman. It seems like the model failed to recognize the context clues in the sentence structure. In the given context, 'entailment' is the correct label as the gymnast performing an impressive move is mostly correlated with women in the societal context and this logically ensures Olivia's suspicion.

Potential Improvements to Prompt:

1. Context Understanding: Increase the prompt's emphasis on context understanding. This might assist the model in making more informed decisions as assumptions sometimes could be determined by the context. A slight adjustment helping the model to look for societal contexts or gender-specific roles might improve its prediction capabilities.
   
2. Clarify terminology: The definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' might not be clear enough for the model. There is a need to incorporate more clear and concrete examples about these terms in the prompt.

3. Emphasize logical connections: The model incorrectly answered the question, thus there should be more emphasis on identifying logical connections between premises and hypotheses. 

4. Incorporation of Indirect entailment: Make it clear that in the interest of finding entailment, the model can infer based on generally accepted societal roles or positions. In the given case, this would mean that the model infers that when a gymnast is referred to without specific gender assignment, it's frequently assumed to be a woman.

5. Clarity on Beliefs: The current prompt considers beliefs as 'mental facts', suggesting they are undeniable within the scope of the individual. This can be more simply stated to avoid confusing the model. 

6. Examples in the Prompt: The prompt can also include a few solved examples which show both entailment and non-entailment cases. This will help the model understand what exactly is expected when asked for entailment or non-entailment.  

7. Simplify the Language: The current prompt is a bit complicated with too many aspects to consider. Simplifying the language of the prompt might make it easier for the model to focus on the important elements.

8. Improve instruction clarity: The instructions could provide clearer guide on how to record and structure the answer. 

By considering these factors, the prompt can potentially be improved and increase the model's accuracy.

(2) Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, placing emphasis on the nuanced role of personal beliefs and assumptions. Identify the logical relationships between them, focusing on the concept of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', taking into account the difference between someone's belief about another person's understanding and factual evidence of that person's understanding. Remember, 'entailment' means the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily guaranteed by the premise. If premises are based on personal beliefs or assumptions, verify whether these directly entail the facts in a hypothesis before making your decision. Your response should not be based solely on the similarity of the sentence structures but the evidence presented. Denote your choice among provided options using the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
(3) Analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with precision, honing in on the intricate implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember, 'entailment' means the certainty of the hypothesis being true is inherently guaranteed by the premise. A key distinction to bear in mind is the difference between someone's belief about another person's belief and factual evidence of that person's belief. Essentially, in these tasks, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they are considered as facts about the state of mind of the individual and not the truth or falsity of the external situation they refer to. If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief. Examine if these 'mental facts' directly entail the hypothesis before making a determination. Your decision should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence presented. Indicate your choice among the options given, structuring your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>.
(4) Thoroughly analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with care, most particularly focusing on the intricate constructs of personal beliefs and their connections to assumptions. Your challenge is to define the logical bonds between them while using a nuanced understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to conditions where the truth of the hypothesis is innately ensured by the premise. Take note of a crucial distinction: one person's belief about another person's belief is not the same as concrete evidence of that the second person holds that belief. Essentially, in this task, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they serve as mental facts about the individual's state of mind, rather than the external truth or untrue nature of the situation being referred to. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not necessarily entail that Person B indeed holds that belief. However, it's important to remember that entailment can still occur within the scope of Person A's beliefs. Your objective is to dismantle these 'mental facts' and examine whether they directly lead to the hypothesis. Draw your conclusions based not on the structural similarity between sentences but on the logical proof presented. Record your choice from the options provided, with your response structured as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

<START> Your task is to accurately identify the logical relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, paying close attention to the subtleties of personal beliefs and their relation to assumptions. Specifically, you'll be looking for 'entailment' - situations where the hypothesis is assuredly true based on what's stated in the premise or 'non-entailment' where the hypothesis doesn't necessarily follow the premise. Keep in mind the important difference between one person's assumption about another person's belief and the confirmed truth of that person’s belief. In this task, beliefs, even if they are assumptions, are viewed as 'mental facts' about an individual's mind-set, rather than the given situation’s actual truth or falsehood. If the premise includes one person's belief about another's, it does not automatically mean the second person also holds that belief. However, entailment can still be found within the thoughts of the first person. Evaluate these 'mental facts' to see if they unquestionably lead to the hypothesis. Base your conclusions not on similar sentence structures, but on the logical evidence provided. Moreover, socio-cultural contexts and generally accepted roles or positions can be considered when inferring entailment. Record your choice from the given options, outlining your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>. Be aware that your answer should be the result of careful dismantling of the mental facts and logical analysis, rather than a simple matching of sentences. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail assumes that Olivia thinks that lady wearing brown jacket with brown boots and orange colored scarf is hearing music while sitting in the train. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that lady wearing brown jacket with brown boots and orange colored scarf is hearing music while sitting in the train.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Abigail assumes that Olivia thinks that lady wearing brown jacket with brown boots and orange colored scarf is hearing music while sitting in the train. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that lady wearing brown jacket with brown boots and orange colored scarf is hearing music while sitting in the train. Options: (A) entailment, (B) non-entailment.

Model's Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Reason: The model appears to have misinterpreted the task, leading it to select the incorrect option of entailment. The model did not consider the distinction between Abigail's belief about Olivia's belief and Abigail's own belief, which are two different things. Just because Abigail thinks that Olivia believes something does not ensure that it's Abigail's belief as well. Considering the premise, there is not enough information to support that the belief Abigail assumes Olivia to have, is inherently Abigail's belief too, so the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'.

Prompt improvement:
1. More explicit differentiation instructions could be provided to reinforce the fact that a person's belief about another person's belief and a person's own belief are distinct. 

2. Adding examples to the prompt may guide the model to perform the task more accurately.

3. Specify that the task isn't about determining similarities or similarities in wording but about reasoning the underlying connections or lack thereof.

4. A simplified explanation of what entailment and non-entailment mean could add clarity. Along with an instruction to carefully consider whether the belief in the premise and the hypothesis are from the same person's perspective or not.

Summarized aspects for improvements:
1. Reinforce understanding of the distinction between a person's belief and another person's belief to the model.
2. Use explicit examples to direct the model.
3. Provide a more clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.
4. Clearly establish that structural similarity doesn't imply entailment.
5. Include the need to examine the perspective of the belief mentioned in the premise and hypothesis.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your task is to examine the premises and hypotheses given with attention to detail, while focusing specifically on the complex elements of personal beliefs and their associated assumptions. Your aim is to identify the logical linkages between these elements and using a sophisticated comprehension of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The term 'entailment' points to situations where the truth of a hypothesis is inherently validated by the premise itself. One significant point to note here is that the belief one person has about the belief of another person does not provide solid evidence that the second person genuinely espouses that belief. Throughout this task, regardless of whether the beliefs mentioned in the premise are assumptions, they act as mental facts about a person's mental state rather than indicating the true or false nature of the scenario they are describing. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not directly entail that Person B genuinely shares that belief. However, it is crucial to remember that entailment can still take place within the framework of Person A's own beliefs. The goal of your task is to deconstruct these 'mental facts' and evaluate whether or not they directly result in the hypothesis being correct. Your conclusions should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence provided. To do this effectively, note the following points: 

1. If the premise and hypothesis deal with different individuals' beliefs, they do not entail each other.

2. If the premise involves Person A's belief about Person B, it does not mean Person B holds the same belief.

3. The task requires an examination of logical (or illogical) connections and not mere structural similarities between sentences.

Choose your answer from the options given and format your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>. You should conclude based on your assessment of whether the premise and hypothesis 'entail' or 'non-entail' each other. An 'entailment' means the premise necessitates the hypothesis, whereas 'non-entailment' suggests the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. The evaluation should be thorough and devoid of assumptions. <END>

My current prompt is:
Thoroughly analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with care, most particularly focusing on the intricate constructs of personal beliefs and their connections to assumptions. Your challenge is to define the logical bonds between them while using a nuanced understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to conditions where the truth of the hypothesis is innately ensured by the premise. Take note of a crucial distinction: one person's belief about another person's belief is not the same as concrete evidence of that the second person holds that belief. Essentially, in this task, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they serve as mental facts about the individual's state of mind, rather than the external truth or untrue nature of the situation being referred to. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not necessarily entail that Person B indeed holds that belief. However, it's important to remember that entailment can still occur within the scope of Person A's beliefs. Your objective is to dismantle these 'mental facts' and examine whether they directly lead to the hypothesis. Draw your conclusions based not on the structural similarity between sentences but on the logical proof presented. Record your choice from the options provided, with your response structured as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess and identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, and denote your response in the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
(2) Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, placing emphasis on the nuanced role of personal beliefs and assumptions. Identify the logical relationships between them, focusing on the concept of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', taking into account the difference between someone's belief about another person's understanding and factual evidence of that person's understanding. Remember, 'entailment' means the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily guaranteed by the premise. If premises are based on personal beliefs or assumptions, verify whether these directly entail the facts in a hypothesis before making your decision. Your response should not be based solely on the similarity of the sentence structures but the evidence presented. Denote your choice among provided options using the format <answer>Option choice</answer>.
(3) Analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with precision, honing in on the intricate implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember, 'entailment' means the certainty of the hypothesis being true is inherently guaranteed by the premise. A key distinction to bear in mind is the difference between someone's belief about another person's belief and factual evidence of that person's belief. Essentially, in these tasks, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they are considered as facts about the state of mind of the individual and not the truth or falsity of the external situation they refer to. If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief. Examine if these 'mental facts' directly entail the hypothesis before making a determination. Your decision should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence presented. Indicate your choice among the options given, structuring your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. Just because adults and children share in looking at something and some young ladies stand to the side, it does not guarantee that some children are looking. It is possible that the children are not looking at that particular thing. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:

This question depicts a scene involving two boys, but their environment is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis introducing a new context (classroom setting) which was not mentioned or implied in the premise, making it a case of non-entailment - Thomas recognizing the boys does not necessarily imply that the boys are sitting in a classroom at their desks.

The issue here seems to be with the example and correct label rather than the model's prompt or output. The model's evaluation and choice of 'non-entailment' seems to be appropriate within the logical understanding of entailment.

Wrong example 2:

In this example, the premise mentions that adults and children are sharing the act of looking at something. The hypothesis then makes a particular statement focusing on the children's action of looking. Given the information in the premise, it logically follows that since children are included in the action, the specific statement that some children are looking is entailed.

The problem seems to be the model's overemphasis on 'assumptions' potentially leading to 'non-entailment'. The prompt suggests the model to doubt or question the certainty of statements involving 'assumptions,' which could lead the model to categorize this as non-entailment, even though the action of the children looking is specified in the premise.

Improvements based on the issues identified:

1. The language of the prompt might be leading to overemphasis on the uncertainty introduced by words like 'assumptions' and 'suspicions'. While it is true that these words introduce some degree of uncertainty, the instructions could stress more on the logical relationships and consistency of realities expressed. 

2. Provide clearer examples or model interactions that showcase how 'assumptions' can both negatively and positively impact the relationship between premises and hypotheses. 

3. The instructions could place more emphasis on the necessity for the contents of the hypothesis to be explicitly or implicitly included in the premise for entailment to be valid.

4. The instructions could be made clearer on what entails certainty or uncertainty in relationships between premises and hypotheses, perhaps by providing additional examples or further explanations. 

5. Ensure that the correct labels for the examples are accurate to avoid inconsistencies within the learning process. 

6. The prompt could be more direct about the need to consider the entirety of the premise and whether it provides enough information to confidently support the hypothesis, even when the premise includes elements of uncertainty.

Therefore, the hypothesis introducing a new context (classroom setting) which was not mentioned or implied in the premise, making it a case of non-entailment - Thomas recognizing the boys does not necessarily imply that the boys are sitting in a classroom at their desks.

The issue here seems to be with the example and correct label rather than the model's prompt or output. The model's evaluation and choice of 'non-entailment' seems to be appropriate within the logical understanding of entailment.

Wrong example 2:

In this example, the premise mentions that adults and children are sharing the act of looking at something. The hypothesis then makes a particular statement focusing on the children's action of looking. Given the information in the premise, it logically follows that since children are included in the action, the specific statement that some children are looking is entailed.

The problem seems to be the model's overemphasis on 'assumptions' potentially leading to 'non-entailment'. The prompt suggests the model to doubt or question the certainty of statements involving 'assumptions,' which could lead the model to categorize this as non-entailment, even though the action of the children looking is specified in the premise.

Improvements based on the issues identified:

1. The language of the prompt might be leading to overemphasis on the uncertainty introduced by words like 'assumptions' and 'suspicions'. While it is true that these words introduce some degree of uncertainty, the instructions could stress more on the logical relationships and consistency of realities expressed. 

2. Provide clearer examples or model interactions that showcase how 'assumptions' can both negatively and positively impact the relationship between premises and hypotheses. 

3. The instructions could place more emphasis on the necessity for the contents of the hypothesis to be explicitly or implicitly included in the premise for entailment to be valid.

4. The instructions could be made clearer on what entails certainty or uncertainty in relationships between premises and hypotheses, perhaps by providing additional examples or further explanations. 

5. Ensure that the correct labels for the examples are accurate to avoid inconsistencies within the learning process. 

6. The prompt could be more direct about the need to consider the entirety of the premise and whether it provides enough information to confidently support the hypothesis, even when the premise includes elements of uncertainty.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles suspects that Thomas learns that a young woman is about to descend the stairs into a metro station. Hypothesis: Charles suspects that a young woman is about to descend the stairs into a metro station.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment because Charles suspecting that Thomas knows something does not necessarily mean that Charles himself knows the same thing. Therefore, Charles suspecting that a young woman is about to descend the stairs into a metro station does not entail that a young woman is actually about to descend the stairs into a metro station. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is A.

Issues with the Prompt:
1. Complexity: The prompt is a bit complex and long, therefore making it possible that important details might get lost amidst a sea of instructions.
2. Unclear Usage of Entailment: The prompt might incorrectly lead the model to think that entailment requires the exact mirroring of the premise in the hypothesis, while in logical entailment, the hypothesis can be a subset of the premise.
3. Assumption and Suspicion Focus: The prompt's strong emphasis on assumptions and suspicions can lead the model to lean towards 'non-entailment' even when certain situations involve these factors but still entail the hypothesis.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Simplification: Strip down the prompt to its essential instructions to avoid information overload.
2. Clear Definition: Include a more explicit instruction around the concept of 'entailment', ensuring the model understands that it implies a logical connection, not an exact mirroring of hypothesis in the premise.
3. Balance Emphasis: Instead of focusing heavily on assumptions and suspicions, equal weight should be given to elements that may support entailment.

Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Unclear instructions: The prompt might not be making it clear to the AI that it is supposed to evaluate any direct or implicit logical implications of the premise on the hypothesis. In this particular instance, the act of a child eating chocolate cake with their fingers moderately suggests the possibility of the child having chocolate all over their hands.

2. Overemphasis on 'assumptions' and 'suspicions': The AI might be too biased towards the uncertainty accentuated with 'assumptions' or 'suspicions' while missing the inherent everyday logic that typically follows the normal course of events. The premise does not say explicitly how the child eats with their fingers; it is natural to deduce the possibility of chocolate covering his hands.

3. Consideration of 'entailment' in only certain terms: The AI might not be considering entailment in a probabilistic sense, as the presence of belief in the premise is confused with an assumption or suspicion, creating unnecessary uncertainty.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Detailed Explanation: The prompt can provide a detailed explanation of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', including examples of real-world or logical implicit situations.

2. Encourage Probabilistic Thinking: The prompt should emphasize the importance of thinking probabilistically, where entailment doesn't always have to be 'certain', but 'plausible' or 'likely'.

3. Clarity regarding 'Assumptions' and 'Suspicions': The prompt should clarify the approach to premises involving 'belief', they should not be outrightly treated as 'assumptions' or 'suspicions', instead, think about the information contained within them.

4. Encourage Common-sense Reasoning: The prompt should highlight the consideration of common-sense reasoning and everyday logic while determining whether the premise entails the hypothesis.

prompt: Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses. It is important not only to focus on the explicit entities involved but also to understand the subtleties and implicitly suggested concepts. 'Entailment' in this context doesn't need to be certain, but should be plausible based on everyday logic or common-sense reasoning. It can be quite likely that the premise logically implies the hypothesis. When 'assumptions' or 'suspicions' are part of the premise, these often indicate uncertainty, but they should not always be assumed to result in 'non-entailment'. This is especially true when 'belief' is used, which should not automatically be treated as an assumption. Bear in mind to assess each case individually and don't forget to use real-world implications to infer logical relationships. Indicate your assessment by selecting 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' from the options and place your chosen answer in brackets like this <answer>(Option choice)</answer>. An example answer might look like <answer>(A) entailment</answer> or <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Remember, the aim is to gauge the likelihood of the premise implying the hypothesis.

   prompt: In this task, your role is to analyze, scrutinize, and evaluate the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses. This necessitates a thorough investigation of not only explicit cause and effect correlations, but also of hidden entailments, possible implications, and underpinning assumptions. Keep in mind that the focus should be more on the actual content of the arguments rather than their syntactic composition. Take into consideration various levels of detail, starting from minor particulars to larger abstract ideas, and pinpoint all pertinent facts or overarching information contained within the context. Pay heed to the credibility, origin, and substance of the information, along with the knowledge status of the individuals referenced. Remember that a person’s assumption about another person’s comprehension typically signals that person's own understanding. It is important to realize that people's assumptions or beliefs about others' knowledge or memory may not invariably mirror the actual memory or knowledge of those individuals. Hence, treat assumptions as potentially reflective of the reality until discounted by valid contradictory information. Evaluate critically the sources of assumptions and the probability of misinformation, while remembering that an assumption doesn't necessarily lead to misinformation. Ascertain if the hypothesis logically stems from the premise by opting for either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Recall that different cognitive principles may apply and that the premise doesn't need to align perfectly in detail with the hypothesis. It is more vital to comprehend the intrinsic logical relationship. Exercise skepticism when evaluating implied information against what could merely be a product of fallacies rising from assumptions. Provide your decision on the link between the premise and hypothesis, along with your reasoning, and place it within parentheses between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: You have a task to scrutinize and assess intricate logical relationships between given premises and hypotheses; this encompasses a thorough investigation of not only direct cause-and-effect relationships but also indirect entailments, implications, and multi-level assumptions. Make fine-grained analogies and utilize abstract reasoning to unveil potential types of relationships between entities. Consider the credibility, source, and content of information, as well as the epistemic status of every individual in the sentences. Understand that individuals' beliefs or assumptions about others' knowledge or memory may not always align with the actual knowledge or memory held by those individuals. An assumption alone may not necessarily equate to other people's thoughts or memories, or even reality. Be exceptionally cautious of where the assumptions originate from and whether there is room for misinformation, especially when assumptions or suspicions are in play—do not treat these as proven facts. To determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, think critically about whether the connection is truly an 'entailment' or a 'non-entailment', including analysing the possibility of any cognitive model at play. Don't jump to conclusions based on the words' surface meaning alone - go deeper into logical interpretation. Check to see what would be logically consistent versus what could merely be the artefact of assumption-fault-fallacy. After taking all these factors into account, provide your selected response, ensuring to bracket it between <answer> and </answer>, and back up your choice with robust reasoning that considers all the above-mentioned points.

Focus not only on direct cause-effect relationships but also on indirect entailments, level of generalization or specificity, and nested assumptions. Also pay attention to whose point of view or assumption the argument is attributed to, as it can affect the logical connection. Recognize that the premise can sometimes logically imply the general theme of the hypothesis, even if not all specifics align exactly. Remember entailment is not necessarily bidirectional.

   prompt: Analyze the qualitative relationships and potential workspace scenarios considered within the premises and hypotheses. These relationships could include direct cause-effect relationships, indirect entailments, attrition variables, level of generality or specificity, nested contingencies, and implied assumptions. Also, be particularly mindful of shifts in perspectives, such as changes in belief or suspicion about another's knowledge or awareness. These shifts can significantly affect the logical relationship and understanding that a belief about a belief doesn't necessarily translate into factual knowledge or an entailment. Remember, entailment is not always a two-way street. When making your assessment, consider whether the hypothesis logically builds upon the premise. Label it as 'entailment' if the premise meets the criteria for the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if it does not. When providing your answer, respect the potential intricacy these elements may introduce by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>. Always keep in mind, the task could be more complex than it initially appears.

   prompt: Analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with precision, honing in on the intricate implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Your task is to examine the premises and hypotheses given with attention to detail, while focusing specifically on the complex elements of personal beliefs and their associated assumptions. Your aim is to identify the logical linkages between these elements and using a sophisticated comprehension of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The term 'entailment' points to situations where the truth of a hypothesis is inherently validated by the premise itself. One significant point to note here is that the belief one person has about the belief of another person does not provide solid evidence that the second person genuinely espouses that belief. Throughout this task, regardless of whether the beliefs mentioned in the premise are assumptions, they act as mental facts about a person's mental state rather than indicating the true or false nature of the scenario they are describing. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not directly entail that Person B genuinely shares that belief. However, it is crucial to remember that entailment can still take place within the framework of Person A's own beliefs. The goal of your task is to deconstruct these 'mental facts' and evaluate whether or not they directly result in the hypothesis being correct. Your conclusions should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence provided. To do this effectively, note the following points: 

1. If the premise and hypothesis deal with different individuals' beliefs, they do not entail each other.

2. If the premise involves Person A's belief about Person B, it does not mean Person B holds the same belief.

3. The task requires an examination of logical (or illogical) connections and not mere structural similarities between sentences.

Choose your answer from the options given and format your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>. You should conclude based on your assessment of whether the premise and hypothesis 'entail' or 'non-entail' each other. An 'entailment' means the premise necessitates the hypothesis, whereas 'non-entailment' suggests the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. The evaluation should be thorough and devoid of assumptions.

   prompt: Analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with precision, honing in on the intricate implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember, 'entailment' means the certainty of the hypothesis being true is inherently guaranteed by the premise. A key distinction to bear in mind is the difference between someone's belief about another person's belief and factual evidence of that person's belief. Essentially, in these tasks, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they are considered as facts about the state of mind of the individual and not the truth or falsity of the external situation they refer to. If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief. Examine if these 'mental facts' directly entail the hypothesis before making a determination. Your decision should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence presented. Indicate your choice among the options given, structuring your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

   prompt: Your challenge is to critically analyze and ascertain the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, focusing on fine details related to personal beliefs and assumptions. Concentrate on understanding 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in depth. 'Entailment' is when the premise inherently guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this task, keep in mind that you're interpreting beliefs stated in the premise not as truth or falsity of what they speak of, but as statements about people's mental states. If a premise involves someone's belief about someone of third party's McLlegit (for instance, Tom believes Sarah thinks X), understand that it doesn't automatically mean the third person (Sarah in this case) indeed has that belief. In simpler terms, you are tasked to recognize the consistency of the suspicions and assumptions of the original thinker (Tom) in the premise when comparing with the hypothesis. Do not solely rely on the complex or simple nature of sentence structures but rather on the essence of the belief or suspicion conveyed by the author of the premise. Your final decision should be firmly based on logical evidence. Present your answer in the form <answer>Option choice</answer>. In order to master this task, consider the focus on the consistency of the narrator's belief, given that reducing the complexity of relational dependencies to simpler ones does not necessarily alter the 'entailment'.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, primarily focusing on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Pay keen attention to the implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Importantly, make a clear distinction between the belief one person holds about another person's view, and the actual understanding or belief of the latter. Remember, 'entailment' implies that the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily guaranteed by the premise. If premises contain personal beliefs or assumptions, ascertain whether these beliefs or assumptions directly guarantee the facts in a hypothesis. Your decision should be based on the evidence presented and not just the similarity of sentence structures. Provide your choice among the options given, indicating your answer using the format <answer>Option choice</answer>. When inspecting beliefs about others' understanding, remember that one individual's perspective does not inherently reflect the belief or understanding of the other person. Consequently, a claim about what one person believes about another person's understanding does not necessarily entail the actual belief of the latter. Analyze accordingly and render your verdict.

   prompt: You have a task to scrutinize and assess intricate logical relationships between given premises and hypotheses; this encompasses a thorough investigation of not only direct cause-and-effect relationships but also indirect entailments, implications, and multi-level assumptions. Make fine-grained analogies and utilize abstract reasoning to unveil potential types of relationships between entities. Consider the credibility, source, and content of information, as well as the epistemic status of every individual in the sentences. Understand that individuals' beliefs or assumptions about others' knowledge or memory may not always align with the actual knowledge or memory held by those individuals. An assumption alone may not necessarily equate to other people's thoughts or memories, or even reality. Be exceptionally cautious of where the assumptions originate from and whether there is room for misinformation, especially when assumptions or suspicions are in play—do not treat these as proven facts. To determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, think critically about whether the connection is truly an 'entailment' or a 'non-entailment', including analysing the possibility of any cognitive model at play. Don't jump to conclusions based on the words' surface meaning alone - go deeper into logical interpretation. Check to see what would be logically consistent versus what could merely be the artefact of assumption-fault-fallacy.

   prompt: The task requires you to analyze, explore, and assess the logical relationships between presented premises and hypotheses. This involves a detailed examination, not only of explicit cause-effect links, but also implicit entailments, potential implications, and underlying assumptions. Take into account different levels of specificity, from microscopic details to abstract concepts, and identify the core facts or general information embedded within the context. Pay attention to the credibility, source, and content of the information, as well as the epistemic status of individuals mentioned. Note that a person’s assumption about another person’s understanding usually implies that person's own understanding. Keep in mind that what people assume or believe about others' knowledge or memory does not always align with the actual knowledge or memory of those individuals. Do take into account that an assumption may not necessarily portray the actual thoughts or memories of others or define reality. Be critical in evaluating the origin of the assumptions and the likelihood of misinformation. Assess if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, there might be different levels of cognitive principles involved and not every detail in the premise has to perfectly match with the hypothesis. What's more important is to judge the underlying logical relationship. Be critical when analyzing implied information versus what could just be a result of assumption-born-fallacy.

   prompt: Your task is to critically analyze and evaluate the logical relationships between a given premise and hypothesis. This involves not just direct cause-and-effect relationships, but also understanding indirect entailments, implications, and any assumptions that may be nested within the premise and hypothesis. Use abstract reasoning and micro-analogies to identify potential relationships between the entities described in the sentences. Attention should be paid to the credibility, source, and content of the presented information, playing close attention to the differing epistemic statuses of the individuals within the sentences. Be aware of the distinction between the depicted assumptions or beliefs about another's knowledge or memory, and what is actually observed or stated about that individual's knowledge or memory. Be aware that an assumption may not necessarily correspond to reality or the thoughts or memories of others. Carefully consider the source of the assumptions and look for potential areas of misinformation. Determine whether the hypothesis logically follows the premise by choosing either 'entailment' if the hypothesis is a direct or indirect result of the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis does not logically follow. Your analysis should be comprehensive, taking into account any possible cognitive models, and distinguishing what is logically implied from what may simply be an assumption or fallacy. Be precise and cautious in your approach. When providing your answer, it must be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>, and be sure to provide reasoning for your choice. After analyzing the information and rationale presented in the premise, answer this question: Does the hypothesis logically follow from the premise? Please choose from 'entailment' if it does, or 'non-entailment' if it does not, and explain your reasoning.

   prompt: Your task is to critically analyze and determine the logical relationships between given premises and hypotheses. This involves a thorough examination of not only explicit cause-effect links, but also implicit entailments and potential implications. When evaluating the relationship, pay attention to tangible facts and general information embedded within the sentences, striking a balance between microscopic details and overarching concepts. Evaluate the credibility, source, and content of the information, as well as the perceived knowledge level of individuals mentioned. Remember, an individual’s assumption about another person’s understanding does not guarantee that the latter person possesses said understanding. Keep this distinction in mind when processing the content of sentences. An assumption does not necessarily reflect truth or fact and should be scrutinized critically for potential errors or misinterpretations. While considering the origin of assumptions, be alert to the presence and impact of misinformation. The task is not a matching game between the premise and the hypothesis, so not every detail in the premise needs to align perfectly with the hypothesis. More importantly, based on the premise, is the hypothesis a logical outcome? This decision of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' involves deep comprehension of the context and the underlying implicit information it provides. Pay heed to whether an assertion is an implied fact or merely a fallacious assumption. Provide your decision on the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis with reasoning, enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.

Take into consideration various levels of detail, starting from minor particulars to larger abstract ideas, and pinpoint all pertinent facts or overarching information contained within the context. Pay heed to the credibility, origin, and substance of the information, along with the knowledge status of the individuals referenced. Remember that a person’s assumption about another person’s comprehension typically signals that person's own understanding. It is important to realize that people's assumptions or beliefs about others' knowledge or memory may not invariably mirror the actual memory or knowledge of those individuals. Hence, treat assumptions as potentially reflective of the reality until discounted by valid contradictory information. Evaluate critically the sources of assumptions and the probability of misinformation, while remembering that an assumption doesn't necessarily lead to misinformation. Ascertain if the hypothesis logically stems from the premise by opting for either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Recall that different cognitive principles may apply and that the premise doesn't need to align perfectly in detail with the hypothesis. It is more vital to comprehend the intrinsic logical relationship. Exercise skepticism when evaluating implied information against what could merely be a product of fallacies rising from assumptions. Provide your decision on the link between the premise and hypothesis, along with your reasoning, and place it within parentheses between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: In this task, you are required to identify and evaluate not just the expressed cause-effect connections but also the subtle logical relationships between a presented premise and hypothesis. This calls for an in-depth investigation of explicit and implicit entailments, underlying assumptions, and potential implications. Discover the core facts or general information embedded at different levels of abstraction, from minute details to overarching concepts. Assess the credibility, origin, and content of information, as well as the epistemic positioning of the individuals mentioned. Notice that a person’s assumptions about another person’s understanding can often hint at that person's own understanding, but it does not necessarily confirm awareness or comprehension in the reverse direction. It's crucial to acknowledge that what people believe or predict about others' comprehension or memory might not entirely match with the actual knowledge or memory held by those individuals. Be mindful that an inference might not truly reflect the actual thoughts, beliefs, or recollections of others. Exercise caution and critical thinking when you apprehend the origins of assumptions, to evaluate the possibility of misconceptions or misinformation. Analyze if the hypothesis logically stems from the premise by choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Recall that there might be different cognitive processes at play and the presence or absence of certain details in the premise or hypothesis does not alone determine the entailment. Of paramount importance is to explore the core logical relationship, sometimes hidden underneath the surface details. Maintain a critical perspective while analyzing entailed information, as opposed to judgements purely resulting from assumption-induced misinterpretations. Validate your decisions on the relationship between the premise and hypothesis with clear reasoning. Any conclusions drawn should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, focusing not simply on the basic content of the statements, but also on the nuances introduced by different perspectives, implications, and embedded assumptions. Recognize that entailment is not solely about the agreement of details, but also about the consistency and alignment of assumptions and perspectives. Be aware that who is considered to understand, know, or perceive something may change the very meaning of the argument. Acknowledge that hypotheses and premises may have different levels of indeterminacies based on who the argument is attributed to. Evaluate if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by considering the entities, their roles, and their relationships within both premise and hypotheses. Choose 'entailment' if the premise completely and accurately underpins the hypothesis from the same perspective, and 'non-entailment' if the supporting elements in the premise do not sufficiently form a logical foundation for the hypothesis or if perspective differs. Ensure your answer is wrapped between <answer> and </answer>, considering the intricacies of the task.

   prompt: Analyze the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses, bearing in mind all plausible logical implications. Direct cause-effect relationships as well as indirect entailments should be scrutinized. Also take into account variations in the level of generalization or specificity, coupled with nested assumptions. Identify if there are modifications in the person's point of view or assumptions and assess whether they alter the veracity of the statements. Keep in mind that someone expressing a belief, thought, recognition, or memory does not make the statement inherently true. Understand that the premise may suggest the overall theme of the hypothesis without exactly matching every specific detail. Also bear in mind that a premise indirectly implying a hypothesis through entailed assumptions doesn't require it to state the same explicitly. And remember, an entailment from the premise to the hypothesis doesn't necessarily mean there's a reverse entailment. With this analysis, determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing either 'entailment' if the premise meets the conditions for the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if it does not.

   prompt: Analyze the qualitative relationships and potential workspace scenarios considered within the premises and hypotheses. These relationships could include direct cause-effect relationships, indirect entailments, attrition variables, level of generality or specificity, nested contingencies, and implied assumptions. Also, be particularly mindful of shifts in perspectives, such as changes in belief or suspicion about another's knowledge or awareness. These shifts can significantly affect the logical relationship and understanding that a belief about a belief doesn't necessarily translate into factual knowledge or an entailment. Remember, entailment is not always a two-way street. When making your assessment, consider whether the hypothesis logically builds upon the premise. Label it as 'entailment' if the premise meets the criteria for the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if it does not. When providing your answer, respect the potential intricacy these elements may introduce by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.

Your task is to identify the logical connections between them, requiring a deep understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember, 'entailment' means the certainty of the hypothesis being true is inherently guaranteed by the premise. A key distinction to bear in mind is the difference between someone's belief about another person's belief and factual evidence of that person's belief. Essentially, in these tasks, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they are considered as facts about the state of mind of the individual and not the truth or falsity of the external situation they refer to. If a premise includes someone's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT necessarily entail that the second person indeed holds that belief.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the logical relationships between provided premises and hypotheses, primarily focusing on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Pay keen attention to the implications of personal beliefs and assumptions. Importantly, make a clear distinction between the belief one person holds about another person's view, and the actual understanding or belief of the latter. Remember, 'entailment' implies that the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily guaranteed by the premise. If premises contain personal beliefs or assumptions, ascertain whether these beliefs or assumptions directly guarantee the facts in a hypothesis. Your decision should be based on the evidence presented and not just the similarity of sentence structures. Provide your choice among the options given, indicating your answer using the format <answer>Option choice</answer>. When inspecting beliefs about others' understanding, remember that one individual's perspective does not inherently reflect the belief or understanding of the other person. Consequently, a claim about what one person believes about another person's understanding does not necessarily entail the actual belief of the latter. Analyze accordingly and render your verdict.

   prompt: Consider the provided premises and hypotheses. Your task is to determine the logical relationship between them, focusing specifically on the concept of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' means that the truth of the hypothesis is guaranteed by the premise, even if they're not identical but logically related. Analyze how personal beliefs or assumptions in the premises might entail the facts in the hypotheses. Keep in mind, a person's belief about another's understanding may reflect their perception, but it doesn't necessarily constitute factual evidence of that person's understanding. Thus, align your decision-making process not solely based on the similarity of sentence structures but also on the actual content and logic between the statements.

   prompt: Your challenge is to critically analyze and ascertain the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, focusing on fine details related to personal beliefs and assumptions. Concentrate on understanding 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in depth. 'Entailment' is when the premise inherently guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. In this task, keep in mind that you're interpreting beliefs stated in the premise not as truth or falsity of what they speak of, but as statements about people's mental states. If a premise involves someone's belief about someone of third party's McLlegit (for instance, Tom believes Sarah thinks X), understand that it doesn't automatically mean the third person (Sarah in this case) indeed has that belief. In simpler terms, you are tasked to recognize the consistency of the suspicions and assumptions of the original thinker (Tom) in the premise when comparing with the hypothesis. Do not solely rely on the complex or simple nature of sentence structures but rather on the essence of the belief or suspicion conveyed by the author of the premise. Your final decision should be firmly based on logical evidence. Present your answer in the form <answer>Option choice</answer>. In order to master this task, consider the focus on the consistency of the narrator's belief, given that reducing the complexity of relational dependencies to simpler ones does not necessarily alter the 'entailment'.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the premises and hypotheses provided with care, most particularly focusing on the intricate constructs of personal beliefs and their connections to assumptions. Your challenge is to define the logical bonds between them while using a nuanced understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to conditions where the truth of the hypothesis is innately ensured by the premise. Take note of a crucial distinction: one person's belief about another person's belief is not the same as concrete evidence of that the second person holds that belief. Essentially, in this task, even if the beliefs stated in the premise are assumptions, they serve as mental facts about the individual's state of mind, rather than the external truth or untrue nature of the situation being referred to. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not necessarily entail that Person B indeed holds that belief. However, it's important to remember that entailment can still occur within the scope of Person A's beliefs. Your objective is to dismantle these 'mental facts' and examine whether they directly lead to the hypothesis. Draw your conclusions based not on the structural similarity between sentences but on the logical proof presented.

   prompt: Your task is to dissect the given premises and hypotheses, particularly focusing on the complex influences of personal beliefs and assumptions. You're required to uncover the logical connections between the premise and hypothesis, calling for a profound understanding of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Remember that 'entailment' implies that the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily ensured by the premise. In these tasks, regardless of whether the beliefs within the premise are presumptions, they are to be interpreted as factual representations of the individual's inner state of mind, not the objective truth or falsehood of the external situation to which they refer. When a premise refers to one person's belief about another person's belief, it does NOT always infer that the second person actually harbors that belief. Particularly, when third person's 'seeing' or 'observing' the belief is stated, it may entail that the second person does hold the belief. Critically examine if these 'mental facts' assure the hypothesis before making a conclusion. Your conclusion should not merely rely on structural similarity of sentences, but on the logical inference it offers. Indicate your choice amongst the options provided, framing your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to accurately identify the logical relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, paying close attention to the subtleties of personal beliefs and their relation to assumptions. Specifically, you'll be looking for 'entailment' - situations where the hypothesis is assuredly true based on what's stated in the premise or 'non-entailment' where the hypothesis doesn't necessarily follow the premise. Keep in mind the important difference between one person's assumption about another person's belief and the confirmed truth of that person’s belief. In this task, beliefs, even if they are assumptions, are viewed as 'mental facts' about an individual's mind-set, rather than the given situation’s actual truth or falsehood. If the premise includes one person's belief about another's, it does not automatically mean the second person also holds that belief. However, entailment can still be found within the thoughts of the first person. Evaluate these 'mental facts' to see if they unquestionably lead to the hypothesis. Base your conclusions not on similar sentence structures, but on the logical evidence provided. Moreover, socio-cultural contexts and generally accepted roles or positions can be considered when inferring entailment. Record your choice from the given options, outlining your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>. Be aware that your answer should be the result of careful dismantling of the mental facts and logical analysis, rather than a simple matching of sentences.

   prompt: Your task is to examine the premises and hypotheses given with attention to detail, while focusing specifically on the complex elements of personal beliefs and their associated assumptions. Your aim is to identify the logical linkages between these elements and using a sophisticated comprehension of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The term 'entailment' points to situations where the truth of a hypothesis is inherently validated by the premise itself. One significant point to note here is that the belief one person has about the belief of another person does not provide solid evidence that the second person genuinely espouses that belief. Throughout this task, regardless of whether the beliefs mentioned in the premise are assumptions, they act as mental facts about a person's mental state rather than indicating the true or false nature of the scenario they are describing. In cases where the premise includes Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it does not directly entail that Person B genuinely shares that belief. However, it is crucial to remember that entailment can still take place within the framework of Person A's own beliefs. The goal of your task is to deconstruct these 'mental facts' and evaluate whether or not they directly result in the hypothesis being correct. Your conclusions should be based not on the structural similarity of the sentences but on the logical evidence provided. To do this effectively, note the following points: 

1. If the premise and hypothesis deal with different individuals' beliefs, they do not entail each other.

2. If the premise involves Person A's belief about Person B, it does not mean Person B holds the same belief.

3. The task requires an examination of logical (or illogical) connections and not mere structural similarities between sentences.

Choose your answer from the options given and format your response as <answer>Option choice</answer>. You should conclude based on your assessment of whether the premise and hypothesis 'entail' or 'non-entail' each other. An 'entailment' means the premise necessitates the hypothesis, whereas 'non-entailment' suggests the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis. The evaluation should be thorough and devoid of assumptions.

   prompt: Examine the given premises and hypotheses, particularly paying attention to the interplay between personal beliefs and assumptions. Your mission is to identify if entailment or non-entailment exists between them. 'Entailment' here signifies a situation where the truthfulness of the hypothesis is guaranteed by the premise. Bear in mind that an individual's belief about someone else's belief does not necessarily correspond to the actual belief of that second person. In this exercise, beliefs expressed in the premises, even if they are guesses, represent mental realities about the thinker's mindset, rather than the truthful or untruthful nature of the external situation alluded to. Remember, when a premise presents Person A's belief about Person B's belief, it doesn't automatically mean that Person B actually has that belief. Though, take note that entailment can occur within the boundaries of Person A's beliefs. Analyze these 'mental realities' and determine if they directly entail the hypothesis. Your conclusion should not rely on sentence structure similarity, but on the logical evidence provided.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses. It is important not only to focus on the explicit entities involved but also to understand the subtleties and implicitly suggested concepts. 'Entailment' in this context doesn't need to be certain, but should be plausible based on everyday logic or common-sense reasoning. It can be quite likely that the premise logically implies the hypothesis. When 'assumptions' or 'suspicions' are part of the premise, these often indicate uncertainty, but they should not always be assumed to result in 'non-entailment'. This is especially true when 'belief' is used, which should not automatically be treated as an assumption. Bear in mind to assess each case individually and don't forget to use real-world implications to infer logical relationships. Indicate your assessment by selecting 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' from the options and place your chosen answer in brackets like this <answer>(Option choice)</answer>. An example answer might look like <answer>(A) entailment</answer> or <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>. Remember, the aim is to gauge the likelihood of the premise implying the hypothesis.
