I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old: Louis and Bernard. 

<answer>(B) 2</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:

(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3. <answer>(C)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The model does not take into consideration the information that the penguin named Bernard was removed from the table. This is why it still counts Bernard as a penguin that's less than 8 years old. The prompt doesn't emphasize the importance of the operations (like add or delete) performed on the data which is leading to incorrect understanding.

Wrong Example 2:
Similar to the first example, the model does not recognize the operation of deletion of the penguin Bernard. It incorrectly counts Bernard as a penguin who is more than 8 years old, leading to an incorrect response.

Wrong Example 3:
In this situation, the model correctly identifies that it should focus on the giraffe table, but it incorrectly counts Jody in the tally of giraffes older than 5 years, even though Jody is exactly 5 years old and not more than that.
 
All errors seem to revolve around the model not adequately processing changes in the data (like removals), and not properly understanding the distinctions in age requirements (more than vs. equal to). 

Improvements on the Prompt:

1. Emphasize on any operational changes: Ensure that the AI model considers any additions, deletions or other operational changes made to the original data. The prompt can be modified to reflect the importance of these operations.

2. Clear requirement distinction: Make sure the model understands the nuances of the conditions in the questions. For instance, differentiate between ‘more than’ or ‘at least’ or 'equal to'.

3. Questions section: Make the questions section stand out or distinctly separate from the rest of the prompt so that the model can focus on it.

4. Instructions Clarification: Add additional instructions to ensure that the AI model understands the need to consider the most updated data.

Here's a suggestion to improve the current prompt: 
"Consider the given data about penguins or giraffes. Note that the data may change with new additions or deletions. Your task is to answer the following questions considering the final updated data. Make sure to pay close attention to specific query conditions (like age). All answers should be based on the latest table information, reflecting all changes carried out. Answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:

The question is “How many penguins are less than 8 years old?”. The model responded with an incorrect answer: "(B)2". According to the model's response, it appears that the model failed to note that the penguin named Bernard had been removed from the list before the question was asked. As a result, it incorrectly included Bernard, who indeed is less than 8 years old, but does not exist in the table at the time the question is asked. 

Wrong example 2: 

The question is “How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?”. The model responded with an incorrect answer: "(C)3". From the model's response, it’s clear that the model incorrectly counted Jody, who is exactly 5 years old, not more than 5. 

Reasons for incorrect answers and prompt improvement:

1. Understanding of temporal information: Current explanation in the prompt does not specify the model to handle and account for temporal changes in data. It is vital for the model to track changes in context and adjust its inferences accordingly.

2. Precise numerical comparison: The model is not accurately interpreting the comparison operators in the questions. For example, in the second wrong example, 'more than' does not include the value being compared to, and this nuance needs to be picked up by the model.

Prompt Improvement:

Improve explicit command details, emphasize understanding of temporal changes and careful numerical comparison, and provide examples that show this behavior. For example, the revised prompt may be:

"Answer questions about data provided, accounting for any changes specified in the context. You should carefully interpret comparison operators in questions to provide accurate answers. For example, 'less than 8 years old' does not include 8-year-old, 'more than 5 years old' does not include 5-year-old, and 'exactly 5 years old' means only 5 years old. Make sure to adjust your considerations if certain elements are added or removed from the data during the exercise. Finally, always bracket the answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end."

By making these adjustments, we can guide the model to pay attention to more subtle details and requirements of the task, leading to more accurate results.

The question requires the model to answer "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?", but the current prompt doesn't guide the model to process the data from the table and compute the result. We can see 'causal attribution' is irrelevant here, making the model fail to correlate ages and counting penguins. The prompt doesn't encourage the model to perform elementary mathematical operations, like counting.

<2>

In this situation, the question to answer is "What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?". Once again, the current prompt doesn't steer the model to perform the required operation, which in this case is sorting names alphabetically and choosing the last one. The term 'causal attribution' doesn't apply to this problem, so the model is getting confused about what action to take. 

Overall, the current prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" seems to be inapplicable and vague for the tasks given, as the tasks don't involve finding cause-effect relationships or explaining why things occurred.

To improve the prompt: 

1) Specify the type of the task: The prompts can be made more specific to the kind of operation the model needs to perform, like counting items based on a condition or sorting items in a specific manner.

2) Make the prompt more explicit: Provide clear instructions within the prompt about what the AI is supposed to consider and what it is supposed to ignore.

3) Provide more context: If the tasks are to be performed on tables, include this information in the prompts. 

A better prompt might be : 
"Process the provided table information, follow the stated rules and answer the multiple-choice questions about the data". 

This way, the AI knows exactly what to do: Process table data, follow a set of rules, and answer questions about it.

Wrong Example Analysis:

For the wrong example provided, the main issue seems to be with the model's understanding and interpretation of the data, not with the prompt itself. The model has scanned the data tables accurately and has calculated the number of animals more than 5 years old correctly as well. It provides a detailed step-by-step analysis of how it arrived at its conclusion, demonstrating that it understands the task outlined in the prompt. The confusion arises in the conclusion made based on the choices provided. 

It seems there is an error in the correct label rather than the model's response. The model correctly identifies that there are 6 animals over the age of 5 (3 penguins and 3 giraffes), which corresponds to choice (B) in the options provided. However, the correct label is marked as (A) 5 - which seems to be a mistake. 

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:

1. Clarify the task: The current prompt is quite broad and could lead to a variety of interpretations. Break down the tasks into smaller steps that indicate the model should first understand and interpret the data, then execute the necessary mathematical operations, and finally choose the right option from the multiple-choice options.

2. Give more context: More context could be added to the prompt to increase understanding. Specify what kind of operations need to be carried out on the data (e.g., "execute mathematical calculations" or "classify data based on specific criteria").

3. Explain technical terminologies: Make sure that any technical terminologies, abbreviations, and assumptions in the prompt are thoroughly explained.

4. Ensure correct labelling of answers: Before passing the data to the model, ensure that the correct labels are accurately marked. This will aid the model in learning the correct response to the prompts. 

5. Include examples: Including examples to guide the AI's understanding can be crucial in ensuring it performs as expected.

Remember, the quality of the training data and correct labelling is as important as the quality of the prompt for generating correct results.

The model's response is: 
To find the average height of the penguins, we first need to calculate the total height of all the penguins and then divide by the number of penguins.

Total height = 50 + 80 + 60 + 70 + 90 = 350 cm
Number of penguins = 5 (original penguins) + 1 (James) = 6

Average height = Total height / Number of penguins
Average height = 350 / 6
Average height = 58.33 cm

Therefore, the average height of the penguins is 58.33 cm, which is closest to option (A) 60.

Example Issue <1>: 

The issue here arises from the model's miscalculation in the "total height" of the penguins. Instead of adding up the individual heights of all five penguins (50 + 80 + 60 + 70 + 90 = 350 cm), the model should have obtained a total height of 450 cm. Dividing this total height by the total number of penguins (including James, the newly added penguin) would have given the accurate average height, which is 75 cm (answer choice D), instead of 58.33 cm as calculated by the model. 

This error seems to be a computation mistake rather than an issue with the initial prompt. So, the mistake is not due to misinterpretation of the prompt but incorrect mathematical calculations. 

However, it's worth noting that the prompt could be misleading as it requires the model to both add a new penguin to the list and compute the average. This two-step process might be confusing for the model leading it to make errors in calculation.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Error checking: To prevent the model from offering incorrect mathematical solutions, ensure that it has rigorous error-checking methods or similar mechanisms in place for result verification. 

2. Simplify tasks: Separating the tasks into simpler, individual commands may reduce errors. For example, the model could first be asked to update the table with the new addition and then calculate the average.

3. Clear instructions for a multi-step task: It would be helpful if the instructions specifically asked the model to complete each task one by one. For example, "After adding James to the table, now calculate the average height of all penguins."

4. Reinforce comprehension: The prompt could specify that the model must understand the contextual input and perform the necessary operation. For instance, "Understand the data from the table, complete all required operations accurately, and then answer the multiple-choice question."

5. Define the format for the answer: The prompt can be more specific about the desired output format, which should not only include the final answer but also the logic or calculations that led to that answer.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to analyze the data in the table:

Louis: Age 7, Weight 11 kg
Bernard: Age 5, Weight 13 kg
Vincent: Age 9, Weight 11 kg
Gwen: Age 8, Weight 15 kg
James: Age 12, Weight 12 kg

After adding James and deleting Bernard, we have the following penguins:
Louis: Age 7, Weight 11 kg
Vincent: Age 9, Weight 11 kg
Gwen: Age 8, Weight 15 kg
James: Age 12, Weight 12 kg

Now, we need to find the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg:
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg, so she meets the criteria.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg, so he meets the criteria.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?

In this example, the model incorrectly identifies the penguin James as meeting the criteria. While James is older than 5 years, his weight is exactly 12 kg, not over 12 kg as the question specifies. 

The model's confusion arises from the ambiguity in the prompt. The phrase "weight more than 12 kg" can be interpreted as "weight 12 kg or more." A more precise prompt would clarify whether "more than" includes the stated number.

The model's response demonstrates an understanding of analyzing and removing data from the table (i.e., the penguin Bernard). However, it shows a slight misunderstanding of the comparison operator "more than," leading to an overestimation.

<2> 

Question: How many penguins are more than 8 years old?

In this case, the model incorrectly identifies the penguin Gwen as meeting the criteria. While Gwen is indeed 8 years old, the question asks for penguins who are more than 8 years old. 

Like in the previous example, the error arises from the model's misinterpretation of the phrase "more than." The model seems to perceive it as "equal to or more than," leading to the inclusion of Gwen in the count and thus an overestimation.

The model correctly analyzes the data by deleting the penguin Bernard from scrutiny as per the instruction. However, the comparison operator error persists as in the previous case.

Based on these analyses, the potential improvements to the prompts are:

1) Clarifying the comparison operator: The model seems to perceive "more than" as "equal to or more than," causing errors in the responses. Specifying clearly what the operator means can help alleviate these errors. 

2) Emphasizing distinction between "more than" and "equal to or more than": The prompts should make clear distinctions between the two phrases, as the model seems to treat them as identical. This clarification can help in cases where only entries above but not equal to a certain value should be counted.

3) Encouraging the model to double-check the accuracy of its solutions: Given that the model correctly executed elements of the prompt (e.g., removing Bernard), the incorrect answers seem to result from overestimations during counting. Creating a prompt to encourage the model to verify its results against the original data or to be more attentive to details could potentially mitigate these errors.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and interpret the data table, execute required operations, and answer the multiple-choice questions accurately.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze and interpret the data table, execute required operations, and answer the multiple-choice questions accurately.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to analyze the data in the table:

Louis: Age 7, Weight 11 kg
Bernard: Age 5, Weight 13 kg
Vincent: Age 9, Weight 11 kg
Gwen: Age 8, Weight 15 kg
James: Age 12, Weight 12 kg

After adding James and deleting Bernard, we have the following penguins:
Louis: Age 7, Weight 11 kg
Vincent: Age 9, Weight 11 kg
Gwen: Age 8, Weight 15 kg
James: Age 12, Weight 12 kg

Now, we need to find the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg:
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, so he doesn't meet the criteria.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg, so she meets the criteria.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg, so he meets the criteria.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

The answer is: <answer>(B) 2</answer>

gradient:
For example 1, the logic model uses in the processing is incorrect. The model is asked to determine the number of giraffes older than 5 years of age. The model provided an error by counting the giraffe, Jody, who is exactly 5 years old. This issue arises because the question's language itself -- "more than 5 years old" -- isn't interpreted correctly. The model erroneously counted animals that are 5 years old, not just those older than 5. 

For example 2, there is an improper consideration of data alteration. The model didn't take into account the data deletion operation specified in the text. The model was supposed to delete the data row of Bernard, which would've altered the number of penguins under the age of 8. Thus, its interpretation of the phrase "delete the penguin named Bernard from the table" in the context is incorrect.

Both of these problems emerge from the model's suboptimal understanding of comparative language (i.e. "more than") and data manipulation instructions. 

Considering these factors, the prompt could be improved in the following ways:

1. Make it explicit that the model should consider every word in the question, with special attention paid to comparative language indicating age, height, weight, etc. These should be meticulously processed for accurate information interpretation.

2. Emphasize the importance of data manipulation tasks such as "adding" or "deleting" rows. Ensure the model understands that these operations can alter the amount of data which needs to be evaluated.

3. Specify that the context of the question and data provided is essential for accurate calculations, and that all parts of the text given should have a significant bearing on the logic applied. 

4. Highlight that the model should verify its logic one more time before finalizing the answer. This might help with weeding out possible misconceptions arising from complex phrases or operations within the task.

5. Ask the model to ensure correct interpretation and implementation of multiple-choice answers, emphasizing that the options need to correspond with the analysis conducted on the data.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to sort the giraffes' names in alphabetical order and then select the last one.

The giraffes' names in alphabetical order are:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question:
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Given Model's Response: 
Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.
Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

Correct Label: C
Model's prediction: D

Reasons for wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of the question: The main flaw in the given model's response is its incorrect interpretation of the question. The model's interpretation of 'last' is related to the position in a sorted order while it's simply asking for the giraffe's name in the last position of the given data table.

2. Incomplete analysis: The model underwent an unnecessary step of sorting data in alphabetical order, instead of reading from the original table. The name of the last giraffe per the table is 'Donna', but following alphabetical order, the last one should be 'Marian'. 

3. Ignored information: The model didn't consider the option (E) 'Louise', which should be the 'last' name if sorted alphabetically. This is most likely due to the model's failure to acknowledge that the multiple-choice options might also contain valid data for the question.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Clarity of task: While the prompt is detailed and it specifies multiple steps, the 'interpret the data' request might need to indicate clearly that the data may not always need to be manipulated or reordered.

2. Understanding Question: It should be made clear in the prompt that the question must be understood fully in the most literal sense. In this instance, the term 'last' was misinterpreted, leading to an incorrect answer.

3. Integration of multiple-choice options: The prompt could also specify that multiple-choice options may contain a valid piece of data. The model may be directed to consider these choices also while answering questions.

4. Sullivan the data: A clarification can be added that not all data provided needs to be used. Some information might be a red herring. The model should be cautious in over-analyzing or misinterpreting the data and should focus on what directly contributes to the answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Updated Table:
name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

Calculations:
1. Penguins more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg:
- Vincent: Age = 9, Weight = 11 (Not meeting both criteria)
- Gwen: Age = 8, Weight = 15 (Meets both criteria)
- James: Age = 12, Weight = 12 (Meets both criteria)

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

The answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> For the first example, the reason the model gets the question incorrect is because it doesn't seem to properly interpret the and condition in the given multiple-choice question. When determining which penguins meet the criteria, the model counts the penguins that either meet the age condition (>5 years old), or the weight condition (>12 kg), rather than both conditions. As a result, the model incorrectly includes 'James' who doesn't meet the weight condition into the calculation.

Another potential problem is that the model doesn’t appear to accurately understand the “greater than” condition. While the model correctly identifies the age of James as greater than 5 and excludes Vincent due to his weight, it counts James’s weight as greater than 12 kg even though James’s weight is listed as exactly 12 kg and not more than that.

The prompt could be improved by making explicit that both conditions must be satisfied simultaneously. It should specify that the age must be greater than 5 years and the weight also must be greater than 12 kg (not equal to 12). Lastly, provide clear instructions to the model to interpret UI elements like tables to ensure it can thoroughly update, remove or add data entries. 

The final improved prompt could be: 

"Interpret the data in the table and update it with the new information provided in the prompt. In updating, ensure you can add, remove or modify the listed entries as required. Based on this updated data, perform the required calculations. Ensure that you clearly understand all conditions in the question and they are met simultaneously, not individually, before you include a data entry in your calculation. Allow for a detailed step-by-step definition of your working towards the final answer. After you've ensured your calculations are correct, answer the multiple-choice question accordingly. The output should include both the logic and the selected answer from the multiple-choice options. The answer must be concluded between <answer> and </answer> markers."

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Updating the penguin table with the new entry:
name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

Now, analyzing the giraffe table:
name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650

From the giraffe table, we can see that there are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old:
1. Jody, age 5
2. Gladys, age 10
3. Donna, age 9

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:
In this example, the model does not adhere to the instruction provided. It is asked to pay "special attention to comparative language (i.e., "more than", "less than")". However, it includes the giraffe with an age of 5 years (Jody) as being more than 5 years old. When the comparative language is properly interpreted, only two giraffes (Gladys and Donna) are more than 5 years old, giving the correct answer as (B) 2.

Thus, the model misunderstood the comparative language, leading to an incorrect answer.

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Clarity on Comparative Language: The prompt should more explicitly match the task, demanding clear comprehension of comparative language. It could emphasize that in the case of comparative language like "more than" or "less than", the values exactly equal to the reference number should not be included in the comparisons. 

2. Verification Strategy: The prompt could suggest a strategy of verification for each step of the process, urging the model to double-check its understanding, calculations, and analysis at each stage of the task.

Updated Prompt:
Analyze and interpret the data in the given table and the text. Be cautious with comparative language (like "more than", "less than"), understanding that "more than" doesn't include the exact value. Ensure proper implementation for instructions for data manipulation tasks like adding or deleting rows. Update the table with new information if specified and perform the required data manipulation tasks correctly. Use the updated table to carry out calculations meticulously, providing a comprehensive procedure leading to your final answer while double-checking assumptions or interpretations of the question at each step. Prior to choosing an answer from the multiple-choice options, verify the correctness of your calculations by revisiting your process. Your output should include your thought process, and your final answer enclosed between <answer> and </answer> brackets. Additionally, confirm that your selected answer corresponds with your conducted analysis.

gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1) The model's understanding of the problem seems flawed. The task was to find the last giraffe's name in sorted alphabetic order, but the response shows a misunderstanding of how to sort alphabetically. The last giraffe's name sorted in alphabetical order should be Marian, but the model reports it as Jody.

2) The model does not follow the instruction to re-evaluate its logic before finalizing the answer. A second look at the sorted list of giraffe names would have alerted the model that Jody cannot be the last name in an alphabetically sorted list.

3) The model has neglected the specific instruction to ensure that its chosen answer aligns with its analysis. The analysis states that the names, when arranged alphabetically, are: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian. However, it incorrectly selects Jody as the last name in alphabetical order, which contradicts its analysis.

In the example, computing and tabulation skills of the model seem adequate. However, interpreting directions and thinking logically seem to be where the errors lie.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1) Emphasize the importance of correctly interpreting the question/task: The model should fully understand the task before conducting any analysis. The terms used should be thoroughly understood and correctly interpreted.

2) Ability to perform self-evaluation and self-correction: The model should be able to detect its own mistakes through a self-evaluation process. In this case, the model should recognize that Jody is not the last name when the list is alphabetically sorted. 

3) Re-emphasize the importance of clear and correct logical reasoning: The final response should be logically sound and consistent with the analysis provided. In the example, the model's reasoning and the chosen answer were inconsistent. 

4) Specify the importance of alphabetical order understanding: As this example shows, a data analysis task may require understanding of alphabetical order. Instructions should be explicit about such operations and the model must accurately execute these tasks. 

5) Include instructions that ask the model to double-check its work: The model seemed to rush to a solution without fully considering its results. Ensuring a final review is performed could help avoid such mistakes.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Updated Table:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

Calculations:
1. Penguins more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg:
- Vincent: Age 9, Weight 11 kg (Not meeting both criteria)
- Gwen: Age 8, Weight 15 kg (Meets both criteria)
- James: Age 12, Weight 12 kg (Meets both criteria)

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

<answer>(B) 2</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1 Reasoning:

In this example, the language model made an error in correctly interpreting and applying the conditions given in the question. The conditions given were that the penguins have to be more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. However, in the model's response and calculation, one of the penguins listed (James) only meets one of the criteria - he is more than 5 years old but weighs exactly 12 kg, not more than 12 kg. As a result, only one penguin - Gwen - meets the criteria, but the model incorrectly concludes that two penguins meet the criteria.

Reasons For Wrong Answer:

1. Interpretation Error: The model overlooked the term "more than" while computing weights of the penguins, which caused it to include penguins who weighed exactly 12 kg rather than "more than" 12 kg.
2. Lack of Double-checking: The prompt only asks the model to reevaluate its logic before answering the multiple-choice question. However, the model should also have a step where it double-checks the application of conditions/criteria mentioned to ensure strict adherence.
3. Unclear Instructions: The prompt might not be clear enough for the model to realize that all conditions must strictly be met; for instance, that "more than 12 kg" excludes 12 kg.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. The prompt should explicitly mention that all conditions or instructions given in the text should be meticulously applied and or adhered to.
2. The prompt should include a statement asking the model to double-check or reevaluate not only its logic in calculations but also how it is applying the conditions or criteria stated in the question.
3. The prompt should also specify how to treat equal-to conditions. For instance, if "more than" should strictly exclude the exact value.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column of the table.

Before adding James and deleting Bernard, there are 4 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8

After adding James, there are 5 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8
- James, age 12

Now, we delete Bernard from the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8
- James, age 12

Therefore, there are 2 penguins less than 8 years old, which are Louis and Gwen.

The answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question: Interpret the data in the given table according to the requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed... Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin, with name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)... For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm... How many penguins are less than 8 years old?

Wrong Answer: To find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column of the table... Now, we delete Bernard from the table: - Louis, age 7 - Vincent, age 9 - Gwen, age 8 - James, age 12... Therefore, there are 2 penguins less than 8 years old, which are Louis and Gwen... The answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

Reason for the mistake: The age of Gwen is 8 and should not be classified as less than 8 years old. The model fails to correctly interpret the age restrictions imposed by the question. This has led it to inaccurately count the number of penguins aged less than 8.

The prompt's instructions are lengthy and potentially distracting, particularly the caution against using unnecessary data and information manipulation, which may divert from the key task of correctly reading and applying the table data.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Instead of using general directives, make the prompt more specific to tasks involving tasks with tables, emphasizing a close reading of the table data.
2. Clearly instruct the model to strictly adhere to the conditions or constraints stipulated by the question.
3. Reiterate the importance of accuracy when interpreting numeric parameters or constraints.
4. Instruct the model to verify its answers with the multiple-choice options, as a correct answer should always correspond with one of the answer choices.

Interpret the data in the given table according to the requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed. All aspects of the task, including multiple-choice options, should be considered as they may contain relevant data. Provide a detailed explanation for your interpretation and calculations leading to the final answer, while paying careful attention to the direct requirements of the question. Make sure to ensure the correctness of your calculations before answering the multiple-choice question accurately. The output should consist of each individual step's logic and the selected answer from the multiple-choice options. The final answer must be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. Be cautious with data that doesn't directly contribute to the answer. It's not always necessary to use all information provided.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Interpret the data in the given table according to the requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed. All aspects of the task, including multiple-choice options, should be considered as they may contain relevant data. Provide a detailed explanation for your interpretation and calculations leading to the final answer, while paying careful attention to the direct requirements of the question.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column of the table.

Before adding James and deleting Bernard, there are 4 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8

After adding James, there are 5 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8
- James, age 12

Now, we delete Bernard from the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8
- James, age 12

Therefore, there are 2 penguins less than 8 years old, which are Louis and Gwen.

The answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: Interpret the data in the given table according to the requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed... Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin, with name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)... For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm... How many penguins are less than 8 years old?

Wrong Answer: To find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column of the table... Now, we delete Bernard from the table: - Louis, age 7 - Vincent, age 9 - Gwen, age 8 - James, age 12... Therefore, there are 2 penguins less than 8 years old, which are Louis and Gwen... The answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

Reason for the mistake: The age of Gwen is 8 and should not be classified as less than 8 years old. The model fails to correctly interpret the age restrictions imposed by the question. This has led it to inaccurately count the number of penguins aged less than 8.

The prompt's instructions are lengthy and potentially distracting, particularly the caution against using unnecessary data and information manipulation, which may divert from the key task of correctly reading and applying the table data.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Instead of using general directives, make the prompt more specific to tasks involving tasks with tables, emphasizing a close reading of the table data.
2. Clearly instruct the model to strictly adhere to the conditions or constraints stipulated by the question.
3. Reiterate the importance of accuracy when interpreting numeric parameters or constraints.
4. Instruct the model to verify its answers with the multiple-choice options, as a correct answer should always correspond with one of the answer choices.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and interpret the data table, execute required operations, and answer the multiple-choice questions accurately.
(2) Interpret the data in the table and update it with new information provided as needed. Then, use this updated data to perform the necessary calculations. Provide a detailed step-by-step explanation for your calculations leading to the final answer. After you've ensured your calculations are correct, answer the multiple-choice question accurately. The output should include both the logic and the selected answer from the multiple-choice options. The answer must be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers.
(3) Interpret the data in the given table according to the requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically.

The names in the giraffe table are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna.

Sorting these names alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Wrong Answer Step: Sorting these names alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.
Model's Prediction: (D) Donna
Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Reason for Wrong Answer:
The model made a mistake in sorting the names alphabetically. It appears the model sorted the names in ascending order (from A to Z), but the question requires sorting the names in descending order (from Z to A) since it asks for the last name in alphabetical order.

Aspects to Improve:
1. The prompt could explicitly emphasize the need to understand and follow the specific requirements of the question more clearly, including sorting order.
2. The prompt should clarify that understanding the question's language and condition is crucial and focus on that.
3. The prompt should indicate that the model should check its understanding of the language and conditions of the question when it gets them wrong.

Example 2:
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Incorrect Step: The model calculated Donna as the last giraffe in alphabetical order.
Model's prediction: (D) Donna
Correct answer: (C) Marian

Reason for Wrong Answer:
The model misunderstood the question and incorrectly sorted the names in ascending alphabetical order, leading to the wrong prediction.

Aspects to Improve:
1. The prompt should emphasize the understanding of the specific wording and requirements of each question.
2. It should instruct the model to check if the question asks for the first or last in a sequence, highest or lowest in a score, etc. to ensure that the sorting or other mathematical operations are carried out correctly.

Overall improvement of the prompt based on the above reasons:
1. The model should ensure the comprehension of the specific language and requirements of each question—this includes terminologies, mathematical operations, or logic.
2. The model should pay close attention to words that dictate the order or direction of calculations, e.g., ascending, descending, first, last, highest, lowest etc.
3. The model should verify its understanding and interpretation of the question especially when the answer is incorrect. 
4. The model should be reminded that not all provided data may be relevant, and it needs to carefully select and focus on the necessary information for each unique question.
5. Lastly, the trial and elimination method should be utilized, especially when dealing with multiple-choice options and the model's prediction is persistently incorrect.

Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find out how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column of the table.

Before adding James and deleting Bernard, there are 4 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8

After adding James, there are 5 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8
- James, age 12

Now, we delete Bernard from the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8
- James, age 12

Out of the remaining penguins, only Louis and Gwen are less than 8 years old. Therefore, the answer is 2 penguins less than 8 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The model made a mistake in interpreting the age data. While asking about penguins that are less than 8 years old, the model included Gwen who is 8 years old. The model was supposed to only include penguins whose age is below 8, but the language in the prompt isn't clear about the treatment of data that equals the specified value when it asks to identify data that's "less" than a certain amount. This could have led the model to interpret that it should include data that equals 8.

Reasons for incorrect answer:
1. The prompt lacks clarity regarding the handling of data that matches the condition value.
2. The model misinterpreted the word "less" to include the value "8".

The prompt can be improved by:
1. Including clear instructions about how to treat data that equals the given condition value.
2. Giving explicit instructions about the interpretation of comparative terms like "less than", "equal to" or "more than".

Improvements to the prompt:
Interpret and evaluate the data in the given table according to the exact requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed. Pay careful attention to comparative terms such as "less than", "equal to" or "more than", and clearly state how to treat data that equals the condition value. All aspects of the task, including multiple-choice options, should be referenced as they may contain important data for your interpretation. Provide a detailed and step-by-step explanation for your interpretation and calculations leading to your final answer. Make sure to check your calculations to ensure their correctness before selecting the answer from the multiple-choice options. The final answer must be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. Be wary of including data that doesn't contribute to the answer or isn't required by the question. Know that it's not always necessary to use all the information provided.

(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in both tables.

In the penguin table, we have Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). Out of these, Louis, Vincent, and Gwen are more than 5 years old.

In the giraffe table, we have Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), Marian (2 years old), and Donna (9 years old). Out of these, Gladys, Donna, and Jody are more than 5 years old.

Adding up the number of animals more than 5 years old from both tables, we have a total of 6 animals.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

The question "How many animals are more than 5 years old?" requires the model to only count animals whose age is strictly greater than 5, but the model misinterpreted the phrase "more than 5 years old" and included animals that are precisely 5 years old in its count. This leads to an incorrect total number of animals, and thus, an incorrect multiple-choice option.

Analysis:

1.  Incorrect Interpretation: The model failed to correctly interpret the question's requirement of "more than 5 years old." It included the penguin Bernard and the giraffe Jody, both aged exactly 5, into its count which it should not have.

2.  Mistaken Logic Assumption: It seems the model assumed "more than" to include the exact number in the consideration. It became a binary issue: animals either 'less than or equal' or 'greater than or equal,' rather than being a 'strictly greater than' situation as asked.

Reasons for Error:

It seems the model did not precisely comprehend the concept of 'more than' in the setting of counting ages. Therefore, it ended up overestimating the number of animals.

Suggestions for Prompt Improvement:

1.  Add instructions stating the model should strictly interpret terms associated with quantities like "more than," "less than," to exclude the exact number from selection.

2.  Ask the model to pay special attention to the specific age mentioned, as it can change the answer's nature (e.g., including or excluding animals exactly 5 years old can lead to different answers).

3.  In the case of doing calculations or applying logic, instruct the model to validate by confirming the accuracy of the understanding before finalizing.

4.  Encourage the model to tease out nuances in language especially linked to condition and definition like moderate, exclusively, below, last, etc., which can significantly change the interpretation of the question.

5.  Ensure the model isn't making assumptions based on common phrasing, such as assuming 'more than' would include the exact number in this prompt's context.

response:
<START> Analyze the data given in the tables and understand the specific requirements of the question. Don't add unnecessary complexity to the data unless explicitly called for. Be meticulous about all aspects of the task, like multiple-choice options, since they might contain needed cues. Give a detailed rationale for your data interpretation, estimated calculations, and how they led to the final answer. Be particularly cautious about key terms, like more than, less than, first, last, highest, lowest, etc., that depict calculation direction, sequence or condition. These terms need to be interpreted exactly, not loosely, as an inch of discrepancy can completely alter the answer's nature. Authenticate your calculations' accuracy before moving to the answer. Present your output in the storytelling format, mapping logical sequence of the steps taken, and pick the correct option from the multiple-choice answers. Place the final answer between <answer> and </answer> markers. If the data provided overshoots the need for the answer, prioritize crucial information over complete usage of the data. If prior predictions turned out wrong, use the elimination method to recheck the correct multiple-choice option. Understand the subtleties of the language set within the questions, and verify your understanding, most importantly if prior interpretations led to an error. Accurate interpretation of the question, keeping granular details in perspective and precise calculations are your keys to getting the right answer. Don't make assumptions; the task is to unveil the clear facts. <END>

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically.

The names of the giraffes are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna.

Sorting them alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Reason:
The error in this prediction arises from the model's incorrect interpretation of the term 'last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order'. The model sorted the names in alphabetical order and selected the last name in this order (Donna) which correlates with the incorrect option (D). However, the question asks for the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, which is actually Marian, falling under the correct option (C).

Improvements:
1. The term 'last' in the question can be misleading as it can be interpreted in multiple ways. To prevent confusion, it should be replaced with 'final' or 'end' to ensure that the model sorts the names in alphabetic order and selects the name at the end of this order. 

2. The model could also benefit from additional prompts emphasizing the importance of careful consideration when dealing with sorting or ordering tasks, especially in cases where the instructions use terms like 'first', 'last', 'highest', etc.

3. The model should also underscore the keyword 'alphabetic order', and stress on the point that in an alphabetical list, the last position is occupied by the word which would appear last in a dictionary, not the last word in an alphabetical sorting by the model.

4. Instructions could be modified to emphasize that the order in which the data is provided does not necessarily correspond to the correct order required to answer the question.

5. The prompt could be tweaked to encourage the model to verify its understanding of the task especially when it involves order and sorting. This could be done by asking the model to rephrase the key question before answering to confirm its understanding. 

6. In regards to multiple-choice answers, the model could be guided to carefully inspect each option and match it with the derived answer before making a final choice as it might have incorrectly matched the answer with the wrong choice. This instruction should be explicitly highlighted in the prompt to reduce chances of similar errors. 

Summary:

- Clearer definition of ordering terms (like 'last', 'final', 'end', 'top', 'bottom')
- Emphasis on the understanding and interpretation of key tasks like sorting and ordering
- Guiding the model to match the derived answer with the multiple-choice options accurately
- Instructions for rephrasing of the question to confirm the understanding of the task
- Stating explicitly to sort in 'alphabetic order'.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically.

The names of the giraffes are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna.

Sorting them alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Reason:
The error in this prediction arises from the model's incorrect interpretation of the term 'last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order'. The model sorted the names in alphabetical order and selected the last name in this order (Donna) which correlates with the incorrect option (D). However, the question asks for the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, which is actually Marian, falling under the correct option (C).

Improvements:
1. The term 'last' in the question can be misleading as it can be interpreted in multiple ways. To prevent confusion, it should be replaced with 'final' or 'end' to ensure that the model sorts the names in alphabetic order and selects the name at the end of this order. 

2. The model could also benefit from additional prompts emphasizing the importance of careful consideration when dealing with sorting or ordering tasks, especially in cases where the instructions use terms like 'first', 'last', 'highest', etc.

3. The model should also underscore the keyword 'alphabetic order', and stress on the point that in an alphabetical list, the last position is occupied by the word which would appear last in a dictionary, not the last word in an alphabetical sorting by the model.

4. Instructions could be modified to emphasize that the order in which the data is provided does not necessarily correspond to the correct order required to answer the question.

(3) Interpret the data in the given table according to the requirements of the question, without unnecessary manipulation of the information unless specifically instructed. All aspects of the task, including multiple-choice options, should be considered as they may contain relevant data. Provide a detailed explanation for your interpretation and calculations leading to the final answer, while paying careful attention to the direct requirements of the question. Make sure to ensure the correctness of your calculations before answering the multiple-choice question accurately. The output should consist of each individual step's logic and the selected answer from the multiple-choice options. The final answer must be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. Be cautious with data that doesn't directly contribute to the answer. It's not always necessary to use all information provided.
(4) Scrutinize the data provided in the table and comprehend the requirements of the question. Align your interpretation with the specifics asked in the question, without superfluous manipulation of the data unless clearly instructed. Be discerning of the task's elements, including the multiple-choice options as they may hold needed information.

Present your output as a logical narrative of the steps taken and select the correct option from the multiple-choice answers. Enclose the final answer in <answer> and </answer> markers. When the data exceeds the requirement for deriving an answer, prioritize what's exclusively necessary instead of using all the provided information. Use the elimination method to cross-verify the correct multiple-choice option remarkably when preceding predictions have been incorrect. Tease out the nuance in the language and terms used in the questions and verify your understanding, particularly when your previous interpretation resulted in errors. Correct understanding of the question and accurate calculations are key to nailing the right answer.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze the data in both provided and updated tables and understand the requisites of the question. Your interpretation should coincide with the specific query in the question, without unnecessary modification of the information unless directed. Pay close attention to all parts of the task, including the multiple-choice options, as they can contain useful data. Complete understanding of the task, especially when it involves sorting or ordering, is quintessential. When keywords defining order or direction like 'ascending', 'descending', 'first', 'last', 'highest', 'lowest' etc., are used, take time to verify your understanding, particularly if your past interpretations have resulted in errors. In a task requiring sorting in 'alphabetic order', remember that the last position is occupied by the word which would be last in a dictionary, not by the last entry in your sorting. Provide a thorough description explaining your interpretation and calculations resulting in the final answer. Validate the accuracy of your calculations before answering. Link your answer logistically with the steps taken and carefully match your derived response with the multiple-choice options. Your selected multiple-choice answer should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. If the data provided exceeds what you need to derive an answer, prioritize the necessary information explicitly. Use the elimination method to substantiate the correctness of your option, notably when earlier predictions have been incorrect. Finally, understanding of the question, accurate calculations and careful inspection of multiple-choice options is paramount in securing the right answer. <END>

When keywords defining order or direction like 'ascending', 'descending', 'first', 'last', 'highest', 'lowest' etc., are used, take time to verify your understanding, particularly if your past interpretations have resulted in errors. In a task requiring sorting in 'alphabetic order', remember that the last position is occupied by the word which would be last in a dictionary, not by the last entry in your sorting. Provide a thorough description explaining your interpretation and calculations resulting in the final answer. Validate the accuracy of your calculations before answering. Link your answer logistically with the steps taken and carefully match your derived response with the multiple-choice options. Your selected multiple-choice answer should be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. If the data provided exceeds what you need to derive an answer, prioritize the necessary information explicitly. Use the elimination method to substantiate the correctness of your option, notably when earlier predictions have been incorrect. Finally, understanding of the question, accurate calculations and careful inspection of multiple-choice options is paramount in securing the right answer.
cur_prompt: Scrutinize the data provided in the table and comprehend the requirements of the question. Align your interpretation with the specifics asked in the question, without superfluous manipulation of the data unless clearly instructed. Be discerning of the task's elements, including the multiple-choice options as they may hold needed information. Provide a comprehensive breakdown explaining your interpretation and calculations yielding to the final answer. Pay meticulous attention to key words defining the order, direction, or condition related to calculations or logic, like ascending, descending, first, last, highest, lowest etc. Confirm the correctness of your calculations prior to answering. Present your output as a logical narrative of the steps taken and select the correct option from the multiple-choice answers. Enclose the final answer in <answer> and </answer> markers. When the data exceeds the requirement for deriving an answer, prioritize what's exclusively necessary instead of using all the provided information. Use the elimination method to cross-verify the correct multiple-choice option remarkably when preceding predictions have been incorrect. Tease out the nuance in the language and terms used in the questions and verify your understanding, particularly when your previous interpretation resulted in errors. Correct understanding of the question and accurate calculations are key to nailing the right answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column of the table.

Before adding James and deleting Bernard, there were 4 penguins in the table. Out of these, Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.

After adding James and deleting Bernard, we have the following penguins:
- Louis, 7 years old
- Vincent, 9 years old
- Gwen, 8 years old
- James, 12 years old

Therefore, there are 2 penguins less than 8 years old, which are Louis and Bernard.

The correct answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model made incorrect calculations. Despite the prompt emphasizing scrutinizing the data provided and confirming the correctness of calculations prior to answering, the model still failed to execute it correctly.

The errors are as follows:

1. Misidentification of Relevant Data: The model correctly noticed the operation that has been performed on the data after the initial introduction i.e., the addition of James and deletion of Bernard. However, it failed to apply this information while determining the penguins of age less than 8 years old. It considered Bernard, who, based on the information in the question, no longer exists in the table.

2. Incorrect Calculation: The prompt mentioned to 'prioritize what's exclusively necessary instead of using all the provided information.' The model, however, didn't properly distinguish between necessary and nonessential data. In the context of this question, the penguins less than 8 years old were exclusively necessary, which only involves just one penguin: Louis.

Steps To Improve The Prompt:

1. Explicit Instruction: More emphasis should be placed on the instructions about considering changes and updates to the data set. In this case, deletion and addition of new data.

2. Emphasize Accurate Interpretation: The instructions should stress understanding the context of the data and question more accurately. In this case, understanding that Bernard's data should not be included in the computation as it has been deleted from the table.

3. Improved Calculation Methods: The prompt needs to better guide the model on refining its calculation methods for accurate output. It should reconfirm the relevant data used in calculations to be sure of its relevance in the context of the question at hand.

4. Encourage Self-checking: The prompt could encourage the model to self-check its interpretations and calculations. This cross verification process may help to avoid errors, as in the case of including Bernard in the count.

5. Question-Specific Evaluation: The prompt could include instructions to consider keywords in the question that indicate the specific nature of calculation or inference needed.  This could aid in making a more accurate interpretation of what the question specifically asks for. For example, focusing on 'less than 8 years old' to ensure the correct age group is being considered.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:

(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically.

The names in the giraffe table are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna.

Sorting these names alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question analysis: The question asks explicitly for the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall. It clearly states that the desired information can be retrieved from the table provided earlier.

Error in the answer: The model wrongly identifies Vincent as the penguin that is 70cm tall, however, by looking at the table, we are able to understand that Gwen is the penguin of the desired height.

Reason for the error: This error might be due to a misinterpretation of the data table by the model, where it got confused by the numeric data. Even though the data table is direct and straightforward, the model possibly failed to correctly match the height to the correct penguin.

<2> 
Question analysis: The question asks for the name of the last giraffe when names are sorted by alphabetic order.

Error in the answer: The model incorrectly identifies Donna as the last name when in fact, Marian falls last when sorted in alphabetical order.

Reason for the error: This error was caused by the incorrect calculation of the alphabetical order by the model. This seems to be due to an error in sorting the names alphabetically from the model's side.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Encourage the model to double-check data interpretation: The instruction could specifically ask the model to cross-verify its interpretation of the structured data. This aspect will make the model more critical about the information it extracts from the table.

2. Mention the importance of thorough verification of computation results: This would ensure the model doesn't make computation errors when it's required to perform tasks such as sorting or ordering data.

3. The instructions could emphasize a more careful analysis when dealing with multiple source data like multiple tables in the given examples. 

4. The prompt can clarify more on how to match the correct multiple-choice answers with the final result, encouraging the model to reaffirm its selected choice with the calculated final answer.

5. Include instructions specifying that the model should ensure the logical consistency of data interpretation and decision making, which may help prevent errors. 

Overall, in the prompt, focusing more on verification, precision, and thorough sequential explanation can be helpful for improving the accurate resolution of the questions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Vincent is the penguin that is 70 cm tall. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
As per the example, the error seems to stem from the model's misunderstanding of the data rather than an intrinsic problem with the prompt. The prompt provides clear instructions for data interpretation, comparison, and calculations. However, the model returns the wrong answer because it mismatches the penguin's name with its height.

Reasons for wrong answers based on the example:

1. Misinterpretation of data: Despite the clear instructions presented in the prompt, the language model misinterprets the data from the table, associating the 70cm height with the wrong penguin, Vincent, instead of the correct penguin, Gwen.

2. False assumptions: The model may have made assumptions about the order of the information, wrongly correlating the third penguin listed (Vincent) with the third mentioned height (70cm).

3. Neglecting the manipulative instructions: The prompt cautions against manipulation of the data but, the model might have misplaced order or interchanged data points.

Based on these reasons, here are suggestions to improve the prompt, though the error occurred due to data misinterpretation by the AI model rather than a flawed prompt:

1. More explicit instructions: Encourage the model to thoroughly verify all data attributes before reaching a conclusion. For instance, an additional line could be: "Always cross-check every data point's attributes in the context of the question before reaching a conclusion."

2. Sequence-focused instructions: Stress more on maintaining and understanding the sequence in which data is presented in the table. For example, add: "Ensure to respect the sequence in which the data points are presented and be careful not to confuse data between different lines."

3. Error prevention hints: Add instructions for the model to avoid common errors, such as confusing data points, misinterpreting headers with actual data, or assuming an incorrect order of data.

4. Encourage extra attention to detail: Ask the model to pay careful attention to the shared information and be detailed when making correlations. 

However, it is also crucial to remember that this single example does not necessarily mean the initial prompt is faulty. Other examples might show accurate data interpretation and correct response using the same prompt. The language model might need additional training to better understand data-centric tasks.

Any manipulation of information should be accurate and relevant, and should be done only when specifically instructed. Be precise when dealing with comparative values like "less than", "equal to", or "more than", and remember that a value equal to the condition set doesn't count as "less than". All elements of the task, including the multiple-choice alternatives, may contain useful data, and should be carefully evaluated. Provide a thorough, sequential explanation for your interpretation and computations that lead you toward the final answer. Ensure the accuracy of your calculations before selecting the precise answer from the multiple-choice options. The output must feature both the logical reasoning behind each step and the final quest choice answer. Your answer must be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. Avoid including irrelevant data in your answer. Use all the provided information conscientiously; it isn't always necessary to incorporate every piece of data in your answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the penguin that is 70 cm tall?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Vincent is the penguin that is 70 cm tall. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
As per the example, the error seems to stem from the model's misunderstanding of the data rather than an intrinsic problem with the prompt. The prompt provides clear instructions for data interpretation, comparison, and calculations. However, the model returns the wrong answer because it mismatches the penguin's name with its height.

Reasons for wrong answers based on the example:

1. Misinterpretation of data: Despite the clear instructions presented in the prompt, the language model misinterprets the data from the table, associating the 70cm height with the wrong penguin, Vincent, instead of the correct penguin, Gwen.

2. False assumptions: The model may have made assumptions about the order of the information, wrongly correlating the third penguin listed (Vincent) with the third mentioned height (70cm).

3. Neglecting the manipulative instructions: The prompt cautions against manipulation of the data but, the model might have misplaced order or interchanged data points.

Based on these reasons, here are suggestions to improve the prompt, though the error occurred due to data misinterpretation by the AI model rather than a flawed prompt:

1. More explicit instructions: Encourage the model to thoroughly verify all data attributes before reaching a conclusion. For instance, an additional line could be: "Always cross-check every data point's attributes in the context of the question before reaching a conclusion."

2. Sequence-focused instructions: Stress more on maintaining and understanding the sequence in which data is presented in the table. For example, add: "Ensure to respect the sequence in which the data points are presented and be careful not to confuse data between different lines."

3. Error prevention hints: Add instructions for the model to avoid common errors, such as confusing data points, misinterpreting headers with actual data, or assuming an incorrect order of data.

4. Encourage extra attention to detail: Ask the model to pay careful attention to the shared information and be detailed when making correlations. 

However, it is also crucial to remember that this single example does not necessarily mean the initial prompt is faulty. Other examples might show accurate data interpretation and correct response using the same prompt. The language model might need additional training to better understand data-centric tasks.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The first wrong example:

In this example, the AI misunderstood or overlooked the sort direction. The instruction "sorted by alphabetic order" requires the model to arrange the names in the alphabetic order, not in reverse order. The last name in alphabetical order would be Marian, not Donna. Thus, the model's error is likely due to a misunderstanding or oversight of the prompt's exact requirement of "alphabetic order," assuming it to be from Z to A instead of A to Z.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of sort direction: The model did not interpret correctly the phrase "sorted by alphabetical order". It seems to have sorted in decreasing order from Z to A rather than the correct increasing order, from A to Z.

The prompt may be improved:

1. Clarification on sorting direction: To avoid misinterpretation, the prompt can be more explicit about the sorting direction. For instance, "sorted by alphabetic order (A to Z)" can be a more precise way to express the requirement.

2. Emphasis on reading comprehension: Further stressing on the importance of reading comprehension can help improve the model's performance.

3. Reframing the question: If possible, questions could be reframed to limit the scope for misinterpretation—for example, "What is the last giraffe's name when sorted by alphabetic order (from A to Z)?"

Overall, the improvement in prompt requires more clarity in instructions and emphasizing on details for accurate response. The model should learn reading comprehension, attention to detail, and execute careful interpretation to perform the task accurately.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to consider the age and weight conditions simultaneously for each penguin.

After adding James and deleting Bernard, the updated table is as follows:
name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

Now, we need to find the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

From the updated table:
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, so he does not meet both conditions.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg, so she meets both conditions.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg, so he meets both conditions.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the given wrong example, the mistakes can be summarized as follows:

1. Misunderstanding the 'greater than' condition: The prompt specifically mentioned being careful with comparisons involving 'greater than' or 'less than' conditions. Despite this, the model includes penguins who meet the exact 'greater than' threshold (James, who weighs 12 kg) instead of enforcing a strict 'greater than' condition where values must be more than the mentioned threshold. This leads to the wrong answer as the model counts an extra penguin who should have been excluded from the count according to the conditions.

2. Inaccurate age assessment: The prompt indicates that all conditions must be met simultaneously. In this example, however, the model failed to accurately evaluate the age condition, including a penguin (Louis) who is not 'more than' 5 years old but precisely 7 years old.

3. Over-complication of the logic: The model seems to over-complicate the simple task of counting penguins that meet two conditions. While the prompt asks to carefully examine the data, it may lead the model to an unwanted level of details, resulting in confusion and unnecessary computations.

Based on these observations, the following points can be considered to improve the prompt:

1. Specify 'strictly greater than' and 'strictly less than': To avoid the misunderstanding of the comparison conditions, you could be more explicit and specify 'strictly greater than' or 'strictly less than' to highlight that the thresholds themselves are not included.

2. Emphasize equivalent evaluation of conditions: The prompt must stress understanding and applying all conditions equally and simultaneously. In this case, age and weight should both be regarded as mandatory predicates.

3. Simplify the requirement: Instead of guiding the model into comprehensive step-by-step computation, you can gear it towards simpler approaches such as direct counts for listing and comparison type tasks like this one.

4. Strict requirement for correctness check: The model should maintain a strict check for correctness and validation before wrapping up with the final answer. This could ensure catching any logical or condition application mistakes done during the process.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to consider the age and weight conditions simultaneously for each penguin.

After adding James and deleting Bernard, the updated table is as follows:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

Now, we need to find the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

From the updated table:
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, so he does not meet both conditions.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg, so she meets both conditions.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg, so he meets both conditions.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg? Options: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
Wrong Answer: (B) 2
Correct Answer: (A) 1

Reason:
The model made a mistake by including penguin ‘James’ in the count. In the given question, the conditions are ‘age more than 5’ and ‘weight more than 12’. However, while 'James' is indeed older than 5, he weighs exactly 12, not 'more than 12'. 

Aspect Leading to Wrong Answer:
The prompt advises the model to pay special attention to cases involving 'greater than' and 'less than' conditions, and ensure not to include values equal to the threshold. However, in practice, the model fails to follow this advice and includes 'James' in the count.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. It needs to emphasize more strongly on the mathematical conditions in such tasks, especially when handling conditions involving strict inequalities like 'greater than' or 'less than'. 
2. Include a specific reminder about values equal to the threshold and how they should be not included unless otherwise stated. For example, for the 'more than' condition, values equal to the number in the condition should not be counted.
3. Mention that a correct interpretation of these conditions is crucial for the accurate calculation and conclusion. 
4. Provide specific examples within the prompt to supplement the instruction about not including equal values in 'greater than' or 'less than' conditions. 

Suggested changes in the prompt could be:
"Be explicitly cautious while dealing with conditions involving 'more than' or 'less than'. Remember, 'more than 5' does not include 5. It is strictly numbers greater than 5. Similarly, 'less than 5' does not include 5. It is strictly numbers less than 5. Misinterpretation of these conditions may lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions. In all cases, unless explicitly stated, do not include values that are equal to the condition threshold in your calculation."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully examine the data in the table and apply any modifications that might be needed based on the new information given in the question. Be sure to clearly understand all conditions presented in the question; they must be met simultaneously, not individually, for a piece of data to be included in your calculation. Carry out all required computations, providing a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown that leads to your final answer. Confirm that all your calculations are accurate before you move on to answer the multiple-choice question. Include both your logical reasoning and your chosen option from the multiple-choice question in your output. Make sure to write your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer> markers. Pay special attention to comparing variables where the comparison involves the ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ condition. In such cases, be careful not to include values that are equal to the condition threshold.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:

Be sure to clearly understand all conditions presented in the question; they must be met simultaneously, not individually, for a piece of data to be included in your calculation.

Pay special attention to comparing variables where the comparison involves the ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ condition. In such cases, be careful not to include values that are equal to the condition threshold.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to consider the age and weight conditions simultaneously for each penguin.

After adding James and deleting Bernard, the updated table is as follows:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

Now, we need to find the penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

From the updated table:
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg, so he does not meet both conditions.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg, so she meets both conditions.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg, so he meets both conditions.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg? Options: (A) 1 (B) 2 (C) 3 (D) 4 (E) 5
Wrong Answer: (B) 2
Correct Answer: (A) 1

Reason:
The model made a mistake by including penguin ‘James’ in the count. In the given question, the conditions are ‘age more than 5’ and ‘weight more than 12’. However, while 'James' is indeed older than 5, he weighs exactly 12, not 'more than 12'. 

Aspect Leading to Wrong Answer:
The prompt advises the model to pay special attention to cases involving 'greater than' and 'less than' conditions, and ensure not to include values equal to the threshold. However, in practice, the model fails to follow this advice and includes 'James' in the count.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. It needs to emphasize more strongly on the mathematical conditions in such tasks, especially when handling conditions involving strict inequalities like 'greater than' or 'less than'. 
2. Include a specific reminder about values equal to the threshold and how they should be not included unless otherwise stated. For example, for the 'more than' condition, values equal to the number in the condition should not be counted.
3. Mention that a correct interpretation of these conditions is crucial for the accurate calculation and conclusion. 
4. Provide specific examples within the prompt to supplement the instruction about not including equal values in 'greater than' or 'less than' conditions. 

Suggested changes in the prompt could be:
"Be explicitly cautious while dealing with conditions involving 'more than' or 'less than'. Remember, 'more than 5' does not include 5. It is strictly numbers greater than 5. Similarly, 'less than 5' does not include 5. It is strictly numbers less than 5. Misinterpretation of these conditions may lead to incorrect calculations and conclusions. In all cases, unless explicitly stated, do not include values that are equal to the condition threshold in your calculation."

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and interpret the data table, execute required operations, and answer the multiple-choice questions accurately.
(2) Interpret the data in the table and update it with new information provided as needed. Then, use this updated data to perform the necessary calculations. Provide a detailed step-by-step explanation for your calculations leading to the final answer. After you've ensured your calculations are correct, answer the multiple-choice question accurately. The output should include both the logic and the selected answer from the multiple-choice options. The answer must be enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers.
(3) Carefully examine the data in the table and apply any modifications that might be needed based on the new information given in the question. Be sure to clearly understand all conditions presented in the question; they must be met simultaneously, not individually, for a piece of data to be included in your calculation. Carry out all required computations, providing a comprehensive step-by-step breakdown that leads to your final answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650

Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to sort the giraffes by name and then select the last one.

The giraffes listed in alphabetical order are:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Example 1:

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order? 

Model's Prediction: (D) Donna

In this example, the model made an error because it sorted the data alphabetically, and then incorrectly picked the "last" one alphabetically, Donna. However, the question is somewhat ambiguous. It may mean "last" in the alphabetical sense, in which case the answer would be "Marian". But it could also refer to the last one in the sorted array, as the model is assuming, in which case Donna would be correct. The phrasing of the question is thus open to interpretation. 

Reasons for incorrect response: 
- Ambiguity in question phrasing
- Misunderstanding of what "last" refers to 

Improvement:
The prompt could be improved by having the model ask for clarification when encountering ambiguous words like "last" in the question phrasing. Also, specifying that “last” in alphabetically sorted data usually implies the name starting with the last letter in the alphabet or, in this case, the highest name sorted alphabetically which is ‘Marian’.

Based on these issues:

- The model must be taught to understand word semantics better in the context of the task, such as the multiple meanings of "last".
- The prompt could encourage the model to seek clarification or make assumptions explicit when the question is ambiguous.
- Prompt can mention that "last" usually means the last name when names are sorted alphabetically.
- The given prompt could be improved by including a request for the model to consider potential ambiguity and to base its solutions on the most common interpretations used in data analysis. For example, in alphabetical sorting, "last" usually refers to the name closest to 'Z'.

Carefully examine the data in the table and make necessary adjustments based on new information provided in the question. Ensure to fully comprehend all conditions stated in the question. These conditions must be met collectively, not individually, to make a data point part of your computation. Perform all required calculations, providing a clear step-by-step reasoning leading to your final answer. Before advancing to answer the multiple-choice question, confirm each of your computations is correct. Your output should comprise both your logical thought process and your selected option from the multiple-choice question, enclosed between <answer> and </answer> markers. Pay close attention to comparisons where variables involve the ‘greater than’ or ‘less than’ condition and avoid including equality to the threshold in these instances. When the question is ambiguous or presents terminologies that can be interpreted in different ways, seek clarity by either providing most plausible interpretations or making assumptions explicit. For instance, in the case of alphabetical ordering, the term 'last' usually refers to the name closest to 'Z'.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are there in the tables?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 0 giraffes in the tables because the tables only contain penguins. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) 1</answer>

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

1. Misinterpretation of Data: The language model has misread or misinterpreted the data presented in the prompt. The prompt clearly states that there are two tables - one containing information about penguins, and another with details about giraffes. However, the model incorrectly assumes that all the data in the tables pertain to penguins only.

2. Incorrect Comprehension of Question: The question posed in the prompt specifically asks about the number of giraffes listed in the table. Despite this clear requirement, the language model instead develops a false premise that all the animals mentioned in the tables must be penguins. This leads to incorrect computation.

3. Incorrect Application of Question Review: The language model does not correct its false computation, even though it should, considering the instruction to make sure all computations are correct before answering the multiple-choice question. This proves that the model either overlooked or did not correctly interpret the prompt.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Emphasize Data Interpretation: The prompt should provide explicit instructions to the model about correctly interpreting the data on the basis of the provided question. This will ensure that the model comprehends the information correctly and does not develop false premises.

2. Question Understanding: Stress the importance of understanding the question correctly. What is being asked must be very clearly understood by the model, to correctly answer the question.

3. Underline Validation: Further underline the importance of reviewing and validating computations prior to answering. Ensure the model understands the serious need for reviewing computations and avoiding errors.

4. Multiple Data Sets: Explicitly mention how to handle situations where multiple data sets/types are present in the question, especially if they're separate from each other. 

5. Context awareness: The model needs to fully grasp context and nuances within the questions - that the term 'tables' encompasses both penguins and giraffes. There should be clarification on ambiguous terminologies or instructions.

6. Optional Clarification: The model should be willing to pose clarifying questions if something isn't clear, rather than making incorrect assumptions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg, we need to consider the following conditions:
1. Age > 5
2. Weight > 12 kg

After adding James and removing Bernard, the updated table is as follows:
name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

Now, we analyze each penguin:
- Louis: Age > 5, Weight < 12 (Does not meet both conditions)
- Vincent: Age > 5, Weight < 12 (Does not meet both conditions)
- Gwen: Age > 5, Weight > 12 (Meets both conditions)
- James: Age > 5, Weight > 12 (Meets both conditions)

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons with step-by-step examination:

Example 1:
In this question, the model correctly updates the table by adding James and removing Bernard, and identifies the conditions correctly (Age > 5, Weight > 12 kg). However, the model makes a mistake in assessing whether James meets the conditions. Although James is over 5 years old, he weighs just 12 kg, not more than 12 kg as the conditions require. The model incorrectly states that James "meets both conditions" and includes James in the final count. This leads to the selection of option B (2) instead of the correct option A (1). 

Based on these reasons, the aspects to improve the prompt could include:

1. Clearer Prompt: The language model should be more accurately directed to do each step of the process correctly. It should be explicitly told to consider the conditions collectively and avoid the inclusion of equality in the 'greater than' and 'less than' conditions, which was misunderstood in the case of James' weight by the model.

2. Emphasizing Accuracy: The prompt should emphasize the importance of accurate computation and the strict adherence to the conditions provided, especially in the case of mathematical operators.

3. Better Understanding of Terms: The prompt may need to clarify the interpretation of 'greater than', 'less than', and 'equal to', and provide explicit instructions that when a condition specifies 'greater than' or 'less than', it should not include 'equal to'.

4. Verification Step: The prompt can include a step for the model to verify its responses before finalizing them to reduce errors.

5. Use of Conditional Statements: The prompt should guide the language model to use conditional statements like "if-then-else" correctly and accurately during the calculations. 

These improvements should help the model to provide more accurate answers and better reasoning.

1. Clearer Prompt: The language model should be more accurately directed to do each step of the process correctly. It should be explicitly told to consider the conditions collectively and avoid the inclusion of equality in the 'greater than' and 'less than' conditions, which was misunderstood in the case of James' weight by the model.

2. Emphasizing Accuracy: The prompt should emphasize the importance of accurate computation and the strict adherence to the conditions provided, especially in the case of mathematical operators.

3. Better Understanding of Terms: The prompt may need to clarify the interpretation of 'greater than', 'less than', and 'equal to', and provide explicit instructions that when a condition specifies 'greater than' or 'less than', it should not include 'equal to'.

4. Verification Step: The prompt can include a step for the model to verify its responses before finalizing them to reduce errors.

5. Use of Conditional Statements: The prompt should guide the language model to use conditional statements like "if-then-else" correctly and accurately during the calculations. 

These improvements should help the model to provide more accurate answers and better reasoning.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find out how many penguins are more than 8 years old, we need to examine the age of each penguin in the updated table.

After deleting Bernard from the table, we have:
- Louis, 7, 50, 11
- Vincent, 9, 60, 11
- Gwen, 8, 70, 15

There are 2 penguins (Vincent and Gwen) who are more than 8 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Reason: 
The reason this question was answered incorrectly comes from misunderstanding the 'greater than' condition. The prompt incorrectly assumes that an age of '8' is 'greater than 8'. This misinterpretation is a common problem in understanding inequalities, where 'greater than' does not include the number it is comparing against. This is likely due to the misunderstanding of the inequality sign in the prompt itself. As such, Gwen, whose age is exactly 8, should not have been included in the count.

Improvement: 
The prompt should clarify that 'greater than' and 'less than' conditions exclude the value that is being compared. It needs to further emphasize understanding the exclusive nature of these conditions. The language model may also need a reminder to review the conditions carefully and ensure each data point meets ALL of the conditions before including it in the result.

Next, the prompt should also include a specification that the conditions apply immediately, meaning that if the data changes (as in this case where Bernard was removed) that the new conditions immediately reflect this change. 

Also, it might be beneficial to encourage the language model to double-check its answer against the problem's conditions to ensure accuracy. In this case, looking back to confirm whether '8' should have been counted as 'more than 8' after getting the final answer would have caught the error.

Therefore, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:
1. Clearer explanation of 'greater than' and 'less than' conditions, emphasizing their exclusivity.
2. Emphasize the need to attend to changes in data and reflect this change immediately.
3. Include a step that requires the language model to double-check the answer against the question's conditions.

<1> Example analysis:

The question is asking for the name of the giraffe that comes last when sorted alphabetically.

The model is expected to sort the list of giraffe names alphabetically, and select the last one. The giraffe names are "Jody", "Gladys", "Marian", and "Donna". Alphabetically sorted, they appear as follows: "Donna", "Gladys", "Jody", "Marian". Therefore, "Marian" is the last name when sorted in alphabetical order, which corresponds to option (C). 

The model's incorrect response indicates that it has misinterpreted the question to simply require choosing the last name in the table as it is presented, rather than rearranging the names into alphabetical order first. This may suggest that the instructions are not clear enough, and the language model doesn't understand that it should rearrange the names. 

<2> Example analysis:

This problem is asking how many giraffes are more than 5 years old. 

From the given table, the number of giraffes more than 5 years old are: "Jody", "Gladys", and "Donna", which total to 3. However, according to the instruction, "more than" means strictly greater, which excludes "Jody" who is exactly 5 years old. Thus, the correct answer is 2 - "Gladys" and "Donna", which corresponds to option (B).

The model's response suggests that it did not correctly interpret "more than" as strictly greater than the stated value, instead, it included a giraffe whose age equals 5 years. 

Prompt improvement aspects:

1. Clarification on interpretation of data: The prompt should specify that the model may need to rearrange or sort the data in the table, if necessary, to answer the question.
  
2. Richness of instructions about the operations: Instructions should emphasize that all operations necessary to answer the question should be completed, including potentially unexpected operations like sorting data.

3. Emphasis on strict inequality: "More than" should be clearly emphasized as meaning strictly greater than the value stated. This might require rephrasing the sentence to emphasize the exclusivity.

4. Context-adaptive instructions: Including instructions that advise the model to carefully consider the specific context of each question (e.g. not all questions will require the same operations or interpretations).

5. Flexibility: The instructions should not restrict the model's operations only to what was told, but to achieve the accurate and logical results.

First Wrong Example Analysis:

Question: "How many penguins are less than 8 years old?"
The model's response: "There are 3 penguins less than 8 years old: Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>."
Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: C

Step by step examination:
1. The model incorrectly interpreted the age of Gwen as less than 8, while the age of Gwen is exactly 8 as given in the data.
2. The model also failed to account for the removal of Bernard from the table. After deleting Bernard from the table, there are only two penguins (Louis and Vincent) that are less than 8 years old.
3. The model then added James to the table who is 12 years old which the model rightly excluded from the count.
Hence, the correct answer is (A) 1 i.e., only Louis is less than 8 years old.

Reasons for the incorrect response:

1. Misinterpretation of 'less than': The language model failed to correctly interpret the term 'less than' in the prompt, counting '8' too which led to counting Gwen.
2. Ignored table updates: The model did not consider that Bernard was removed from the table.

Based on these analyses, here are some aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Clarity of instruction: Make the instruction about the interpretation of 'less than' and 'more than' more explicit. Highlight that 'less than' does not include the number itself.
2. Explicit instruction for table updates: Specifically instruct the language model to take into account any updates (additions or deletions) in the data table.
3. Verification instruction: Add a verification instruction asking the model to cross-verify the facts in the final answer with the data. 
4. Less complex instruction: Simplify the language of the prompt where possible to minimize the risk of misinterpretation.

Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Misunderstanding the language instruction: 
   The prompt uses the phrase 'more than,' which the model understood as including the number mentioned, contrary to the explicit instruction that 'more than' means strictly greater than the stated value. This misunderstanding led to a counting error.

2. Failure to accurately interpret the data: 
   While the model correctly interpreted the data to identify the ages of the giraffes, it faltered in the application of the strict inequality rule implied in the question. The error lies in the model's methodology, not in its interpretation of the data provided.

3. Incorrect counting of data: 
   The number of giraffes with ages strictly greater than 5 years old is 2 in the available table. However, the model included the giraffe with the age of 5 years in its count, therefore incorrectly outputting 3 giraffes.

4. Lack of comprehension: 
   The model failed to grasp the logical interpretation of the term "more than" as explicitly intended in the prompt and overlooked the fact that the age of 5 is not considered "more than" 5.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Clearer instruction: 
   Although the prompt uses 'more than' correctly, to avoid misunderstanding, the instructions could be clearer. For example, "Note: 'more than 5' does not include 5."

2. Emphasizing keywords: 
   Highlight important instructions using different methods such as capitalization or underlining. For instance, "'more than' means STRICTLY GREATER THAN the stated value."

3. Using examples: 
   Including examples to illustrate the instructions might be beneficial. For example, "For instance, if 'more than 5' is stated, only consider numbers 6 and above."

4. Redefining explanations: 
   Clearly defining terms used within the question could help. For example, "Remember, 'more than' refers to numbers strictly greater, not inclusive of the stated number." 

5. Iterative Verification: 
   The model can be prompted to cross-verify its selected answers by reviewing the question and the prompt instructions again. This could increase the accuracy of the model's outputs.

gradient:
Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1. Misinterpretation of 'more than': The language model does not correctly interpret the phrase 'more than' as detailed in the prompt instructions. Despite the prompt explicitly stating that 'more than' signifies strictly greater than the stated value and does not include the stated value, the model counts Gwen, who is 8 years old, as a penguin that is more than 8 years old. This is incorrect as per the instructions.

2. Errors in analyzing the data: The language model is not accurately analyzing the data provided to it. Despite the clarity provided in the prompt to consider 'more than' as strictly greater than, the model still counted the penguin aged 8 as 'more than 8'. 

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Improved clarity on terminology: Although the existing prompt provides detailed instructions, the instructions could be restructured for greater clarity and made more specific. The instruction could label 'more than' as 'exclusive' to avoid misinterpretation. 

2. Inclusion of examples: To further clarify the exact meaning of terms such as 'more than', examples could be added in the prompt that demonstrate how to evaluate these situations.

3. Reflecting on errors: Remind the language model to reflect on the instructions when it made a mistake, this can also guide the model to learn from the errors.

4. Emphasizing key definitions: Bold, underline or capitalize the key definitions or terms to highlight their importance.

The revised prompt could be something like:

"Closely examine the data provided in the table and interpret accordingly. Perform necessary calculations as per the instructions mentioned. When answering multiple-choice questions, pay close attention to the terms used. Specifically, the term 'MORE THAN' means a value that is STRICTLY GREATER THAN the stated number. This means 'MORE THAN 5' does not include 5 and only considers numbers 6 and upwards. For each question, thoroughly check the data and your calculations ensuring the correctness of your answer before choosing the suitable option. Indicate your answer between <answer> and </answer> brackets. Lastly, remember that accuracy can be enhanced by reevaluating your chosen response in light of these instructions."

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg, we need to consider the following penguins from the updated table:

1. Louis: Age = 7, Weight = 11 (Not meeting both criteria)
2. Vincent: Age = 9, Weight = 11 (Not meeting both criteria)
3. Gwen: Age = 8, Weight = 15 (Meets both criteria)
4. James: Age = 12, Weight = 12 (Meets both criteria)

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

So, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the given example, the model correctly understood that "more than" signifies "strictly greater than", but made an error while comprehending the weight requirements in the question. According to the prompt, penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg should be considered. However, the model incorrectly included James, whose weight is exactly 12 kg, not more than 12 kg.

The source of this error seems to be in the understanding or interpretation of the data rather than any issue with the prompt itself. The model correctly followed the prompt to "review the data and your calculations thoroughly", but it seems to make a mistake in its interpretation of the data for James.

It's worth mentioning that the verbose nature of the prompt might make it harder for the model to focus on the essential details of the task.

Prompt Improvement:

1. The current prompt can be simplified to better direct the model’s focus to the key task, so it doesn't get side-tracked by excessive details.

Modified Prompt:
Analyze the data from the table and answer the multiple-choice questions. 'More than' implies STRICTLY GREATER THAN the given number. For instance, 'more than 5' means 6 and above, not 5. In your answer, review your calculations carefully for maximum accuracy. Indicate your answer between <answer> and </answer> brackets. Double-check your answer against the question and instructions.

2. More explicit instruction: The model could be instructed explicitly to pay attention to both conditions together, i.e., 'more than 5 years old' AND 'weigh more than 12 kg.'

Modified Prompt:
While answering, make sure a condition is satisfied ONLY if all the paired requirements are met. For example, a penguin should be 'more than 5 years old' AND 'weigh more than 12 kg', meaning both conditions of age and weight need to be satisfied. Indicate your answer between <answer> and </answer> brackets after careful rechecking.

Overall, the current prompt does a great job of setting expectations and providing instructions for the task; however, simplifying the language and adding clear directives can improve the model's performance.

Example 1: 

Step 1: The prompt provides clear instructions to analyze and interpret data from a table. It asks to pay special attention to the term 'more than' and specifies that it means strictly greater than the stated value. 

Step 2: The provided table data lists the name, age, height, and weight of a number of animals (penguins and giraffes).

Step 3: The question asks, "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?"

Step 4: The model answers: "There are three giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), and Donna (9 years old). Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.". This response is incorrect.

Reason for Incorrect Answer: 
The language model has misunderstood the instruction given in the prompt regarding the term 'more than'. Even though the prompt clearly states that 'more than' means 'strictly greater than', the model considered the giraffe 'Jody' who is exactly 5 years old as being 'more than 5 years old'. The correct answer should have been 'B) 2', because only Gladys and Donna are strictly more than 5 years old.

Looking at the failure of the prompt in this example, the prompt could be improved by providing an example in the prompt itself to illustrate the concept of 'more than'. Though an attempt is made to define 'more than' in the prompt, a practical example could solidify this understanding. Additionally, the prompt should highlight points to consider while processing the table data (like considering each row separately) so that the language model does not skip or misunderstand any data. Including reminders about properly decoding the term 'more than' throughout the instructions might also prevent similar misunderstandings in future. Also, explicitly stating that the model should not consider any value which is equal to the question's value (here 5) in calculation might help. 

Another manner to improve the prompt might be to remove the detailed framing language that is repeated before returning the answer. In current scenario, the model is explicitly asked to validate the responses against the instructions provided at the end of the question. However, it could be that this instruction is being ignored or misunderstood when generating the answer. Ensuring that the instructions are integral to the answering process might improve accuracy. 

Furthermore, re-emphasizing the importance of instructions in the middle and toward the end of the prompt may ensure its adherence. 

In summary, the improvements to prompt are:
1. Provide practical examples within the prompt to illustrate 'strictly greater than'.
2. Include proper guidelines for processing table data.
3. Include repeated reminders about decoding the term 'more than'.
4. Explicitly instruct not to consider equal values.
5. Simplify and highlight instructions to be followed when answering.
6. Re-emphasize the importance of instructions throughout the prompt.

For clarity, if the question states 'more than 5', only numbers 6 and above should be considered - 5 is not included. For each question, make sure to review the data and your calculations thoroughly to ensure the accuracy of your analysis before selecting the appropriate option. Your answer should be indicated within <answer> and </answer> brackets. Remember, cross-verify your selected answer by reassessing the question in light of the instructions given here - this can improve the accuracy of your output.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

<START> Thoroughly scrutinize and interpret the data from the table given below. Abide by the provided instructions to perform the necessary operations. When responding to multiple-choice questions, 'more than' MUST NOT include the specified value. It is essential to understand that 'more than' refers to a value strictly greater than the one mentioned. For instance, if the question states 'more than 5', only consider numbers strictly greater than 5, i.e., starting from 6. Do not include 5 in your consideration. Now, for each question related to this data, be meticulous in examining your calculations to ensure that the correct interpretation has been made. It is crucial to cross-check the role of 'more than' in your calculations. Make sure to encompass your answer within <answer> and </answer>. Re-examine your selected response in accordance with these instructions before concluding – this can potentially increase the precision of your output. 

Remember, 'equal to' is not 'more than'. Every single data point in the table is important and should be considered individually. Take care not to skip or misunderstand any data. Be wary of the specific value given in the question and make a conscious effort not to include that exact value in your calculations if the term 'more than' is used. 

Once again reiterate, if the prompt identifies a value in the context of 'more than', do not include that exact number but consider only the numbers greater than it.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(D) 4</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Incorrect Understanding of 'More than': The prompt made it clear that the phrase 'more than' is used to indicate a value strictly exceeding the stated number. In the question, it is asked how many giraffes are more than 5 years old. Following the instructions in the prompt, the correct interpretation should exclude giraffes that are exactly five years old. However, the model seems to have included the giraffe aged exactly 5 in its count, resulting in the incorrect answer.

2. Lack of Proper Data Analysis: The model failed to accurately analyse the provided data. Specifically, it did not correctly count the number of giraffes that fit the criteria stated in the question. Out of four giraffes, only two are older than 5 years, but the model incorrectly identified four.

3. Misinterpretation of Options: The model may have misinterpreted the answer options. Just because option D (4) was available doesn't mean it's a possible correct answer. It's important for the model to analyze the data accurately rather than making assumptions based on available options.

Based on these reasons, improvements that can be made in the prompt include:

1. Greater Emphasis on Interpreting 'More than': Although the 'more than' instruction is detailed, more emphasis and clarity could help. An example could be integrated into the prompt to demonstrate exclusion of the stated number when applying the 'more than' rule.

2. Reinforcement of Accurate Data Analysis: The prompt could stress the critical importance of correctly analyzing the data before making a decision. This attention to accuracy would encourage the model to double-check its work.

3. Clarification on Interpretation of Options: The prompt might include directive that the model should not infer possible solutions from the available options. Instead, it should be instructed to make its solution based solely on the data analysis and question requirements.

4. Encouragement of Re-evaluation: Although already touched upon in the prompt, there could be more urging for the model to reevaluate its answers to ensure accuracy. A checkpoint process or heuristic for error checking could be helpful.

5. Guidance on Errors: Including a procedure to follow when encountering mistakes could help guide the model toward the correct interpretations and solutions. This can also improve its learning when it makes errors.

gradient:
<1> 

In the given wrong example, the model doesn’t provide an output between the <answer> and </answer> brackets. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Misunderstanding Instructions: The complexity of the prompt with so many instructions, and lack of direct instruction on selecting an option from multiple-choice questions might have led the model to not respond. 

2. Overwhelm with Information: The prompt provides instructions for a series of tasks including calculating, reviewing, interpreting, and self-evaluation. This overabundance can confuse the model.

3. Inconsistent Formatting: The inconsistent formatting in the answer provided as a raw string, e.g., '(4)', might have been misinterpreted by the model.

4. Lack of Explicit Requirements: Even though multiple-choice question answering is implied, the prompt does not directly ask the model to choose one option from the given ones.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

In the given wrong example, the model doesn’t provide an output between the <answer> and </answer> brackets. This could be due to several reasons:

1. Misunderstanding Instructions: The complexity of the prompt with so many instructions, and lack of direct instruction on selecting an option from multiple-choice questions might have led the model to not respond. 

2. Overwhelm with Information: The prompt provides instructions for a series of tasks including calculating, reviewing, interpreting, and self-evaluation. This overabundance can confuse the model.

3. Inconsistent Formatting: The inconsistent formatting in the answer provided as a raw string, e.g., '(4)', might have been misinterpreted by the model.

4. Lack of Explicit Requirements: Even though multiple-choice question answering is implied, the prompt does not directly ask the model to choose one option from the given ones.

To improve this, considering the aspects mentioned above, the revised prompt should:

1. Simplify Instruction: Break down the prompt into simpler sentences and provide direct instructions for each section of the task. 

2. Explicit Choice Selection: Explicitly ask the model to select one of the multiple-choice options.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In the first example, the question asks how many penguins are less than 8 years old. The model reviews the data and correctly identifies that Louis is 7 years old. However, it incorrectly includes Vincent who is actually 9 years old and Gwen who is 8 years old in the count. This is simpy due to a calculation error on part of the model, incorrectly understanding the term 'less than 8'.

<2>
In the second example, the question asks how many penguins are more than 8 years old. The model incorrectly includes penguin Louis who is actually 7 years old, due to confusion with the 'MORE THAN' description, despite being correctly explained in the prompt.

<3>
In the third example, a consistent issue arises where the model is not properly tracking and updating changes made to the table. Despite the prompt clearly stating that a penguin was added to the table, the model incorrectly counts the total number of penguins, ignoring the inclusion of James.

Reasons for failure of the model:

1. Misinterpretation of 'Less Than' and 'More Than': The model is unable to correctly interpret the strict inequalities 'less than' and 'more than'. As a result, it is including penguins who match the integer value exactly as part of the 'less than' and 'more than' count, creating an inaccurate number for the correct answer.

2. Inaccurate Tracking: The model fails to accurately track changes to the table. An addition or deletion within the table is not appropriately accounted for in its calculations, resulting in a discrepancy between the corrected computed count and the model's output.

Based on these identified issues, improvements to the prompt can be made by:

1. Emphasizing the correct interpretation: Strict inequalities should be clarified with more emphasis. The message could be further highlighted by stating that the number itself is NOT included.

2. Highlighting changes to the table: Changes (additions or deletions) to the table need to be emphasized, ensuring the model accounts for these changes in its calculations.

3. Including examples: To reinforce the correct interpretation and calculations, the prompt could include example scenarios that expressly demonstrate how to interpret data according to the 'less than' and 'more than' directives.

4. Stressing attention to detail: The importance of careful reading and analysis of every detail in the prompt and tables/data can be stressed.

Be particularly cautious about key terms, like more than, less than, first, last, highest, lowest, etc., that depict calculation direction, sequence or condition. These terms need to be interpreted exactly, not loosely, as an inch of discrepancy can completely alter the answer's nature. Authenticate your calculations' accuracy before moving to the answer. Present your output in the storytelling format, mapping logical sequence of the steps taken, and pick the correct option from the multiple-choice answers. Place the final answer between <answer> and </answer> markers. If the data provided overshoots the need for the answer, prioritize crucial information over complete usage of the data. If prior predictions turned out wrong, use the elimination method to recheck the correct multiple-choice option. Understand the subtleties of the language set within the questions, and verify your understanding, most importantly if prior interpretations led to an error. Accurate interpretation of the question, keeping granular details in perspective and precise calculations are your keys to getting the right answer. Don't make assumptions; the task is to unveil the clear facts.
