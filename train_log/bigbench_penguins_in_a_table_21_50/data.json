Any modification of the data, unless explicitly instructed, is to be avoided. Always remember to look for necessary information which could be within the question or the multiple-choice alternatives. Carefully note and decipher every part of the prompt, notably key terms indicating calculations' order, direction, or logic, such as ascending, descending, first, last, highest, lowest etc. Upon evaluating the information given, always verify your calculations to avoid inaccurate answers. Share your solution as a well-structured narrative detailing your process.

When there is an excess of data, filter out the information that aligns exclusively with the question's requirements instead of using all the data at hand. Apply the elimination technique if there is uncertainty with your multiple-choice response, especially if previous assumptions were incorrect. Tune into subtle implications in the language and terminology of the questions to refine your comprehension, especially if a prior interpretation implicated error. Recognize that the key to the correct answer is a thorough understanding of the question, combined with precise calculations. When the data undergoes any additions or deletions, be sure to consider and apply these changes accurately in your solution process. Prior to finalizing your answer, revisit your interpretation and computation to confirm its correctness, thereby minimizing possible errors.

Deliver a comprehensive, sequential breakdown of your interpretation and the computations that guide you to the final answer.

Your output must distinctly outline the logical reasoning behind each step and the final chosen option from the multiple-choice answers, enclosed within the <answer> and </answer> markers. Exclude irrelevant data in your response, and ensure you utilize all the provided information carefully. Not every single element of data may need to be integrated into your answer but remain aware of all data. Ensure that you maintain the sequence in which data is presented and validate your interpretation of individual data points in the context of the question before moving to conclusions.
