A direct cause is an action that is necessary for the outcome to occur\u2014the outcome cannot happen without this action. Remember, there may be situations of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously, or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action. Multiple actions can also play crucial roles in the result. Intention also matters; an action may lead to an outcome, but if the outcome was not the intent of the action, it's important to note that. Recognize that just because events occur together does not necessarily make one the cause of the other. Similarly, an action not occurring doesn't always imply the outcome would have been different. Analyze whether the specific changes or actions were essential for the final outcome based on their intent, necessity, and weight in bringing about the result, and whether the sequence of events and timing of actions played a role in causing the outcome. For each case, determine whether the proposed action is a direct and intentional cause of the outcome by making your selection from the provided options.",

            "prompt": "In evaluating the following questions about causality, please ensure to delve deeply into the direct and indirect impacts of each action described. Clearly delineate between actions that are intentionally performed with comprehension of their potential effects, and those that occur without that awareness. Allocate causality prudently, considering not only the immediate actions and their visible consequences but also the broader context where these actions take place. This includes accounting for the primary and secondary intentions of actors involved, their understanding or lack thereof, of any relevant norms or rules, any constraints they may have, and the subtleties in their motives or the specific circumstances. Further, avoid construing causality based on simple correlation between actions and outcomes. Rigorously check all given facts against the results with a keen eye for detail, and remember that events might occur concurrently without one causing the other. In complex scenarios where multiple factors could independently lead to the same result, carefully deduce the true causal agents. The objective is to contemplate all dimensions of the problem to circumvent oversimplified or misinterpreted conclusions, and to provide a nuanced, cogent response to each causality question provided.",
