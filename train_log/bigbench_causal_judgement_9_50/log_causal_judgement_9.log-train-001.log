Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Model's Answer: Yes
Correct Answer: No

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The question asks about causation and intent. Specifically, it wants to know if Bob deliberately hurt the health of the townspeople.
2. From the situation presented, Bob's acknowledged his actions would harm the health of the townspeople, but his primary goal was to steal as much money as possible. He did not care about the side effect of his actions i.e., the adverse health effect on the locals.
3. The model incorrectly attributed malicious intent behind the health-related conditions of the townspeople and considered it as Bob intentionally hurting them.

The prompt may be leading to wrong answers due to the following reasons:
1. It does not clarify the requirements for a cause to be intentional. In this case, Bob was aware of the consequences, but didn't show any intent to harm the health of the townspeople. This subtlety may not be well-captured in the prompt.
2. The prompt only asks to ‘answer questions about causal attribution’ but does not provide any more detail about how the cause should be attributed (for instance, whether ‘intent’ matters in this context).
3. The prompt doesn't specify the context or nuances that need to be considered while attributing causality. Therefore, the model might misinterpret the explicit and implicit nuances or pieces of information in it.

Based on the analysis, the following aspects could improve the prompt:
1. Specify how to attribute causality: Make it clear whether intentions, ignorance, or indirect consequences should be considered when attributing causality.
2. Highlight the need for contextuality: Indicate that the cause attributed should be context-specific and should take into account the entire situation and all its nuances.
3. Include examples: Give a few examples where the model can learn to distinguish the nuances associated with causal attribution. For example, provide cases where despite knowing the harmful effects, if the harm isn't one's primary intent, it's not considered intentional damage.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

(A) Yes
(B) No

Example 1

Analyzing this question shows that it is a case of causal redundancy. Regardless of whether David changed the temperature to HIGH or not, his clothes would still dry in sixty minutes since the dryer was already set to MAX DRY. The model fails to grasp this subtlety, potentially due to the complexity of the scenario. The model encounters a challenge in recognizing that David’s action had no impact on the outcome because it was redundant.

Example 2 

In the second example, the model fails to correctly identify the causal attribution because it appears to assume that the pharmacist’s signature in and of itself had a causal effect. This is again a complex situation where the signature of the attending doctor is the one causing the administration of the drug. The pharmacist only determines whether the drug is in stock and not whether it is safe or appropriate to administer. The model struggles with the nuance and hierarchy involved in these two scenarios.

Based on these observations, the prompts can be improved by:

1. Adding more clarity and guidance: The prompts should help the model understand the nuances and grasp the complexities in multiple-step conditions or actions that make or break causations.

2. Be more specific about the task: The prompts should directly instruct the model to consider all the factors leading to the outcome and to weigh them carefully, understanding that some action has no effect even it initially appears to be contributing to the outcome.

3. Cueing the model to consider redundancy and hierarchy in cause-effect relationships: The prompt could be more explicit in providing cues to the model to check for redundant factors or hierarchal relationships influencing the outcome. 

The improved prompt might look something like this: 

"Answer the following causal attribution questions. Consider each step leading to the outcome. Understand the unique weight of each factor - some steps may be necessary for the outcome, others can be redundant or simply not effective. In hierarchical decision-making processes, not all approvals or actions have the same causative power. Choose the answer that accurately indicates the main cause of the outcome when all factors are taken into account."

Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in.

gradient:
1) Example: 

In the given example, the model misinterprets the causal attribution. It focuses more on the action of Alice logging in, while ignoring that the dual log-in is the cause of the issue, which was initially triggered by Zoe. This suggests that the prompt may have been misinterpreted by the model because it did not fully consider the entire causal chain and instead focused on the latter part of the situation with Alice's action.

Reasons:
- The prompt may not be clear enough in explaining what 'causal attribution' means, leading to the model oversimplifying the situation and focusing on the most immediate event (Alice logging in) as the cause.
- The model might have failed to understand the logic in the question, thus resulting in a wrong response. In this case, the model seems not to grasp the concept of 'unlawful' action (Zoe logging into the computer first) being the primary cause.
  
2) Summary of aspects to improve the prompt:
- The prompt could be clarified to specify that 'causal attribution' means identifying the underlying cause, not simply the last event in a chain of events.
- The prompt could also be improved by adding instructions for the model to consider the complete chain of events in its response, not merely the last action performed.
- The model could be prompted to consider the legality or rules given in the situation while making its prediction.
- Add context for the AI to differentiate between direct and indirect causation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Alex spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The ultimate cause of Alex winning the game was rolling a 12, which resulted in a total greater than 2. The spinner landing on green was just an additional condition that contributed to his win, but it was not the direct cause. Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No
<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the language model appears to confuse the concept of direct and indirect causation. The prompt asks the model to focus on "logical reasoning" and the "attribution of causality". This was supposed to guide the model in understanding that David changing the temperature was not the direct cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes, since the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes even if the temperature was not set on high, as long as the dryer was set to MAX DRY. The indirectness of the causal relationship seems to not have been understood by the model, likely due to the complexity and subtlety involved in casually related scenarios.

Wrong Example 2:

In this instance, the model again made a logical error in understanding the chain of events and their corresponding causations. Alex winning the game was conditional on either the total dice roll being greater than 2 or the spinner landing on green. As both events occurred simultaneously, both actions contributed to the conditions necessary for winning. Attributing the win only to the dice roll is a misinterpretation, highlighting that the model struggles with scenarios where multiple causations exist.

Improvements:

1. Clarification: The prompt needs to emphasize the importance of determining whether an action was necessary for a particular outcome.

2. Multicausality: The prompt needs to guide the model in tackling multi-causal situations. It needs to underline that there may be more than one essential action contributing to the outcome.

3. Subtlety in Causality: The current prompt tells the model to "distinguish between direct and indirect causation". Perhaps this bit could be elaborated for better model interpretation.

4. Detailing: Include more detailed instructions on considering all possibilities and conditions before making causal attributions.

5. Simplify the prompt: It might help to reduce the complexity of the prompt. This could make it easier for the model to comprehend the task.

6. Examples: Including examples illustrating direct and indirect causation as well as multiple causation scenarios could lead to better model comprehension.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

gradient:
Example 1: In this example, the issue arises because the model seems to take "direct or indirect causation" into account. Here, the prompt leaves some room for interpretation, which is possibly why the model chose answer A. David changing the temperature could be seen as an action that indirectly led to the clothes drying, but from a logical standpoint, we know it's not the cause since the dryer dries clothes in sixty minutes either when the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. In this case, since the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, changing the temperature setting did not cause the clothes to dry.

Example 2: This example again reveals an issue with the model's understanding of causality. The way the prompt frames the question confuses the model into thinking that the device was fully charged due purely to it being plugged in and being on the charging pad, while discarding Wayne's inaction (not moving the device) as a potential cause. However, had Wayne moved the device, it might not have charged, making him responsible in a way. 

Example 3: This example describes a complex situation where the model can't make a distinction between an intentional and an unintentional outcome. The problem comes from the wording of the prompt, which does not adequately illustrate the requirement for addressing the complexity of intentions - it emphasizes causality rather than intent.

After careful consideration, the following improvements could be made to the prompt:

1. Clarification on the nature of causality: Make it clear that the causality doesn't necessarily have to be a direct action; it can be the choice or non-action that results in an effect.
2. Specification of importance on the intention: Provide specific guidance that the model should take into account the intentions behind actions, especially in scenarios where the actor's aim doesn't align with the outcome.
3. More clarification on managing complex situations: The prompt should discourage guessing or force-fitting of an answer and promote a more nuanced approach to particularly complex circumstances.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Example 1:

Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Wrong Answer: Yes, David’s clothes dried in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting.

Correct Answer: No, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes, not because he changed the temperature setting, but because the dryer was already set to MAX DRY which can independently cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of Causal Relationship: The model wrongly interprets the setting of the temperature to HIGH as the cause of clothes drying in 60 minutes. This is because the prompt does not specify that the model must distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions. In the given instance, setting the cycle to MAX DRY is a sufficient condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes, irrespective of the temperature setting. 

2. Failure to Recognize Redundancy: The model does not recognize that changing the temperature setting is a redundant action since the MAX DRY cycle can alone achieve the desired result. This can be due to the lack of instructions and emphasis in the prompt on identifying excess/redundant conditions or actions in the chain of events.

Based on these reasons, the following aspects can improve the prompt:

1. Specifying Necessary and Sufficient Conditions: The prompt should specify that the model needs to carefully distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions to ascertain the true cause.

2. Emphasizing Redundancy: The prompt should place emphasis on recognizing and accounting for redundant or extraneous actions when determining the cause.

3. Detailing Cause-consequence Relationships: The prompt should instruct the model to pay close attention to not just rules and conditions, but also how changes in conditions could affect the end result. It should lay greater emphasis on understanding the structural hierarchy of causation and how it impacts the outcome.

Improved Prompt: In order to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality, pay close attention to the chain of events. Understand and apply logical reasoning to distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions. Consider the roles these conditions play in the described situation. Take into account and exclude any redundant conditions or actions that do not contribute to the final outcome. Delve into detail about the cause-consequence relationships, and distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad.

In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob?

<1> Example Analysis:

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Answer: (A) Yes

This question is tricky because it specifically asks if the action of NOT changing the position of the device led to the device being fully charged. Given the statement in the question "Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad," it implies that Wayne’s action of not moving it had a hand in the outcome. 

The reason for the model's wrong answer might be that it misinterpreted the prompt's emphasis on the need for an action to occur. In this scenario, the lack of action (Wayne not moving the device) is a pivotal factor in the outcome. This lack of activity is interpreted as a direct cause. It seems like the model has a hard time understanding the concept of inaction being a cause, which explains why it chose the wrong answer.

<2> Example Analysis:

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Answer: (B) No

This question is focused on 'intention.' While Bob's actions did result in the townspeople's ill health, it explicitly states that Bob did not care one way or another about the health of the townspeople, implying that his intention was not to harm their health, but to steal money. He went ahead with the plan knowing the consequences, but the damage to the townspeople's health wasn't his primary aim.

The possible reason why the model gave a wrong answer is the complexity of the scenario. The story involved many inferences and nuances about human behavior and intentions. The model might have focused on the direct outcome (i.e., the harm inflicted to the townspeople’s health) instead of the underlying intention. It seems the model struggles in discerning indirect results of actions versus the original intention behind the actions.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. The prompt needs to be clearer on the concept of 'lack of action'—that not doing something can also lead to outcomes and can be considered a 'cause'.

2. The prompt should better define and emphasize 'intention' in causation. The results of an action might not necessarily represent the original intention behind the actions.

3. The prompt needs to instruct the model to consider the possibility of multiple causes to an outcome in certain conditions and the nuances of human intentions within complicated scenarios.

4. The model should be guided to assess the detailed context or nuances of the scenario provided and not just focus on the final outcome. This might require focusing on inferential aspects, such as the consequences implied rather than directly stated.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

<1> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
The model answered: (A) Yes

The correct response is (B) No.

Reasoning: In the scenario presented, David's action of changing the temperature to HIGH is irrelevant for drying his clothes in sixty minutes, as the cycle is already set to MAX DRY. As stated in the scenario: "David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH." Therefore, David's clothes drying in sixty minutes is not directly caused by David changing the temperature setting. This is a case of unnecessary action, where the outcome would have occurred even without the action in question.

Reason model might have made a mistake:

1. Misinterpretation of the Cause-and-Effect Relationship: The model probably assumed that by setting the temperature to HIGH, David caused his clothes to dry in sixty minutes. However, the scenario stated that two separate conditions could lead to the same outcome, making David's action irrelevant.

2. Misunderstanding of Direct Cause: The model may not have fully grasped the concept of a "direct cause" as defined in the prompt. The AI model might not differentiate between an action being a “cause” from being a “direct cause”. It simply associates the final outcome to the actions immediately preceding it.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Elaborate on the differentiation between 'Cause' and 'Direct Cause': In the prompt, clarify the concept of 'direct cause' distinguishing it from just an action that happens concurrently with the outcome. Any action that is consubstantial to the result, without which the result wouldn’t occur can be a 'direct cause'.

2. Explain the role of unnecessary actions: Make sure the prompt stresses on the interpretation of unnecessary actions. That is, if an action wasn't needed for the outcome to occur, it does not define a direct cause.

3. Incorporate examples in the prompt: Including an example of a direct cause and a non-direct cause might help the model understand the difference better. This can make it easier for the model to predict the right cause for the outcome. 

4. Expand Explanation on Simultaneous Actions: The prompt could emphasize that an action occurring simultaneously with an outcome does not always make it a direct cause. Similarly, the absence of a specific action doesn’t always mean the outcome would be different.

5. Encourage Deep Examination of the Scenario: Advise the model to carefully examine the scenario and disregard any misleading actions or events that may not directly contribute to the outcome. The model should rely more on logical reasoning over paradigmatic learning.

response:
<START> Carefully analyze the given scenario and determine the ultimate cause that leads to the final outcome. Evaluate all possible conditions, actions, and results meticulously. Understand that a 'direct cause' is a condition or an action without which the final outcome would not have been possible. It's essential to note that there can be scenarios where multiple direct causes could be occurring at the same time, or the outcome may have happened without a particular action taking place. Ensure to contemplate whether the changes or actions taken were vital to the end outcome and whether multiple actions played a significant contribution to the result. It's worth noting that an action happening along with an outcome doesn't automatically mean it's a direct cause - same goes for a lack of action. For a given scenario, you need to decide if the suggested proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by selecting from the given options. Direct cause should not be confused with a mere cause which although can influence the outcome, is not indispensable for it to occur. Provide instances where an action is not necessary for the outcome to occur, it does not establish a direct cause relationship. Carefully identify such scenarios to avoid attributing unnecessary actions to the final result. Similarly, multiple simultaneous actions may not necessarily imply multiple direct causes. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

In the scenario described, determine the direct cause of the final outcome. Consider all conditions, actions, and results carefully. Remember, a direct cause is an action without which the outcome wouldn't have occurred. There may be instances of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action in question. Reflect deeply about whether the changes or actions made were necessary for the final outcome and if more than one action played a pivotal role in the result. Note that an action occurring simultaneously with an outcome does not necessarily imply direct causation, and the lack of an action doesn't always mean the outcome would be different. For each case, indicate whether the given proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by choosing one of the options.

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

The model's response to this prompt was (A) Yes, suggesting that Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. However, the correct answer was (B) No. While Bob's actions contributed to the ill health of the townspeople, it was not Bob's intention to cause them harm. His goal was to steal money. His disregard for their health isn't the same as an intention to harm them. The model seems to confuse responsibility for an outcome (Bob did contribute to their ill health) with intention (Bob did not aim to harm their health).

The model correctly identifies that Alice's login was the second action after Zoe's, which triggered the email being sent. However, the model seems to misinterpret Alice's action as the sole and direct cause of the email. In this scenario, the cause was more complex - both Alice and Zoe loging in simultaneously triggered the email. Specifically, Zoe's unauthorized log in was a necessary condition for the occurrence of the event. Without it, no email would have been sent. The prompt lacks clarification on how to handle complex or multi-factorial causation situations which need considering.

The model's response to this prompt was (A) Yes, suggesting that the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. However, the correct answer is (B) No. In this case, although pharmacist's signature was part of the process, it was not causing the patient's recovery as the pharmacist was simply confirming the availability of the drug, not the appropriateness or effectiveness of it. The misunderstandings seem to come from the vague definition of "direct cause" in the given prompt, which confuses the model. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Clarify the definition of "direct cause": The prompt could benefit from more explicit explanations or examples of what constitutes a "direct cause". 

2. Specify how to handle intentions and outcomes: The prompt omits to explain about the relationship between actual outcomes and intentions. Even though Bob’s actions caused harm to the townspeople, it was not his intention. So, the model might benefit from guidelines on how to evaluate intentionality in causality.

3. Expand on multi-factorial causation: The prompt could elucidate more on how to handle situations where multiple actions or conditions lead up to the final outcome.

4. Explain the difference between correlation and causation: In the third example, the pharmacist’s signature and the patient's recovery were correlated (one followed the other), but not causally related. It is important for the model to differentiate between events that occurred simultaneously and events that cause each other.

5. Provide guidelines on how to handle sequences of events: The model needs more information about how to handle sequences of events and what role timing plays in determining causation. For example, in the second scenario, the timing of both Alice and Zoe's actions led to the outcome, not just one of their actions.

6. Incorporate a more nuanced understanding of cause and effect: While the prompt encourages the model to consider that direct causes could have different influences or weights in various situations, more explicit guidance in evaluating the weight or importance of each factor in producing the outcome might be helpful.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Wrong Example Analysis:

In the example, the model answers the question "Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?" with a "No." The model appears to have misunderstood the causality in the scenario. While it might interpret Wayne's inaction (not changing the position of the device) as lack of causation, the prompt heavily emphasizes that both action and inaction could result in an outcome. In this case, Wayne's inaction directly influences the outcome (the device being charged), making the correct answer "Yes."

2. Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) The prompt's request for "principal intention" may lead the model into a potential misinterpretation. In this example, Wayne's principal intention might not have been to charge the device but merely to confirm it was in place. However, this check led him to decide not to take action, which still resulted in the device charging, making his inaction a fundamental cause. Such scenarios are not clearly accounted for in the prompt.

b) The model might also be biased towards active causation (action leading to outcomes) more than passive causation (the absence of action causing outcomes). Prompt does point out both, but not in an equal measure, creating a potential understanding bias in the model. 

c) The prompt also heavily involves the discernment of "underlying intentions," which could misguide the model into attributing causation strictly to intention-driven behaviors, subtle nuances of non-intentional but still causative inactions may get unnoticed. 

3. Aspects for Improvement:

a) Balance Emphasis: Make sure the prompt treats action and inaction as equally potential causative factors. It shouldn't lean heavily towards either.

b) Direct and Indirect Causes: Include explicit instructions to consider both direct and indirect causes in causality analysis.

c) Clarity of Inaction: Make clear circumstances where inaction can also lead to a direct cause. 

d) Intent and Cause: Reemphasize that intention is not necessary for an outcome to occur. Incidents can occur due to unintentional actions or inactions. 

e) Multiple Causes: The prompt could explicitly ask the model to contemplate scenarios where multiple causes (actions and/or inactions) could lead to an outcome.

The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer:
(B) No

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1. Wrong Example Analysis:

In the example, the model answers the question "Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?" with a "No." The model appears to have misunderstood the causality in the scenario. While it might interpret Wayne's inaction (not changing the position of the device) as lack of causation, the prompt heavily emphasizes that both action and inaction could result in an outcome. In this case, Wayne's inaction directly influences the outcome (the device being charged), making the correct answer "Yes."

2. Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) The prompt's request for "principal intention" may lead the model into a potential misinterpretation. In this example, Wayne's principal intention might not have been to charge the device but merely to confirm it was in place. However, this check led him to decide not to take action, which still resulted in the device charging, making his inaction a fundamental cause. Such scenarios are not clearly accounted for in the prompt.

b) The model might also be biased towards active causation (action leading to outcomes) more than passive causation (the absence of action causing outcomes). Prompt does point out both, but not in an equal measure, creating a potential understanding bias in the model. 

c) The prompt also heavily involves the discernment of "underlying intentions," which could misguide the model into attributing causation strictly to intention-driven behaviors, subtle nuances of non-intentional but still causative inactions may get unnoticed. 

3. Aspects for Improvement:

a) Balance Emphasis: Make sure the prompt treats action and inaction as equally potential causative factors. It shouldn't lean heavily towards either.

b) Direct and Indirect Causes: Include explicit instructions to consider both direct and indirect causes in causality analysis.

c) Clarity of Inaction: Make clear circumstances where inaction can also lead to a direct cause. 

d) Intent and Cause: Reemphasize that intention is not necessary for an outcome to occur. Incidents can occur due to unintentional actions or inactions. 

e) Multiple Causes: The prompt could explicitly ask the model to contemplate scenarios where multiple causes (actions and/or inactions) could lead to an outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) In the scenario described, determine the direct cause of the final outcome. Consider all conditions, actions, and results carefully. Remember, a direct cause is an action without which the outcome wouldn't have occurred. There may be instances of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action in question. Reflect deeply about whether the changes or actions made were necessary for the final outcome and if more than one action played a pivotal role in the result. Note that an action occurring simultaneously with an outcome does not necessarily imply direct causation, and the lack of an action doesn't always mean the outcome would be different. For each case, indicate whether the given proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by choosing one of the options.
(3) In the scenario described, ascertain the pertinent cause or causes leading to the final outcome. Conduct a thorough analysis of all conditions, actions, and results with particular emphasis on the principal intention behind an action or inaction, rather than just the subsequent outcome. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or the lack thereof, which if not taken, the outcome wouldn't have eventuated. Consider instances where multiple direct causes might transpire simultaneously, or situations where the outcome would have unfolded even without the action in question. Contemplate whether the actions or non-actions were integral for the final outcome and if multiple actions contributed significantly to the result. Remember, an action transpiring together with an outcome does not necessarily signify direct causation, while the absence of an action could still result in the given outcome. Evaluate each case, placing emphasis on discerning the underlying intentions, the possible coexistence of multiple causes, and the indirect results of actions or their absence. Determine whether the given statement is a direct, intentional cause of the outcome and choose one of the given options.

<START> Thoroughly analyze the scenario given and determine the relevant cause or causes that led to the final outcome. While evaluating all conditions, actions, and inactions, avoid biases towards active or passive causation. Ensure equal consideration even if the cause was derived from maintaining the status quo, as inaction can also lead to outcomes. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or no action occurred, which, if avoided, would change the final result. Consider if there were multiple factors at play that concurrently led to the outcome. Pay close attention to situations where the consequence would have happened regardless of the performance or absence of the action in question. In your analysis, also consider scenarios where the underlying intentions of actions or inactions may or may not directly influence the outcome. Treat intention-driven and unintentional circumstances equally while assessing the causal relations. An action occurring at the same time as an outcome doesn't automatically imply causation and likewise, the lack of an action doesn't rule out the possibility of that outcome. Evaluate each case and determine whether the ensuing statement is a direct or indirect cause of the outcome. Choose your answer from the provided options. <END>

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1)
Question: Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Model's Incorrect Answer: (B) No
Correct Answer: (A) Yes

Why the prompt led to the wrong answer:

- The prompt's lengthy specifications may have confused the model, leading it to overlook the clear direct link between Jane's action and the computer crashing, which was stated in the question.
- The prompt emphasizes considering the “principal intention” behind an action or inaction. While Jane's principal intention may not have been to crash the computer but to work, the fact remains that her action led directly to the computer crashing.
- The prompt also creates ambiguity as it asks the model to evaluate whether a given action was a "direct, intentional cause." The result is open for interpretation because Jane did intentionally log in at the time, but she may not have intended to cause the crash.

2)
Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Model's Incorrect Answer: (A) Yes
Correct Answer: (B) No

Why the prompt led to the wrong answer:

- The model seems to have struggled with the complexity and ambiguity of the prompt in this regard as well. The word 'intentional' is used in the context where the individual is required to knowingly want a specific outcome, which Bob did not explicitly say. He intended to rob the bank but didn't express concern for affecting the town's health, implying indifference rather than intention.
- The prompt might have led the model to assume causation due to Bob's role in the event. However, while his actions contributed to the situation, it was not a direct and intentional cause of the townspeople's health being harmed.
  
Areas for improving the prompt:

- Simplify the language to help the model accurately identify direct causes.
- Offer clearer definitions or examples of direct causes versus indirect consequences.
- Put less emphasis on the term "intentional" or clarify how to interpret actions that result in an outcome regardless of the intention.
- When referring to multiple causes or actions, it should be made clearer to differentiate between those causing the situation and one which merely contributes to it. 
- The prompt could also benefit from clear instructions on how to handle situations where an action has mixed or unintended results.

cur_prompt: In the scenario described, ascertain the pertinent cause or causes leading to the final outcome. Conduct a thorough analysis of all conditions, actions, and results with particular emphasis on the principal intention behind an action or inaction, rather than just the subsequent outcome. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or the lack thereof, which if not taken, the outcome wouldn't have eventuated. Consider instances where multiple direct causes might transpire simultaneously, or situations where the outcome would have unfolded even without the action in question. Contemplate whether the actions or non-actions were integral for the final outcome and if multiple actions contributed significantly to the result. Remember, an action transpiring together with an outcome does not necessarily signify direct causation, while the absence of an action could still result in the given outcome. Evaluate each case, placing emphasis on discerning the underlying intentions, the possible coexistence of multiple causes, and the indirect results of actions or their absence. Determine whether the given statement is a direct, intentional cause of the outcome and choose one of the given options.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

<1> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Model's answer: Yes

Reason for the wrong answer:
The model seems to view the last action David undertook before the outcome occurred (i.e., his clothes drying in 60 minutes) - the changing of the temperature to HIGH - as the cause of that outcome. This perhaps arises from a failure to fully comprehend the logical structure of the input which states that David's clothes would have dried in 60 minutes if either the cycle was set to MAX DRY (which it was) or if the temperature was set to HIGH. Since the necessary condition for the occurrence of the outcome (the drying of the clothes within 60 mins) was already present, changing the temperature setting to HIGH did not cause the outcome, as it would have occurred even without this action.

<2> 
Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

Model's answer: No

Reason for the wrong answer:
Here, the prompt instructs the model to consider the principle intent behind the action. However, it seems the model might interpret this as meaning the initial or primary intent, which in this scenario was to kill the deer and win the competition, not to shoot the bird-watcher. As such, it may conclude that the man did not intentionally shoot the bird-watcher, even though the man knowingly performed an action that he understood would lead to the bird-watcher being shot. The model might be conflating direct intent with foreseeability or the consequences that are known to be almost certain.

Areas for improvement:

1. Clarity: The prompt could be more explicit in steering the model to properly analyze and distinguish sequential actions and effects and not to mistake the last action taken as the cause of the outcome.
2. Grounding in context: The prompt should guide the model to deeply analyze the text's nuanced context, emphasizing the presence of any pre-existing conditions that would lead to the same outcome despite an action or inaction.
3. Handling of Intent: The prompt needs to provide clearer instructions to the model on how to approach issues concerning intent and foreseeability in action or inaction, focusing on the known consequences of the action, even if they weren't the primary aim.
4. Logical Reasoning: The prompt should direct the model to follow logical reasoning and consider conditions that are not just directly related to the outcome but have effects independent of the final outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) In the scenario described, determine the direct cause of the final outcome. Consider all conditions, actions, and results carefully. Remember, a direct cause is an action without which the outcome wouldn't have occurred. There may be instances of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action in question. Reflect deeply about whether the changes or actions made were necessary for the final outcome and if more than one action played a pivotal role in the result. Note that an action occurring simultaneously with an outcome does not necessarily imply direct causation, and the lack of an action doesn't always mean the outcome would be different. For each case, indicate whether the given proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by choosing one of the options.
(3) In the scenario described, ascertain the pertinent cause or causes leading to the final outcome. Conduct a thorough analysis of all conditions, actions, and results with particular emphasis on the principal intention behind an action or inaction, rather than just the subsequent outcome. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or the lack thereof, which if not taken, the outcome wouldn't have eventuated. Consider instances where multiple direct causes might transpire simultaneously, or situations where the outcome would have unfolded even without the action in question. Contemplate whether the actions or non-actions were integral for the final outcome and if multiple actions contributed significantly to the result.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the wrong example given, the model's response was incorrect. The prompt asks the model to evaluate, among other things, the "primary objective underlying any action or non-action, not just the consequential result." In the example provided, the primary objective of Bob's actions was not to harm the townspeople's health. It was to acquire as much money as he could. The harm caused to the townspeople's health was a foreseeable consequence, but not the primary objective.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of objective: In the example, Bob's primary objective was to gain money, not to harm people. The model may have focused too much on the results – which were detrimental – rather than Bob's stated aims.

2. Neglecting indirect causation: The prompt tries to help the model understand that an action resulting in an outcome doesn't confirm direct causation. However, the model failed to realize that the harm to the townspeople was an indirect result of Bob's actions, not a direct intention.

3. Misunderstanding the model's role: In the scenario, the model seems to profile Bob more based on his actions rather than his main objectives. However, the model was explicitly told to focus on the goals, not just the results.

To improve the prompt, consider the following:

1. Emphasize causation: The model seems to have a hard time understanding the difference between direct and indirect causation. Adding emphasis or more clear instructions on this could lead to more accurate responses.

2. Focus on intent versus result: The model may benefit from an increased focus on the distinction between results and intentions. The model, in this case, needs to evaluate the intentions behind actions rather than looking at the consequences solely.

3. Clear role explanation: Clearly describe the model's task to focus on the underlying motives or intentions, not just the action's impacts.

Improved Prompt: 

In the presented scenario, carefully examine the chain of events leading to the final outcome. In your analysis, pay critical attention to the primary purpose or intent behind any action or non-action, rather than only looking at the consequence that followed. To correctly interpret causation, remember that an action leading to an outcome doesn't automatically mean direct causation. There can be indirect causation where the outcome is more of a side-effect rather than the main aim. Reflect extensively on whether the actions were actually aimed at the final outcome or if there were multiple contributing factors involved. It will also be crucial for you to recognize instances when outcomes could have potentially occurred in the absence of the implicated act. In your response, focus on explaining the underlying motive, rather than simply stating the outcome of an action. Consider the possibility of multiple motives and diverse causes contributing towards a single outcome. Answer whether the action was intentionally aimed at the final outcome or not.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
In the presented scenario, dissect the chain of events leading to the final upshot. Execute a wide-ranging assessment of all stipulations, undertakings, and consequences, paying meticulous attention to the primary objective underlying any action or non-action, not just the consequential result. Understand the concept of direct cause as an act or omission, which if not performed, the outcome wouldn't have materialized. Probe into situations where multiple root causes could coincide at once, or instances where the end would have emerged even without the implicated act. Reflect on whether the actions or omissions were critical to the final outcome and if several actions critically impacted the result. Recall that an action occurring synchronously with an outcome doesn't inherently indicate direct causation whereas an outcome could materialize absent a particular action. Moreover, bear in mind that intention does not necessarily equate to the initial or primary objective, but also includes foreseeable consequences. Explore each case, focusing on unraveling the inherent motives, the plausible presence of diverse causes, and the remote results of actions or the lack thereof. Guess if the mentioned statement is a direct, foreseeable cause of the outcome and choose one of the given options.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For the wrong example given, the model's response was incorrect. The prompt asks the model to evaluate, among other things, the "primary objective underlying any action or non-action, not just the consequential result." In the example provided, the primary objective of Bob's actions was not to harm the townspeople's health. It was to acquire as much money as he could. The harm caused to the townspeople's health was a foreseeable consequence, but not the primary objective.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of objective: In the example, Bob's primary objective was to gain money, not to harm people. The model may have focused too much on the results – which were detrimental – rather than Bob's stated aims.

2. Neglecting indirect causation: The prompt tries to help the model understand that an action resulting in an outcome doesn't confirm direct causation. However, the model failed to realize that the harm to the townspeople was an indirect result of Bob's actions, not a direct intention.

3. Misunderstanding the model's role: In the scenario, the model seems to profile Bob more based on his actions rather than his main objectives. However, the model was explicitly told to focus on the goals, not just the results.

To improve the prompt, consider the following:

1. Emphasize causation: The model seems to have a hard time understanding the difference between direct and indirect causation. Adding emphasis or more clear instructions on this could lead to more accurate responses.

2. Focus on intent versus result: The model may benefit from an increased focus on the distinction between results and intentions. The model, in this case, needs to evaluate the intentions behind actions rather than looking at the consequences solely.

3. Clear role explanation: Clearly describe the model's task to focus on the underlying motives or intentions, not just the action's impacts.

Improved Prompt:

In your analysis, pay critical attention to the primary purpose or intent behind any action or non-action, rather than only looking at the consequence that followed. To correctly interpret causation, remember that an action leading to an outcome doesn't automatically mean direct causation.

Consider the possibility of multiple motives and diverse causes contributing towards a single outcome. Answer whether the action was intentionally aimed at the final outcome or not.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) In the scenario described, determine the direct cause of the final outcome. Consider all conditions, actions, and results carefully. Remember, a direct cause is an action without which the outcome wouldn't have occurred. There may be instances of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action in question. Reflect deeply about whether the changes or actions made were necessary for the final outcome and if more than one action played a pivotal role in the result. Note that an action occurring simultaneously with an outcome does not necessarily imply direct causation, and the lack of an action doesn't always mean the outcome would be different. For each case, indicate whether the given proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by choosing one of the options.
(3) In the scenario described, ascertain the pertinent cause or causes leading to the final outcome. Conduct a thorough analysis of all conditions, actions, and results with particular emphasis on the principal intention behind an action or inaction, rather than just the subsequent outcome. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or the lack thereof, which if not taken, the outcome wouldn't have eventuated. Consider instances where multiple direct causes might transpire simultaneously, or situations where the outcome would have unfolded even without the action in question. Contemplate whether the actions or non-actions were integral for the final outcome and if multiple actions contributed significantly to the result. Remember, an action transpiring together with an outcome does not necessarily signify direct causation, while the absence of an action could still result in the given outcome. Evaluate each case, placing emphasis on discerning the underlying intentions, the possible coexistence of multiple causes, and the indirect results of actions or their absence. Determine whether the given statement is a direct, intentional cause of the outcome and choose one of the given options.
(4) In the presented scenario, dissect the chain of events leading to the final upshot. Execute a wide-ranging assessment of all stipulations, undertakings, and consequences, paying meticulous attention to the primary objective underlying any action or non-action, not just the consequential result. Understand the concept of direct cause as an act or omission, which if not performed, the outcome wouldn't have materialized.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Question Examination:
In the question, the scenario is about Wayne's new high-tech watch, which must be charged before using in the evening. The device, when both plugged in and positioned on the charging pad, gets adequately charged in an hour. At 2:00 PM, Wayne observed that the device was on the charging pad, and so he didn't change its position, leading to the device getting fully charged at 3:00 PM. The question asks whether this charging happened because Wayne did not move the positioning of the device.

Wrong Answer Examination:
The model answered that the device got fully charged not specifically because Wayne did not alter the device's position but because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad. This is incorrect because Wayne's action of not moving the device (a non-action or omission) directly led to the device being charged, as that had a direct bearing on the device's placement on the charging pad.

Examining why the model might have gotten it wrong:

1. Interpretation of direct cause: The model may have misinterpreted the factor of 'direct cause', misunderstanding it as solely the device being plugged in and placed on the charging pad.

2. Misunderstanding of non-action: The model might not have considered the significance of Wayne's non-action (not changing the device's position) in this scenario. This non-action directly contributed to the outcome.

3. Inadequate emphasis on multiple causes: Even though the prompt asked the model to consider situations where multiple causes coincide, the model only focused on the most salient causes — the device being plugged in and on the charging pad.

Improvements to the prompt:

Based on the examination of why the model might have gotten it wrong, the following improvements are suggested:

1. Clarification on non-actions: The prompt could benefit from more emphasis on how non-actions can be as critical as actions in determining an outcome.

2. Greater clarity on simultaneous causes: Provide more precise instructions to weigh each factor separately and then consider their combined effect.

3. Emphasize nuanced understanding of 'direct cause': More clear instructions on how multiple factors, including non-actions, can be jointly the direct causes of an event, might help the model provide a better response.

4. Clarify interpretation of scenarios: Emphasize the need to thoroughly understand the presented scenario, ensuring proper consideration of all details, including any actions, non-actions, stipulations, and their relation to the outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

<1> 
Problem: The problem in this situation is the complex uncovering of motivations behind the actions. The prompt's emphasis on the primary objective might have led the model to infer that Bob's decision to rob the bank, which subsequently caused the illness amongst the townspeople, was an intentional act on his part. Despite Bob claiming that he doesn't care about the townspeople's health, his decision led directly to their illness, which the model misconstrued as intent.

<2> 
Problem: In this scenario, the model likely failed to discern that there were two independent conditions under which the clothes would dry in sixty minutes. David's amendment to the temperature setting was unnecessary in this case, due to the "MAX DRY" status. This is relatively complex causation, and the model might have struggled to grasp that multiple outcomes can independently lead to the same result.

In Summary:
The current prompt might cause mistakes due to:
1. Ambiguity in distinguishing between direct causation and intent - The model needs to better understand that actions leading to outcomes don't necessarily imply intent.
2. The model has difficulty reconciling multiple primary causes - if an outcome can materialize from multiple distinct causes, the model needs to account for that.

Improved Prompt:
In the provided scenario, delve into the series of occurrences to deduce the final resolution. Carry out an exhaustive analysis of the events, actions, consequences, and potential causes or reasons - all while maintaining a strict focus on the underlying intentions or lack thereof, of the characters involved. Understand that an act or omission may directly lead to an outcome; however, it doesn't always signify an intention to cause that outcome. Dive into situations where multiple factors come together to lead to an outcome or circumstances where an outcome could have arisen even without any direct act. Remember, an act happening concurrently with an outcome does not suggest direct causation, and consider how multiple causes can coexist or operate independently leading to the same outcome. Moreover, acknowledge that despite foreseeable consequences, an action might not directly correlate to the perpetrator's initial or primary objective. Explore each situation, focusing on the uncovering of probable motives, likely existence of diverse causes, and unforeseen results of actions or their absence. Determine if the described action was a direct or reasonably anticipated cause of the outcome and opt for the most appropriate answer from the given choices.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) In the scenario described, determine the direct cause of the final outcome. Consider all conditions, actions, and results carefully. Remember, a direct cause is an action without which the outcome wouldn't have occurred. There may be instances of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action in question. Reflect deeply about whether the changes or actions made were necessary for the final outcome and if more than one action played a pivotal role in the result. Note that an action occurring simultaneously with an outcome does not necessarily imply direct causation, and the lack of an action doesn't always mean the outcome would be different. For each case, indicate whether the given proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by choosing one of the options.
(3) In the scenario described, ascertain the pertinent cause or causes leading to the final outcome. Conduct a thorough analysis of all conditions, actions, and results with particular emphasis on the principal intention behind an action or inaction, rather than just the subsequent outcome. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or the lack thereof, which if not taken, the outcome wouldn't have eventuated. Consider instances where multiple direct causes might transpire simultaneously, or situations where the outcome would have unfolded even without the action in question. Contemplate whether the actions or non-actions were integral for the final outcome and if multiple actions contributed significantly to the result. Remember, an action transpiring together with an outcome does not necessarily signify direct causation, while the absence of an action could still result in the given outcome. Evaluate each case, placing emphasis on discerning the underlying intentions, the possible coexistence of multiple causes, and the indirect results of actions or their absence. Determine whether the given statement is a direct, intentional cause of the outcome and choose one of the given options.
(4) In the presented scenario, dissect the chain of events leading to the final upshot. Execute a wide-ranging assessment of all stipulations, undertakings, and consequences, paying meticulous attention to the primary objective underlying any action or non-action, not just the consequential result. Understand the concept of direct cause as an act or omission, which if not performed, the outcome wouldn't have materialized.

Reflect on whether the actions or omissions were critical to the final outcome and if several actions critically impacted the result.

Become familiar with the notion of direct cause as an action or omission which, if undone, the consequence wouldn't have ensued. Delve into scenarios where numerous principal causes could intersect at once, or cases where the consequence would have materialized even in the absence of the implicated action. Upon reviewing, ascertain whether the deeds or their absence were crucial to the final outcome, and if multiple actions had a substantial impact on the result. Keep in mind that an action happening simultaneously with an outcome doesn't inevitably imply direct causation, and a certain outcome could potentially transpire absent a specified action. Importantly, recognize that intention does not always reflect the original or primary goal, but also encompasses foreseeable aftermaths. Investigate each case intimately to unravel innate motives, the possible co-existence of varying causes, and the distant repercussions of actions or inactions. Evaluate if the given statement is a direct, foreseeable cause of the outcome and select the best matching answer from the options provided. <END>

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Consider all circumstances, actions, rules, and conditions described within the situation. Apply deductive reasoning to ascertain the root cause and respond to the question about causal attribution. In your answer, distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while also considering the effect of action versus inaction, and the intention behind the actions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the direct cause of the device being fully charged at 3:00 PM is the fact that it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, as stated in the scenario. Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged, but it indirectly contributed to the outcome by ensuring that the device remained in the correct position for charging.

Therefore, the device is fully charged not because Wayne did not change the position of the device, but because it was plugged in and on the charging pad as required.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In example 1, the language model gets it wrong because it's failing to recognize the nature of 'action vs inaction'. Wayne's decision to not move the device was an action based on an accurate assessment of the situation. The prompt does not explain clearly that inaction under certain circumstances can also be considered an action with its own set of consequences. 

Example 2 is another depiction of the machine's inability to correctly interpret the concept of 'intention'. While Bob indeed carried out actions that resulted in harm, the harm was a side effect to the primary intent of acquiring money. However, due to lack of emphasis on intentionality in the prompt, the model mistakenly attributes the incidental consequence as a part of Bob's intention. 

Example 3 is a formatting error driven by the prompt's instruction. The model understood the question correctly and gave the correct response but didn't follow the requested format (the provision of answer choice in brackets) correctly. The prompt needs to be edited so its phrasing leads the model's output into the requested format.

To improve the prompt:
1. The relationship between 'action vs inaction' needs to be more clearly defined, including how inaction can be considered an action under certain circumstances.
2. Clearer instructions about understanding and interpreting 'intention' behind actions need to be incorporated in the prompt.
3. More explicit instruction regarding the output format needs to be added to the prompt to avoid incorrect formatting in the response.
4. You could also include instructions for the model to determine whether actions were intentional or unintentional based on the underlying motives, consequences, and scope of knowledge of the actor involved. 
5. The prompt could include more explicit instructions about deducing direct and indirect causation based on the sequence of events, actions taken, and the final result.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the direct causation can be attributed to David changing the temperature setting on the dryer. By setting the temperature to HIGH, he ensured that the conditions necessary for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes were met. Therefore, the direct cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes was David's action of changing the temperature setting.

gradient:
For the wrong example:

The mistake arises from the model's understanding of causation based on the current prompt. Apparently, the model sees changing the temperature setting as a necessary action for dry the clothes in sixty minutes. However, the situation explicitly said that 'David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set on MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH'. Hence, even if David didn't change the temperature setting, the clothes would still dry in sixty minutes because the dryer cycle was already set to MAX DRY.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of Conditional Statements: The model failed to correctly interpret the conditional statement in the situation. It did not understand that whether David changed the temperature setting or not, the clothes would still dry in sixty minutes because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. It perceived that David's action was necessary for the clothes to dry, which was not the case.

2. Inattention to Action versus Inaction: The prompt advises the model to consider the effect of action versus inaction. In this case, the model did not understand that David's inaction (i.e., not changing the temperature setting to HIGH) would not have affected the outcome.

3. Lack of Robustness in Identifying Causation: The model failed to notice David's action to change the temperature was not a direct cause for his clothes to dry in sixty minutes as the dryer was initially set to MAX DRY, which would have facilitated the drying process even without changing the temperature.

Improvements for the prompt based on these reasons:

1. Clarify Conditional Statements: Make it clear that the model should properly interpret conditional statements in situations, particularly if they impact the outcome regardless of certain actions.

2. Emphasize Action vs Inaction: Reinforce the need to consider that sometimes an inaction, like not changing the temperature setting, would lead to the same outcome.

3. Causal Reasoning: The prompt could place more emphasis on identifying the real cause irrespective of whether an action was performed. This would guide the model to differentiate between independent and dependent events that lead towards the outcome.

4. Prompt should stress that not every action contributes to the outcome: Ensure the model understands that sometimes, actions performed may not necessarily contribute to the result, but it could be due to other existing conditions as well. 

In summary, the model must be able to understand and reason with nuanced conditional information, prioritize relevant over irrelevant actions, and discern independent factors contributing to the outcome.

4. Prompt should stress that not every action contributes to the outcome: Ensure the model understands that sometimes, actions performed may not necessarily contribute to the result, but it could be due to other existing conditions as well. 

In summary, the model must be able to understand and reason with nuanced conditional information, prioritize relevant over irrelevant actions, and discern independent factors contributing to the outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) Consider all circumstances, actions, rules, and conditions described within the situation. Apply deductive reasoning to ascertain the root cause and respond to the question about causal attribution. In your answer, distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while also considering the effect of action versus inaction, and the intention behind the actions. If the situation demands, contemplate the complexity of the context and don't force-fit an answer, rather provide a nuanced explanation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the direct cause of the device being fully charged at 3:00 PM is the fact that it was both plugged in and on the charging pad at 2:00 PM. This direct causation is what led to the device being fully charged within the hour. Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged, as the device would have still charged even if he had moved it.

Therefore, the device is fully charged not because Wayne did not change the position of the device, but because it was plugged in and on the charging pad. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the root cause of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address is the simultaneous login of Alice and Zoe, which violates the company's policy. The direct causation can be attributed to Zoe for logging in at 9 am when she was not supposed to, leading to Alice logging in later and triggering the email. However, the indirect causation can also be attributed to Alice for logging in after Zoe was already logged in, contributing to the occurrence of the empty email being sent.

Considering the effect of action versus inaction, both Zoe's action of logging in early and Alice's action of logging in later played a role in causing the empty email to be sent. The intention behind Zoe's action was to access the central computer earlier than allowed, while Alice's intention was to follow the official policy but ended up causing the email to be sent due to the violation by Zoe.

Therefore, in this scenario, both Zoe and Alice can be seen as contributing to the cause of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the direct cause of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes is the change in the temperature setting to HIGH. This is because the condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes is either the cycle being set to MAX DRY or the temperature being set to HIGH. Since the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, the change in the temperature setting to HIGH directly led to the clothes drying in the specified time frame.

Therefore, the answer to the question is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
In this example, the error arises due to a confusion around action versus inaction. Wayne's act of non-interference (inaction) is the indirect cause of the device being charged because it already met the conditions for charging: it was connected and on the pad. The model incorrectly redirected the focus to the direct action (device being connected and on the pad) but failed to recognize the causal impact of the inaction, which was the focus of the question.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
In this instance, the error made is based on a misunderstanding of compound causality. The prompt emphasizes individual actions, thus the model explicitly recognizes both Alice and Zoe's log-ins as separate causes of the event. However, the question is framed in a way that Alice’s action (logging in) cannot cause the effect (email being sent) alone, without the precursory action of Zoe's log-in. The model failed to recognize this nuance.

<3> Wrong Example Analysis:
The error in this example stems from confusion between direct and indirect causality. The model saw David's action of setting the temperature to HIGH as the direct cause for the clothes drying in 60 minutes. However, the clothes could have dried in 60 minutes even without David changing the temperature, because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. Thus, David’s action was not a necessary condition for achieving the effect.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify the concept of "Necessary and Sufficient" conditions: The prompt should urge the model to identify whether the causes were necessary, sufficient, or both in bringing about the effect. This might help in accurate determination of direct and indirect causation.

2. Emphasize on Compound Causality: Improve instructions to let the model to better understand a chain of causality, especially in situations where one event is dependent on a prior event.

3. Better distinguish between action and inaction: The prompt should be more explicit on considering both actions and inactions as legitimate causes, and to better understand their causal impact based on the given situation.

4. Guide on Context-based Decision: The prompt should direct the model to decide causality based on context, rather than general rules. The model needs to understand that the context of the problem can drastically change the ascription of causal attribution.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman clearly demonstrated a lack of concern for the health and well-being of the townspeople. When presented with the information that the plan to rob the bank would harm the townspeople by making them more susceptible to a poison in the water supply, Bob explicitly stated that he did not care about the potential consequences and only wanted to steal money. This shows a deliberate disregard for the health of the townspeople, indicating that Bob intentionally harmed them in pursuit of his own goals. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:
The task asked the language model to evaluate if Bob, the henchman, "intentionally" harmed the health of the townspeople. In its response, the model focuses heavily on Bob's disregard for the townspeople's health and well-being, leading it to answer that Bob did intentionally harm them. However, the model failed to accurately assess Bob's intention. From the given case, we learn that Bob's primary intention was to rob the bank and acquire a large amount of money, not to harm the townspeople. The detrimental effect on the townspeople was a secondary outcome that Bob accepted, but this does not necessarily mean that he intended it to occur. Therefore, the model got the answer wrong.

Reasons:
1. The prompt focuses heavily on analyzing the direct and indirect causation in the given scenario. It also emphasizes aligning an action with an intention. Hence the model, following this instruction, perceives Bob's acceptance of the collateral damage as an indication of his intention to cause harm, rather than understanding it as an apathy or disregard towards the damage.
2. The prompt encourages distinguishing between actions and inactions, but does not sufficiently highlight the importance of understanding the primary and secondary motivations of a character. This results in the model's partial understanding of causation, not fully exploring the nuances of intention behind the action.
3. The prompt, while asking to provide a comprehensive explanation, does not firmly instruct the model to differentiate between disregard for an outcome (knowing but not caring) and intention for the same outcome to occur.

Improvements:
1. The prompt can be improved by specifically asking the model to discern the primary intention of the character from the possible consequences of their actions, and whether they clearly intended these consequences.
2. The prompt should stress on differentiating between characters knowing about potential harmful outcomes and intending such outcomes.
3. The prompt can include a clear directive to consider potentially complex motivations behind a character's actions, allowing the model to weigh actions and intentions accurately.
4. The prompt could instruct the model to consider if a harmful outcome is a deliberate goal of a character or simply a byproduct they are indifferent about.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the pharmacist's decision to sign off on the drug request did play a role in causing the patient's recovery. The intern needed the pharmacist's signature to confirm that the hospital had enough of the drug in stock, which was a necessary condition for administering it to the patient. Without the pharmacist's approval, the drug could not have been given to the patient, and therefore the recovery would not have occurred. The pharmacist's action of signing off on the request directly contributed to the patient receiving the drug, which ultimately led to the positive outcome of recovery.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, we can analyze the causation of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes. The given conditions state that the clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Initially, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, but the temperature was not set to HIGH. David then changed the temperature setting to HIGH and turned on the dryer.

In this situation, we can identify the direct causation of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes to be the action of David changing the temperature setting to HIGH. By setting the temperature to HIGH, David fulfilled the necessary condition for the clothes to dry within the specified time frame. The change in the temperature setting directly led to the desired outcome of the clothes drying in sixty minutes.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?" is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong example analysis: 
Here the question is asking whether the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. The reasoning provided by the model is incorrect because it attributes the causation of the recovery to the pharmacist's approval. The procedure could not have happened without the pharmacist's approval, but his approval didn't lead to the recovery, as his role is merely procedural and he plays no part in the decision-making regarding the patient’s treatment. The approval by the pharmacist was a necessary condition for the drug to be administered, however, it was not sufficient cause because the context tells us that the drug (a new, beneficial compound) and the doctor's clinical judgement (despite the known risks) are more directly related to the positive outcome. 

<2> Wrong example analysis: 
In this scenario, the model is incorrectly marking David's action of changing the temperature as the cause for the clothes being dried in sixty minutes. The prompt doesn't clearly instruct the model to differentiate between a necessary and a sufficient condition. The model failed to recognize that in this case, either the setting MAX DRY or temperature HIGH is sufficient to dry the clothes in sixty minutes. Before David changed the temperature setting, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, which was a sufficient condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. Therefore, David changing the settings does not cause the effect of the clothes drying in the given time.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clarify the importance of differentiating between necessary and sufficient conditions. A necessary condition is something that must be true for the result to occur, while a sufficient condition is something that, if it is true, will produce the result. 

2. Include a directive to check if the 'cause' under consideration can be objectively identified as the 'cause' or if there may be other contributing factors that should be taken into account. This improvement can be useful in situations where multiple actions or circumstances might contribute to the effect.

3. Encourage the AI to evaluate the weight of each action or condition in the context of the overall situation, depending on whether the situation requires such analysis.

4. Instruct the AI to assess if the direct cause of the effect could take place independently of the cause under consideration, as in example 2.

5. Prompt the AI to consider the general roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the situation when determining causation. For instance, the pharmacist's role is procedural, while the doctor's role is more directly linked to the patient's health outcome. 

6. In the prompt, specifically ask the AI to examine if the cause under consideration is the primary reason for an effect or just one of many conditions that needed to be fulfilled for the effect to take place.

The revised prompt could read: 
Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions presented in the given situation. Distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions, and between direct and indirect causation. Evaluate the weight of each action or condition in the context of the overall situation. If the situation requires, consider the role and responsibility of each person involved. In addition, assess if the effect could take place independently of the cause under consideration. Reflect upon the necessity or sufficiency of the described conditions and assess the chain of events. Bear in mind, the attribution of causality may differ based on situational specificity. Encapsulate your nuanced understanding of the situation in your answer and place the chosen answer option within <answer> and </answer>.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, we can analyze the causation of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes. The given conditions state that the clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Initially, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, but the temperature was not set to HIGH. David then changed the temperature setting to HIGH and turned on the dryer.

In this situation, we can identify the direct causation of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes to be the action of David changing the temperature setting to HIGH. By setting the temperature to HIGH, David fulfilled the necessary condition for the clothes to dry within the specified time frame. The change in the temperature setting directly led to the desired outcome of the clothes drying in sixty minutes.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?" is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Wrong example analysis: 
Here the question is asking whether the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. The reasoning provided by the model is incorrect because it attributes the causation of the recovery to the pharmacist's approval. The procedure could not have happened without the pharmacist's approval, but his approval didn't lead to the recovery, as his role is merely procedural and he plays no part in the decision-making regarding the patient’s treatment. The approval by the pharmacist was a necessary condition for the drug to be administered, however, it was not sufficient cause because the context tells us that the drug (a new, beneficial compound) and the doctor's clinical judgement (despite the known risks) are more directly related to the positive outcome. 

<2> Wrong example analysis: 
In this scenario, the model is incorrectly marking David's action of changing the temperature as the cause for the clothes being dried in sixty minutes. The prompt doesn't clearly instruct the model to differentiate between a necessary and a sufficient condition. The model failed to recognize that in this case, either the setting MAX DRY or temperature HIGH is sufficient to dry the clothes in sixty minutes. Before David changed the temperature setting, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, which was a sufficient condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. Therefore, David changing the settings does not cause the effect of the clothes drying in the given time.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clarify the importance of differentiating between necessary and sufficient conditions. A necessary condition is something that must be true for the result to occur, while a sufficient condition is something that, if it is true, will produce the result. 

2. Include a directive to check if the 'cause' under consideration can be objectively identified as the 'cause' or if there may be other contributing factors that should be taken into account. This improvement can be useful in situations where multiple actions or circumstances might contribute to the effect.

3. Encourage the AI to evaluate the weight of each action or condition in the context of the overall situation, depending on whether the situation requires such analysis.

4. Instruct the AI to assess if the direct cause of the effect could take place independently of the cause under consideration, as in example 2.

5. Prompt the AI to consider the general roles and responsibilities of individuals involved in the situation when determining causation. For instance, the pharmacist's role is procedural, while the doctor's role is more directly linked to the patient's health outcome. 

6. In the prompt, specifically ask the AI to examine if the cause under consideration is the primary reason for an effect or just one of many conditions that needed to be fulfilled for the effect to take place.

The revised prompt could read: 
Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions presented in the given situation. Distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions, and between direct and indirect causation. Evaluate the weight of each action or condition in the context of the overall situation. If the situation requires, consider the role and responsibility of each person involved. In addition, assess if the effect could take place independently of the cause under consideration. Reflect upon the necessity or sufficiency of the described conditions and assess the chain of events. Bear in mind, the attribution of causality may differ based on situational specificity.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the root cause of the device being fully charged at 3:00 PM is not solely due to Wayne not changing the position of the device. The direct causation of the device being fully charged lies in the fact that it was both plugged in and on the charging pad at 2:00 PM. This combination of conditions was necessary and sufficient for the device to fully charge by 3:00 PM. Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device did not directly contribute to the device being fully charged, as the device would have still charged even if he had moved it. Therefore, the device is fully charged not because Wayne did not change the position of the device.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman clearly demonstrated a lack of concern for the health and well-being of the townspeople. When presented with the information that the plan to rob the bank would result in harming the townspeople through increased susceptibility to a poison in the water supply, Bob explicitly stated that he did not care about the potential consequences and only wanted to steal money. Despite being aware of the harm that would be caused to innocent individuals, Bob proceeded with the plan, leading to the severe illness of many townspeople.

Based on Bob's actions and statements, it can be inferred that he intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. His disregard for the consequences and his sole focus on personal gain demonstrate a deliberate choice to prioritize his own interests over the well-being of others. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In the first example, the model failed to correctly analyze the impact of Wayne's inaction (not changing the posture of the device). Even though Wayne's action was not the direct cause, it was indirectly a necessary condition. He had the choice to move it or not move it but by not moving it, he ensured the successful charging because the device needs to be both plugged in and on the pad. So his inaction is indeed a cause. The prompt does not stress enough that 'inaction' can also be a cause and should instruct the model to consider inaction as a possible cause.

In the second example, the model misunderstood the idea of 'intention.' While it is true that Bob did not care about the consequences of his actions, and acted with knowledge that there would be harm to the townspeople, he specifically stated his intention was not to harm the townspeople but to steal as much money as he could. The harm to the townspeople is a side effect of his action, but it's not his intended goal. Therefore, he did not intentionally harm the townspeople. The prompt does not place enough emphasis on the differentiation between intention and outcome or consequences.

To improve the prompt you could:

1. Clarify the role of inaction in causality, emphasizing that inaction can also be taken as a cause depending on the context.
2. Put more emphasis on the difference between an intended outcome and an unintended side effect. Intent should be grounded in the goals of the actor, not the consequences of their actions.
3. Explain better the concept of 'necessary' and 'sufficient' causes. Some factors like Wayne's inaction in the first example might not be sufficient alone to cause the effect (the device to charge), but it was necessary in the context provided.
4. Add more clear guidelines on how to use and evaluate context specificity when attributing causal factors. 
5. Highlight the need to consider the complexity and nuances of intention, necessary and sufficient conditions, and direct and indirect causation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this situation, the necessary condition for an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address is having two people logged in at the same time. The sufficient condition is not explicitly stated but can be inferred as the combination of two people being logged in and the system triggering the sending of an empty email in response to this situation.

Alice logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe is already logged in is a necessary condition for the empty email to be sent. However, it is not a sufficient condition on its own. Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am, violating the official policy, is also a necessary condition for the empty email to be sent. Therefore, both Alice and Zoe's actions are necessary for the outcome to occur.

In terms of direct causation, Alice's action of logging in after Zoe is indirectly linked to the empty email being sent. If Alice had followed the official policy and not logged in when Zoe was already logged in, the empty email would not have been triggered. Therefore, Alice's action can be considered a contributing factor to the outcome.

Considering the roles and responsibilities of each person involved, both Alice and Zoe share responsibility for the empty email being sent. Alice's action of logging in when Zoe was already logged in played a role in the outcome, but Zoe's initial violation of the policy was also a crucial factor.

Given the analysis of necessary and sufficient conditions, direct and indirect causation, and the roles of Alice and Zoe in the situation, it can be concluded that Alice did cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) In the first example, the question asked is, "Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?". The model incorrectly implies that Alice's logging in was a necessary condition, but this is a misinterpretation. Alice's action was just one part of the condition, the other part being Zoe's inappropriate login. Without Zoe's initial violation, Alice logging in would have not resulted in a mis-send. 

Explanation: The prompt errs in treating the scenario as if Alice's logging in alone could result in the email mishap. That is not correct - Zoe's action of logging in out of authorized hours is the root cause. The model also assigned causality to both Alice and Zoe, when in reality, the direct cause is Zoe's policy violation. The model should have been guided to consider individual actions in isolation and their potential cause and effect. 

2) The model provides an exhaustive causation analysis but fails to focus on the specific cause-effect relationship asked in the question. The model could better direct its focus to only relevant causes. In this case, the model should have limited its attention to Alice's action and its direct consequence, not the overall situation.

Explanation: While comprehensive investigation is usually advantageous, it can lead to over-complication in simpler scenarios. Diverging from the core causality question to discuss broader implications can obscure the accurate deduction of an effect's direct cause.

3) The prompt provided does not stress on the rules and consequences that can alter or influence the causality in the given scenario.

Explanation: The company policy clearly states that only one person should be logged in at a time, Alice in the morning and Zoe in the afternoon. Zoe's violation is the breach that causes the unwanted effect. The model should have been nudged to consider this rule in its causality estimation. 

Based on these reasons, the following improvements are proposed for the prompt:

- The prompt should guide the model to consider the effect of individual actions in isolation, this will help the model clearly identify the root cause in simpler scenarios.
- The prompt should emphasize on leveraging governing rules or policies as they largely define causation in the artificial context.
- The prompt should instruct the model to limit its causality assessment to only those actions that are directly tied to the question rather than conducing a comprehensive investigation for all actions. Too much information can lead to erroneous conclusions.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) Consider all circumstances, actions, rules, and conditions described within the situation. Apply deductive reasoning to ascertain the root cause and respond to the question about causal attribution. In your answer, distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while also considering the effect of action versus inaction, and the intention behind the actions. If the situation demands, contemplate the complexity of the context and don't force-fit an answer, rather provide a nuanced explanation.
(3) Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions presented in the given situation. Use deductive reasoning to determine the root cause and answer the question addressing causal attribution. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while paying attention to actions as well as inactions, taking into account both necessary and sufficient causes. Consider if the cause is a result of a series of actions or if it can stand alone in causing the effect. Acknowledge the effects of intention behind actions or lack thereof in your deliberation. Reflect upon the necessity or sufficiency of the described conditions and assess the chain of events. In situations that warrant it, consider the complexity and nuances of the context, bearing in mind that the attribution of causality may differ based on situational specificity. Provide a comprehensive explanation in your answer, encapsulating your nuanced understanding of the situation rather than seeking to fit it into predetermined interpretations. At the conclusion of your response, place the chosen answer option within <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM because it met both necessary and sufficient conditions for charging - being plugged in and being on the charging pad. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged. Therefore, the device is not fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the necessary condition for the clothes to dry in that time frame was met when David changed the temperature setting to HIGH. Since the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, the clothes would dry in sixty minutes if the temperature was set to HIGH. Therefore, David changing the temperature setting directly influenced the outcome of the clothes drying in sixty minutes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Question: 
Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Wrong Answer: 
(B) No 

Analysis: 
In the given situation, Wayne maintaining the device's position on the charging pad is considered an action of inaction, meaning he didn't physically change or alter anything, but rather left the device as it was. In this analysis, the AI model viewed the action of inaction (Wayne not moving the device) as a passive state, while it seems the question requires an understanding that this still contributed to the device's charging.

<2> 
Question: 
Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Wrong Answer: 
(A) Yes

Analysis: 
The AI model understands the direct actions taken by David (changing the temperature setting), but fails to recognize that the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes even without this change (since the cycle was already set to MAX DRY). The model does not grasp "unnecessary causes/effects", or effects resulting from extra, unneeded steps.

<3> 
Question: 
Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Wrong Answer: 
(A) Yes 

Analysis: 
The model does not differentiate well between direct and indirect responsibility. Even though Bob indirectly harmed the townspeople through his actions (which was his intention), his direct intention was to steal as much money as he could, not to harm the townspeople (a consequence of his action but not his main motivation).

Improvements: 

1. Clarify the concept of inaction as also having an impact in certain situations.
2. Highlight the importance of understanding unnecessary causes/effects.
3. Distinguish between direct intentions/outcomes and indirect or consequential outcomes.
4. Include a component to analyze the main motivation behind actions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM because it met both necessary and sufficient conditions for charging - being plugged in and being on the charging pad. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged. Therefore, the device is not fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device.

Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) Consider all circumstances, actions, rules, and conditions described within the situation. Apply deductive reasoning to ascertain the root cause and respond to the question about causal attribution. In your answer, distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while also considering the effect of action versus inaction, and the intention behind the actions. If the situation demands, contemplate the complexity of the context and don't force-fit an answer, rather provide a nuanced explanation.
(3) Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions presented in the given situation. Use deductive reasoning to determine the root cause and answer the question addressing causal attribution. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while paying attention to actions as well as inactions, taking into account both necessary and sufficient causes. Consider if the cause is a result of a series of actions or if it can stand alone in causing the effect. Acknowledge the effects of intention behind actions or lack thereof in your deliberation. Reflect upon the necessity or sufficiency of the described conditions and assess the chain of events. In situations that warrant it, consider the complexity and nuances of the context, bearing in mind that the attribution of causality may differ based on situational specificity. Provide a comprehensive explanation in your answer, encapsulating your nuanced understanding of the situation rather than seeking to fit it into predetermined interpretations. At the conclusion of your response, place the chosen answer option within <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the given example, the language model's prompt contains too many details and steps. It could have confused the model and led it into evaluating irrelevant details, twisting its understanding of the presented situation. The ambiguity in the prompt could have made the language model to focus on the fact that Bob's actions caused harm, while the question specifically asked if Bob intentionally meant to harm the townspeople.

Breakdown of errors:

1. Problem of Interpretation: The prompt asks the model to assess influence and weight of each action which led to an overemphasis on Bob's action to rob the bank, however, the intention behind the action was overlooked. Therefore, the lengthy explanation of circumstance led the model off the path.

2. Attention to unnecessary details: The language model’s prompt is programmed to pay special attention to necessary and sufficient causes and sequences of events. This may have led the model to focus more on the detrimental effects and not enough on the intention behind the cause, which was the main point of the question.

3. Misinterpretation of Causation: Given that the prompt was designed to evaluate causation, the model may not have differentiated clearly between direct and indirect causation, thus wrongly attribute Bob's actions with an intent to harm the townspeople.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Simplify the instruction: The prompt can be simplified by reducing the steps and making it more focused on evaluating based on the asked question.

2. Clear Guidelines on Intent: Instead of asking the model to explicitly focus on necessary and sufficient causes or events, the model should be guided on how to evaluate the intention behind actions.

3. Direct vs Indirect Causation: The model should be guided to differentiate between direct and indirect causation. For instance, in this example, Bob's direct intention was to steal, and harm to townspeople was an indirect (and unintended on his part) result.

4. Emphasize model focus: The model should specifically be asked to address the main question at hand which was intentionality of Bob's actions rather than a broader analysis of situation context.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions related to the presented situation. Differentiate between necessary and sufficient conditions, and identify direct and indirect causation. Assess the influence and weight of each action or condition within the context of the situation. Reflect upon the roles and responsibilities of each person involved, considering their impact on the outcome. Contemplate if the observed effect could have transpired independently of the cause under consideration. Also, evaluate if the cause under discussion is the primary reason for an effect or just one among many conditions that had to be met for the effect to happen. Pay special attention to both necessary and sufficient causes, and assess the sequence of events. In situations where it's required, be mindful of the complexity and nuances of the context, understanding that causality attribution may differ based on specific situations. Compile a comprehensive explanation in your answer, showcasing a well-rounded understanding of the situation instead of forcing it into predetermined interpretations. To append your response, encapsulate your chosen answer within <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For the given example, the language model's prompt contains too many details and steps. It could have confused the model and led it into evaluating irrelevant details, twisting its understanding of the presented situation. The ambiguity in the prompt could have made the language model to focus on the fact that Bob's actions caused harm, while the question specifically asked if Bob intentionally meant to harm the townspeople.

Breakdown of errors:

1. Problem of Interpretation: The prompt asks the model to assess influence and weight of each action which led to an overemphasis on Bob's action to rob the bank, however, the intention behind the action was overlooked. Therefore, the lengthy explanation of circumstance led the model off the path.

2. Attention to unnecessary details: The language model’s prompt is programmed to pay special attention to necessary and sufficient causes and sequences of events. This may have led the model to focus more on the detrimental effects and not enough on the intention behind the cause, which was the main point of the question.

3. Misinterpretation of Causation: Given that the prompt was designed to evaluate causation, the model may not have differentiated clearly between direct and indirect causation, thus wrongly attribute Bob's actions with an intent to harm the townspeople.

Suggestions for improvement:

1. Simplify the instruction: The prompt can be simplified by reducing the steps and making it more focused on evaluating based on the asked question.

2. Clear Guidelines on Intent: Instead of asking the model to explicitly focus on necessary and sufficient causes or events, the model should be guided on how to evaluate the intention behind actions.

3. Direct vs Indirect Causation: The model should be guided to differentiate between direct and indirect causation. For instance, in this example, Bob's direct intention was to steal, and harm to townspeople was an indirect (and unintended on his part) result.

4. Emphasize model focus: The model should specifically be asked to address the main question at hand which was intentionality of Bob's actions rather than a broader analysis of situation context.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the chain of events and apply logical reasoning to determine the ultimate cause and answer the question about the attribution of causality. Pay close attention to all available rules, conditions and actions described in the situation when making your prediction. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation in your response.
(2) Consider all circumstances, actions, rules, and conditions described within the situation. Apply deductive reasoning to ascertain the root cause and respond to the question about causal attribution. In your answer, distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while also considering the effect of action versus inaction, and the intention behind the actions. If the situation demands, contemplate the complexity of the context and don't force-fit an answer, rather provide a nuanced explanation.
(3) Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions presented in the given situation. Use deductive reasoning to determine the root cause and answer the question addressing causal attribution. Distinguish between direct and indirect causation, while paying attention to actions as well as inactions, taking into account both necessary and sufficient causes. Consider if the cause is a result of a series of actions or if it can stand alone in causing the effect. Acknowledge the effects of intention behind actions or lack thereof in your deliberation. Reflect upon the necessity or sufficiency of the described conditions and assess the chain of events. In situations that warrant it, consider the complexity and nuances of the context, bearing in mind that the attribution of causality may differ based on situational specificity. Provide a comprehensive explanation in your answer, encapsulating your nuanced understanding of the situation rather than seeking to fit it into predetermined interpretations. At the conclusion of your response, place the chosen answer option within <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Analyze all circumstances, actions, inactions, rules, and conditions related to the presented situation.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
1. Did Wayne intentionally leave the device on the charging pad?
- Yes, Wayne intentionally left the device on the charging pad because he checked to see if it was on the pad and made the decision not to change its position. This was a deliberate action on his part. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

2. Did Wayne intentionally ensure that the device would be fully charged by not changing its position?
- No, Wayne did not intentionally ensure that the device would be fully charged by not changing its position. His primary motivation was to charge the device, and he simply followed the instructions provided. The outcome of the device being fully charged was a secondary consequence of his actions. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

The original question is: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting? The model answered incorrectly with option A, asserting that David's intentional act of changing the temperature setting causes his clothes dry in sixty minutes. 

However, the text states that "the clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH." Here, the drying time of the clothes relies on two independent conditions. Before David adjusts the temperature, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, which would alone lead to a sixty-minute drying time. The fact that David adjusted the temperature to HIGH doesn't have a causal effect on the drying time in this case. 

The prompt instructions, while complex and comprehensive, perhaps overemphasize the consideration of "intentional actions" and the "primary and secondary motivations of the individuals involved." This focus seems to lead the model to overstate the importance of David's deliberate action of changing the temperature in the cause-effect relationship, hence generating the wrong answer.

<2> 

The original question is: Is the device fully charged because Wayne didn't change the position of the device? The model answered incorrectly with option B, claiming that Wayne did not intentionally ensure the device would be fully charged by not changing its position.

However, based on the text, "the device will fully charge in one hour if it's either plugged in or on the charging pad," the device's charging state relies on two independent conditions. In this specific instance, Wayne's decision not to move the device results in it being fully charged because it was already placed rightly on the pad.

In this example, the model again appears to be led astray by the prompt's emphasis on considering "primary and secondary motivations of the individuals involved." This distracts from the basic causal relationship between Wayne not moving the device, and the device becoming fully charged. 

Improvements can be made to the prompt by:

1. Reducing the emphasis on primary and secondary motivations, which may lead to confusion when the intentionality of actions doesn't contribute to the cause-effect relationship. 

2. Encouraging the model to consider more carefully the basic conditionality of cause-effect relationships, and to examine whether actions or non-actions would have altered the outcome under the given conditions.

3. Prompting the model to consider both intentional and non-intentional action consequences.

4. Making the instructions less complex, which may currently be too abstract and confusing for the model. 

5. Inserting a sub-instruction that encourages the model to uphold logic in interpreting causal relationships. This would minimize instances where intentionality is overemphasized. 

6. Including a clause emphasizing the need to consider the independence or dependency of conditions leading to an outcome. The model should evaluate whether one action can result in the effect independently or if it’s an interplay of several actions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
1. How would a typical person answer the question "Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?"
- A typical person might say that the pharmacist's decision did cause the patient's recovery, as they signed off on the drug administration which ultimately led to the patient's recovery. However, they might also consider the attending doctor's decision to sign off despite the hospital policy as a contributing factor.

Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Indirect consequences: Jane's decision to disobey the official policy led to both her and Lauren logging on at the same time, causing the computer to crash. This action disrupted the workflow and potentially affected the productivity of both employees.

Intentional actions: Jane intentionally chose to log on to the computer at the same time as Lauren, despite knowing the official policy. Her primary motivation may have been to prioritize her own work over following the rules set by the company. However, her secondary motivation could have been to test the consequences of breaking the policy.

Therefore, a typical person would likely answer:
(B) No <answer></answer> - Jane's intentional decision to disobey the official policy and log on at the same time as Lauren directly led to the computer crashing.

A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog does not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
1. Did the hedgehog cause the polar bear to not finish his homework?
- Direct consequence: The hedgehog took the last pencil, leading to the polar bear not being able to finish his homework.
- Indirect consequence: The hedgehog's action of taking the last pencil indirectly caused the polar bear's inability to finish his homework.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B

gradient:
<1> 
Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Wrong Answer:  (A) Yes
Reason: The model seems to infer that because Bob was aware of the potential harmful consequences of his actions, his actions were intentional towards harming the townspeople. However, the context in prompt reveals that Bob's primary motivation was not to intentionally harm the townspeople but to get as much money as he could. Therefore, the damage to the townspeople's health was an indirect consequence of his action, not a direct result. 

<2> 
Question: Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Wrong Answer:  (A) Yes
Reason: The prompt leads the model to consider the pharmacist's decision as a direct cause of the patient's recovery, implying simple causation. However, the pharmacist only checked the availability of the drug and not its therapeutic value. Therefore, even though the pharmacist's decision was part of the sequence leading to the patient's recovery, it was not the direct cause of it.

<3> 
Question: Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Wrong Answer:  (B) No
Reason: The model appears to confuse the act of causing a direct outcome (the immediate crash of the computer due to simultaneous log-ins) with the surrounding indirect consequences (disruption of workflow). Despite this differentiation in the prompt, the model wrongly attributes the computer crashing to an indirect outcome of Jane's actions rather than seeing Jane's logging in contrary to the established rules as the direct cause of the crash.

<4> 
Question: Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Wrong Answer:  (A) Yes
Reason: The model fails to consider the context that the hedgehog wasn't aware of the rule about not taking pencils. Thus, despite causing the problem by taking the pencils (as in, removing the last pencil from the box), the causal attribution can't be held valid due to its lack of information about the rule.

Overall, the issues arise from:

- Overemphasis on direct consequences and not properly applying indirect consequences.
- Lack of focus on nuanced contexts surrounding the actor’s intentions.
- Misinterpretation of causal attributions for outcomes.
- Underestimating the importance and influence of primary and secondary motivations.
  
To improve the prompt, the model needs to:

- Clearly distinguish between the direct and indirect consequences of actions.
- Assign and analyze causal attribution in consideration of the individual's knowledge of their actions and potential outcomes.
- Take into account the primary and secondary motivations of the actors involved.
- Consider all aspects of the situation, including unwritten norms, rules, actor limitations, and less obvious concerns.
- Encourage closer analysis of the narrative for a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:

The question was about whether David's action of changing the temperature setting to HIGH caused the clothes to dry in 60 minutes. The model took into account direct and indirect consequences, and decided that David's actions led to the drying of the clothes in 60 minutes. However, the answer is incorrect because, regardless of the temperature setting, the clothes would still dry in 60 minutes because the cycle was set to MAX DRY. The model failed to clear distinguish between the conditions required for the clothes to dry in 60 minutes. 

For Example 2:

The question was about the causal relation between Wayne not changing the position of the device and the device being fully charged. The model considered Wayne's intentional action of not changing the position of the device and distinguished between his primary and secondary motivations. However, the model concluded incorrectly, that Wayne's inaction did not play a role in the device getting fully charged. In reality, Wayne's decision to not move the device from the charging pad contributed to its ability to fully charge. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answers:
1. Failure to differentiate the sufficient conditions: The prompt does not guide the language model to clearly differentiate between sufficient conditions for an effect to take place. It needs to consider that if any of the conditions could have independently led to the outcome, action or inaction on other conditions may not have a causal effect.
2. Misinterpretation of indirect consequences: The prompt could be leading the model to overcomplicate the indirect consequences in terms of motivations and nuances. This could result in the model coming to incorrect conclusions.

Recommendations for Improvement:

1. Add guidance concerning sufficient and necessary conditions. For example: "Consider whether the conditions involved in the scenario are necessary and sufficient for the outcome, and analyse the causal relationships accordingly."
2. Define clearer parameters around considering indirect consequences, especially concerning actions and their motivations. For example: "Look carefully at each action or inaction and its direct and indirect results. Consider whether the motivations and actions had significant contribution towards achieving the final outcome."
3. The prompt should guide the model to appreciate the context better. For instance: "Place actions and inactions within their wider context and distinguish between events that contribute centrally and those peripherally to the eventual outcome."

However, the answer is incorrect because, regardless of the temperature setting, the clothes would still dry in 60 minutes because the cycle was set to MAX DRY. The model failed to clear distinguish between the conditions required for the clothes to dry in 60 minutes. 

For Example 2:

The question was about the causal relation between Wayne not changing the position of the device and the device being fully charged. The model considered Wayne's intentional action of not changing the position of the device and distinguished between his primary and secondary motivations. However, the model concluded incorrectly, that Wayne's inaction did not play a role in the device getting fully charged. In reality, Wayne's decision to not move the device from the charging pad contributed to its ability to fully charge. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answers:
1. Failure to differentiate the sufficient conditions: The prompt does not guide the language model to clearly differentiate between sufficient conditions for an effect to take place. It needs to consider that if any of the conditions could have independently led to the outcome, action or inaction on other conditions may not have a causal effect.
2. Misinterpretation of indirect consequences: The prompt could be leading the model to overcomplicate the indirect consequences in terms of motivations and nuances. This could result in the model coming to incorrect conclusions.

Recommendations for Improvement:

1. Add guidance concerning sufficient and necessary conditions. For example: "Consider whether the conditions involved in the scenario are necessary and sufficient for the outcome, and analyse the causal relationships accordingly."
2. Define clearer parameters around considering indirect consequences, especially concerning actions and their motivations. For example: "Look carefully at each action or inaction and its direct and indirect results. Consider whether the motivations and actions had significant contribution towards achieving the final outcome."
3. The prompt should guide the model to appreciate the context better. For instance: "Place actions and inactions within their wider context and distinguish between events that contribute centrally and those peripherally to the eventual outcome."

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the direct consequence of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address was triggered by both Alice and Zoe being logged in at the same time, which violated the company's policy. While Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am initiated the chain of events, Alice's subsequent action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in directly led to the empty email being sent. Therefore, it can be argued that Alice's action indirectly caused the empty email to be sent.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The direct consequence of David changing the temperature setting to HIGH was that the dryer was able to dry his clothes within the specified time frame. The action of setting the temperature to HIGH directly influenced the outcome of the clothes drying in sixty minutes. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

gradient:
<1>
Analysis:
In the first situation, the language model incorrectly ascribes causation to Alice. There might be two possible reasons why the model did not correctly interpret this causal situation.

- First, the model fails to recognize that the formal operational rules (i.e., the specific time schedule of Alice and Zoe) are the key elements of this situation. Although technically, both Alice and Zoe's actions combined led to the anomalous email, according to the pre-established rules, Alice was not responsible as she followed the company's policy, while Zoe did not.

- Secondly, it seems the model might be weighing the last action (Alice's login) as more causative than the first (Zoe's login). The prompt should stress on the importance of sequence of events in interpreting causal situations.

<2>
Analysis:
In the second situation, the model incorrectly attributes the drying of David's clothes to him changing the setting to HIGH. 

- Here, the model did not take into account that the clothes would have dried in 60 minutes even if David hadn't changed the temperature because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. 
- The model did not consider the independent conditions leading to the outcome i.e., either of the settings (MAX DRY or HIGH temperature) were sufficient for the clothes to dry in 60 minutes. Therefore David's action of changing the temperature was redundant for the clothes drying in 60 minutes. 

Improvements:
Based on the analysis of these errors, here are key aspects to improve the prompt.

- The model needs explicit instructions to consider the established rules or guidelines in the scenario while assigning causation.
- The prompt should stress the importance of the sequence of events and conditional independencies in interpreting causal situations. 
- The prompt should explicitly instruct the model to consider whether an action or non-action results in the same outcome, essentially discerning between necessary and sufficient conditions. 
- The prompt also needs to make it clear that both the violating action and the one following the rule need to be assessed carefully under these circumstances.
- The model needs to be guided to discern between direct causes and indirect causes that were not essential to the outcome but just happened to be present.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer this question as follows:

No, the device is fully charged not because Wayne did not change the position of the device, but because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad. The device would have fully charged even if Wayne had changed the position of the device, as long as it remained plugged in and on the charging pad. Therefore, Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device did not directly cause the device to be fully charged.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first question, Bob's intent was to steal money, not to harm the townspeople. However, the harm to the townspeople was an indirect consequence of his actions. The model misinterpreted the question by focusing too much on the consequence (harm to the townspeople) and not enough on the individual's motivation. The model should also understand that although the action led to the harm, it was not Bob's primary objective. Consequently, the answer should be "No, Bob didn't intentionally harm the health of the townspeople." 

<2> 
In the second question, Wayne's absence of an action, which is not changing the position of the device, contributed to the device being fully charged. The model missed this indirect contribution to the outcome. The model mistakenly assumed that because the device would still charge if Wayne had moved it (as long as it remained on the pad and plugged in), Wayne's inaction did not contribute to it being charged. It did not take into account that by not moving the device, Wayne ensured that the necessary conditions for charging remained intact.

Based on these two examples, the prompt could be improved in the following aspects:
1. Make it clear that the model should differentiate between the direct consequences of an action (or non-action) and the individual's actual intentions. The model needs not to solely focus on the result but also consider intention.
2. Remind the model to consider both actions and non-actions (inaction). An action, or lack of one, can both result in a particular outcome.
3. Emphasize the importance of examining the nuances within the context when assessing the causal attribution. The nuances here could include the state of affairs before and after the incident, the individual's stated goals, and the possible outcomes of different scenarios (including taking actions differently or inaction).
4. Reinforce the need for the model to analyze whether a condition has a dependent relationship or an independent relationship with the outcome, which directly affects the cause-and-effect relationship. It's important that the model doesn't simply equate an action's outcome with the intention behind the action.

However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Respond to questions related to causal attribution while focusing on direct and indirect consequences. In your answer, understand the role of both intentional and non-intentional actions, considering the context, nuances, and the individuals' motivations involved. Make sure to acknowledge whether conditions leading to an outcome are dependent or independent of each other and uphold logical interpretation of cause-effect relationships. Objectively assess the impact of an action or non-action on the outcome under the given circumstances.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer this question as follows:

No, the device is fully charged not because Wayne did not change the position of the device, but because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad. The device would have fully charged even if Wayne had changed the position of the device, as long as it remained plugged in and on the charging pad. Therefore, Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device did not directly cause the device to be fully charged.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the first question, Bob's intent was to steal money, not to harm the townspeople. However, the harm to the townspeople was an indirect consequence of his actions. The model misinterpreted the question by focusing too much on the consequence (harm to the townspeople) and not enough on the individual's motivation. The model should also understand that although the action led to the harm, it was not Bob's primary objective. Consequently, the answer should be "No, Bob didn't intentionally harm the health of the townspeople." 

<2> 
In the second question, Wayne's absence of an action, which is not changing the position of the device, contributed to the device being fully charged. The model missed this indirect contribution to the outcome. The model mistakenly assumed that because the device would still charge if Wayne had moved it (as long as it remained on the pad and plugged in), Wayne's inaction did not contribute to it being charged. It did not take into account that by not moving the device, Wayne ensured that the necessary conditions for charging remained intact.

Based on these two examples, the prompt could be improved in the following aspects:
1. Make it clear that the model should differentiate between the direct consequences of an action (or non-action) and the individual's actual intentions. The model needs not to solely focus on the result but also consider intention.
2. Remind the model to consider both actions and non-actions (inaction). An action, or lack of one, can both result in a particular outcome.
3. Emphasize the importance of examining the nuances within the context when assessing the causal attribution. The nuances here could include the state of affairs before and after the incident, the individual's stated goals, and the possible outcomes of different scenarios (including taking actions differently or inaction).
4. Reinforce the need for the model to analyze whether a condition has a dependent relationship or an independent relationship with the outcome, which directly affects the cause-and-effect relationship. It's important that the model doesn't simply equate an action's outcome with the intention behind the action.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain.

However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Wrong Answer: Bob did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. (A) <A>Yes</A>

Reason: The model probably made this prediction based on the result of the overall action taken by Bob, which led to the townspeople being severely ill. However, in the context provided, it was explicitly stated that Bob acted without regard for the health of the townspeople, focusing on the robbery instead. His intention was not to harm the health of the townspeople but to rob the bank and accumulate wealth. The subsequent health effects were an indirect consequence, not a direct intention. 

The model thus seems to misunderstand the distinction between direct intention (where an action is deliberately performed with an intended outcome) and a consequence that occurs as a side effect of achieving a primary objective. This could be due to the complexity and layered nature of the prompt, which demands both a deep understanding of causal attribution and an ability to acknowledge whether conditions leading to an outcome are dependent or independent of each other.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Ensure Clarification on Intention versus Consequence: The model needs to better understand the distinction between intention and consequences. While a consequence happened as a result of Bob's action, the illness of the townspeople was not Bob's direct intention. This suggests a need to explicitly specify in the prompt that the model should differentiate between the intentional, direct aims of an action and the subsequent, indirect consequences that follow it.

2. Emphasize Nuance in Understanding: The prompt should incorporate a request to the model to pay close attention to the verbal cues provided in the input's narrative. Words like "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can." provides crucial information about the actors' intentions in the scenario.

3. Simplify the Task Description: The prompt is currently quite complex and layered. It could benefit from being simplified or broken down into smaller parts to make it more accessible to the model. 

4. Improve Instruction Clarity: The model is asked to "uphold logical interpretation of cause-effect relationships." The wording of this instruction may be misconstrued by the model and it can benefit from a more explicit instruction such as "evaluate the direct versus indirect cause-effect relationships and assess intent versus consequence." 

5. Increase Focus on Context: Although the prompt encourages the model to consider context, the large scale of the task might cause the essential contextual elements to be overlooked. Strengthening this aspect of the instruction could help.

6. Provide Examples: The prompt could benefit from including an example that makes the distinction between direct and indirect consequences and intentional and unintentional actions for better clarity.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes.

David's action was inconsequential as the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes even without his intervention. This indicates that the model did not accurately analyze or understand the cause-and-effect relationship mentioned within the scenario.

Overall, the issues seem to arise from:
1. Lack of clarity on how to structure the response properly. 
2. Not considering all necessary factors in assessing the attribution of causality. 
3. Not properly applying logic in understanding cause-and-effect relationships, especially when those relationships are conditional.

To improve the prompt based on the detected issues:

1. Specify a clearer structure: Provide guidelines on how the responses should be structured which includes in this case to show the answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
2. Emphasize conditional relationships: Ensure that the model knows to pay attention to if-then or either-or conditional statements in the scenario, as they often hold the key to properly attributing causality. 
3. Strengthen logical analysis instruction: Advise the model to thoroughly analyze the logical relationships and not overly focus on intentional actions.
4. Instill nuance: In certain cases, changing a condition may not have any effect on the outcome. The model should be trained to differentiate between situations where an intentional action caused an outcome and where an outcome occurred despite an action.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions concerning the attribution of causality. In your responses, discuss both immediate and remote consequences. Distinguish between intentional actions and inadvertent occurrences. Pay close attention to the context provided, along with the nuances of the situation, and the primary motivators of the individuals involved. Understand whether the conditions leading to the outcome are interrelated or unrelated and analyze the cause-and-effect relationships logically. Analyze both the action or inaction's direct and indirect impacts on the results, focusing on the actor's explicit intentions versus the unintended outcomes of the action. Recognize that an action may have unintended consequences and that these may not be the product of intent. Use the context, words, and actions of the individuals in the narrative, to accurately assess intent and responsibility.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. By setting the temperature to HIGH, David directly influenced the drying time of his clothes, as indicated by the conditions set for the dryer to dry the clothes in sixty minutes. Therefore, his intentional action had a direct and immediate impact on the outcome.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the first example, the prompt guide has led to a formatting error where the model is providing the answer in an improper format. The prompt has been designed to provide extensive and detailed analysis of the scenario provided, but it forgot to instruct the model on the proper manner of displaying the answer. This problem may also stem from ambiguity in the prompt’s structure.

David's action was inconsequential as the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes even without his intervention. This indicates that the model did not accurately analyze or understand the cause-and-effect relationship mentioned within the scenario.

Overall, the issues seem to arise from:
1. Lack of clarity on how to structure the response properly. 
2. Not considering all necessary factors in assessing the attribution of causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

In the case of Wayne and his high-tech watch, the model seems to be misinterpreting the cause-and-effect relationship, incorrectly assigning direct causation to the charging conditions (being plugged in and on the charging pad) rather than Wayne's inaction (not moving the device off the charging pad). Despite the explicit prompt instruction to pay attention to both action and inaction, the model fails to recognize that Wayne's inaction is crucial to maintaining the charging conditions, and thus, is a direct cause that leads to the device being fully charged. 

Example 2:

For the question about Bob the henchman, the language model seems to oversimplify the notion of intent, failing to differentiate between Bob's primary motivator (to steal money) and the indirect consequences of his actions (the townspeople becoming severely ill). It overlooks the fact that Bob explicitly states he has no feelings whatsoever for the health of the townspeople, and he shows indifference, not intent, towards their health situation. Any harm to the townspeople is an unintended consequence of Bob's main objective. 

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Emphasize the importance of separating direct primary motivations from indirect consequences.
2. Make sure the modeled language is clear, direct, and unambiguous when dissecting intent versus actual outcome.
3. Stress the relevance of actors' explicit intentions or spoken words and their ultimate impact on the causal analysis, especially how these manifest in action or inaction.
4. Add instructions to analyze the actor's explicit intents and primary motivation before determining any action as intentional or inadvertent.
5. Prompt the model to consider a 'systematic approach' when establishing the attribution of causality, giving a step-by-step analysis to better structure its logic and giving a more accurate understanding of cause-and-effect relationships.
6. Encourage to focus on 'direct causes' first (like Wayne's inaction of keeping the watch on the charging pad) before delving into peripheral conditions that might affect the outcome.
7. Request the model to acknowledge and dissect any stated indifference by a character to certain consequences of their actions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

Step by Step Analysis:
The problem assesses that David's clothes would dry in sixty minutes if either the 'MAX DRY' cycle or HIGH temperature is set. Even without David's action of changing the temperature settings, the outcome would have been the same. Because of that, the language model should have acknowledged David's action didn't necessarily cause the outcome. 

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
The language model focused significantly on David's active intent and didn't differentiate between the unintended occurrences and intentional actions effectively. It did not consider the existing 'MAX DRY' cycle, which would still have dried the clothes in sixty minutes.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:

Step by Step Analysis:
Alice logging in at 9:30 am doesn't cause the email to be sent, given the action that triggers it already happened when Alice logged in (Zoe's unauthorised log-in in the morning). 

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
The model failed to acknowledge the sequential cause-and-effect relationship. It primarily focused on Alice’s action, which was consistent with the company’s official policy, as the primary cause of the email generation. The language model did not stress the chronological sequence of unauthorized access by Zoe which was the initial trigger.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Focus on chronological order of events while answering causality questions, as sometimes the first event triggers ensuing series of events. 
2. Distinguish between unnecessary and necessary conditions to attain a specific outcome.
3. Focus on analysing the primary cause of a consequence, even if later actions appear to contribute to the outcome.
4. Emphasise the understanding of existing conditions before the occurrence of a certain event.
5. Prioritize examining pre-established conditions or rules that influence the outcome of a situation.
6. Expand on analysing the persuasive points in a narrative, such as nuances in policies or rules, which can also manipulate the course of events or behaviors.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

<1> 

1. The question: "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?" is complex and multi-layered. The model's answer "Yes" is incorrect, as B is the correct answer, which means Bob did not intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. The reason for the confusion seems to lie in the setup of the story and how intentionality was signaled from the character.

2. In the given narrative, Bob's intention is stated clearly: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can." This indicates that his primary motive is acquiring the money. He has an awareness of the potential harm but is indifferent to it; he didn't take the action with the explicit intention of causing the harm. However, the model treating it as intentionality may be due to the lack of finer nuanced distinctions in understanding the difference between knowledge of potential harm and intention to cause that harm. 

3. The prompt asks the model to consider all facts provided in the narrative, understand the commitments and intentions of the actors, and distinguish actions undertaken knowingly and actions that happen without such knowledge. But the model may not have accurately executed these instructions, especially the distinction between the main intention and secondary unintended effects. 

Based on these reasons:

- The prompt needs more clarity in the explanations needed for understanding and categorizing an action as intentional or not.
- It could also provide clear guidelines for considering primary and secondary effects separately for judgment of responsibility. The model should answer based on the primary intent, not the secondary harm.
- The prompt could also benefit from explaining that harm caused knowingly but not intended should not be treated as intentionally inflicted.
- The prompt could use examples of different scenarios to train the model better in discerning nuanced differences. 

These changes should enhance the accuracy of the model's responses to complex multi-layered questions about causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. (A) <A>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

1. The question: "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?" is complex and multi-layered. The model's answer "Yes" is incorrect, as B is the correct answer, which means Bob did not intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. The reason for the confusion seems to lie in the setup of the story and how intentionality was signaled from the character.

2. In the given narrative, Bob's intention is stated clearly: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can." This indicates that his primary motive is acquiring the money. He has an awareness of the potential harm but is indifferent to it; he didn't take the action with the explicit intention of causing the harm. However, the model treating it as intentionality may be due to the lack of finer nuanced distinctions in understanding the difference between knowledge of potential harm and intention to cause that harm.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

gradient:
<1> 

The wrong answer given by the language model for this question suggests a misunderstanding or oversimplification of the causality prompt. Let's analyze where the mistakes have happened:

Question analysis: The scenario describes David's dryer that would dry his clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set at MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. The cycle was already set at MAX DRY, but David changed the temperature to HIGH anyway, despite the scenario making it clear that either setting alone is sufficient for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes.

Model’s Answer Analysis: The model selected (A) suggesting that David’s actions in changing the temperature setting to HIGH caused the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. However, considering the information given, David's clothes would have dried in the same amount of time even if he had not changed the temperature setting, since the dryer was already set to MAX DRY. The process of drying was already assured before David made any changes. So, his action in setting the temperature to HIGH did not cause the effect (clothes drying in 60 minutes), but it merely happened concurrently with it.

Reasons for Wrong Answer: 
1. Misinterpretation of causality: The model seems to confuse correlation with causation. It assumes that because David made a change and an expected result occurred, the change must have caused the result.
2. Missed critical information: The model seemed to overlook or misinterpret the crucial information that "the cycle is set to MAX DRY", which would result in the clothes drying in sixty minutes, regardless of any other changes.

Aspects to improve the prompt: 
1. Emphasize the understanding of causal relationships: The prompt should stress the need to differentiate between actions that happen concurrently with an event and actions that actually cause the event.
2. Stress on fact-checking: The prompt should insist on checking all facts given in the question and understanding their implications before making a determination on causality.
3. Enhance comprehension of complex scenarios: The prompt should explicitly request for careful consideration of complex scenarios where multiple conditions can lead to the same outcome, and the need to discern the true causal factors.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

gradient:
Example 1:

In this question, the model provided the wrong response because the prompt might have pushed the model to assign either Alice or Zoe as the cause of the email being sent. The model failed to consider who violated the policy in the given scenario, i.e., Zoe. A better understanding of "policy violation" and its causal attribution was needed. The model answers that Alice was the cause due to her actions of logging in. However, the fact that Alice was adhering to the policy and should not be held liable overrides this.

The model placed too much emphasis on the direct cause (Alice logging in) and less on the context (Zoe violating policy). Also, the prompt seems to lead the model's interpretation leaning more towards the immediate observable cause, a.k.a Alice logging in, which resulted in the email being sent. It did not focus adequately on spotting the behavioral violation committed by Zoe, which was the root cause of the final consequence.

The prompt may not have provided enough instruction for the model to consider stakeholders' rules or policy guidelines adequately when thinking about actions and consequences. Alice's login was an effect of Zoe's early login, without which there would be no cause for the email.

To improve the prompt,

1. The prompt needs a clearer explanation to give more weight to the context, including policy rules, behavioral norms, or rule violation, and the actors involved.
2. You could instruct the model to look for any non-compliance or deviance from norms or rules while examining causality.
3. The prompt could emphasize evaluating the roles of stakeholders in order not to penalise individuals who are adhering to rules and regulations.
4. The model could be prompted to identify the actions that led to the policy being violated, causing the issue rather than simply identifying the immediate apparent actions leading to the consequence.

In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Alice did cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. By logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in, Alice directly triggered the system to send the empty email. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

In this question, the model provided the wrong response because the prompt might have pushed the model to assign either Alice or Zoe as the cause of the email being sent. The model failed to consider who violated the policy in the given scenario, i.e., Zoe. A better understanding of "policy violation" and its causal attribution was needed. The model answers that Alice was the cause due to her actions of logging in. However, the fact that Alice was adhering to the policy and should not be held liable overrides this.

The model placed too much emphasis on the direct cause (Alice logging in) and less on the context (Zoe violating policy). Also, the prompt seems to lead the model's interpretation leaning more towards the immediate observable cause, a.k.a Alice logging in, which resulted in the email being sent. It did not focus adequately on spotting the behavioral violation committed by Zoe, which was the root cause of the final consequence.

The prompt may not have provided enough instruction for the model to consider stakeholders' rules or policy guidelines adequately when thinking about actions and consequences. Alice's login was an effect of Zoe's early login, without which there would be no cause for the email.

To improve the prompt,

1. The prompt needs a clearer explanation to give more weight to the context, including policy rules, behavioral norms, or rule violation, and the actors involved.
2. You could instruct the model to look for any non-compliance or deviance from norms or rules while examining causality.
3. The prompt could emphasize evaluating the roles of stakeholders in order not to penalise individuals who are adhering to rules and regulations.
4. The model could be prompted to identify the actions that led to the policy being violated, causing the issue rather than simply identifying the immediate apparent actions leading to the consequence.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers to questions, considering both direct and indirect consequences, related to causal attribution. In your responses, distinguish between intentional actions quite clearly, considering the context, nuances, primary and secondary motivations of the individuals involved.
(2) When addressing the following questions about causality, take into account both the direct and indirect effects of the actions described. Make a clear distinction between actions that are knowingly undertaken with an understanding of their potential consequences, and those that happen without such knowledge. Apportion causal attribution prudently based on not only the immediate actions and consequences but also the broader context, including the actors' primary and secondary intentions, their understanding of norms or rules, their constraints, and any nuances in their motivations or the situation. Evaluate comprehensively all facts provided in the narrative to avoid oversimplified interpretations and to provide a detailed, well-rounded response to each scenario.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> When addressing the provided scenarios about causality, pay close attention to the direct and indirect effects of every action described. Clearly differentiate between actions that are knowingly undertaken with an awareness of potential consequences, and those that occur without such knowledge. Assign causality carefully, taking into account not only the immediate actions and their outcomes, but also the wider context. This context should include the actors' primary and secondary objectives, their understanding of any existing norms or rules, their possible restraints, and subtle aspects of their motivations or their environment. Particularly prioritize any aspects of breach or adherence to norms or rules as potential pivotal points in your causal analysis. Evaluate all available information in a comprehensive manner to eschew oversimplified interpretations and ensure a detailed, nuanced response to each scenario. Don’t penalise individuals who followed rules, but rather seek to identify actions that led to any rule violation and subsequently caused the issue at hand. Your objective is to provide a comprehensive narrative of causality, which might involve multiple actors and layered effects. <END>

   prompt: In the presented scenario, dissect the chain of events leading to the final upshot. Execute a wide-ranging assessment of all stipulations, undertakings, and consequences, paying meticulous attention to the primary objective underlying any action or non-action, not just the consequential result.

Probe into situations where multiple root causes could coincide at once, or instances where the end would have emerged even without the implicated act. Reflect on whether the actions or omissions were critical to the final outcome and if several actions critically impacted the result. Recall that an action occurring synchronously with an outcome doesn't inherently indicate direct causation whereas an outcome could materialize absent a particular action. Moreover, bear in mind that intention does not necessarily equate to the initial or primary objective, but also includes foreseeable consequences. Explore each case, focusing on unraveling the inherent motives, the plausible presence of diverse causes, and the remote results of actions or the lack thereof.

   prompt: In the given scenario, examine the sequence of events leading to the final result. Carry out a comprehensive evaluation of all provisions, actions, and results, putting scrupulous emphasis on the primary purpose of any action or inaction, not just focusing on their eventual outcomes. Retain the concept of 'direct cause' as an act or absence of it, which, if not done, would have altered the outcome. Consider situations where more than one primary cause could occur at the same time, or instances where the result would have ensued without the mentioned action or inaction. Reflect upon whether the mentioned actions or inactions were critical in shaping the final outcome and whether multiple actions or inactions had significant influences. Remember that actions occurring synchronously with an outcome do not imply direct causation automatically, while an outcome could happen even without certain actions. Remember that intention can include actions, non-actions, and foreseeable consequences, and might not always be equal to the primary objective. Investigate each case, aiming to decipher the fundamental motives, the probable existence of multiple causes, and the indirect effects of actions or their absence. Gauge whether the provided statement is a direct, probable cause of the final outcome and select one of the presented alternate options.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the scenario given and determine the relevant cause or causes that led to the final outcome. While evaluating all conditions, actions, and inactions, avoid biases towards active or passive causation. Ensure equal consideration even if the cause was derived from maintaining the status quo, as inaction can also lead to outcomes. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or no action occurred, which, if avoided, would change the final result. Consider if there were multiple factors at play that concurrently led to the outcome. Pay close attention to situations where the consequence would have happened regardless of the performance or absence of the action in question. In your analysis, also consider scenarios where the underlying intentions of actions or inactions may or may not directly influence the outcome. Treat intention-driven and unintentional circumstances equally while assessing the causal relations. An action occurring at the same time as an outcome doesn't automatically imply causation and likewise, the lack of an action doesn't rule out the possibility of that outcome. Evaluate each case and determine whether the ensuing statement is a direct or indirect cause of the outcome. Choose your answer from the provided options.

   prompt: Consider the scenario outlined, and determine the direct cause of the final event. A direct cause is an action that is necessary for the outcome to occur—the outcome cannot happen without this action. Remember, there may be situations of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously, or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action. Multiple actions can also play crucial roles in the result. Intention also matters; an action may lead to an outcome, but if the outcome was not the intent of the action, it's important to note that. Recognize that just because events occur together does not necessarily make one the cause of the other. Similarly, an action not occurring doesn't always imply the outcome would have been different. Analyze whether the specific changes or actions were essential for the final outcome based on their intent, necessity, and weight in bringing about the result, and whether the sequence of events and timing of actions played a role in causing the outcome. For each case, determine whether the proposed action is a direct and intentional cause of the outcome by making your selection from the provided options.

   prompt: In evaluating the following questions about causality, please ensure to delve deeply into the direct and indirect impacts of each action described. Clearly delineate between actions that are intentionally performed with comprehension of their potential effects, and those that occur without that awareness. Allocate causality prudently, considering not only the immediate actions and their visible consequences but also the broader context where these actions take place. This includes accounting for the primary and secondary intentions of actors involved, their understanding or lack thereof, of any relevant norms or rules, any constraints they may have, and the subtleties in their motives or the specific circumstances. Further, avoid construing causality based on simple correlation between actions and outcomes. Rigorously check all given facts against the results with a keen eye for detail, and remember that events might occur concurrently without one causing the other. In complex scenarios where multiple factors could independently lead to the same result, carefully deduce the true causal agents. The objective is to contemplate all dimensions of the problem to circumvent oversimplified or misinterpreted conclusions, and to provide a nuanced, cogent response to each causality question provided.

   prompt: In the scenario described, ascertain the pertinent cause or causes leading to the final outcome. Conduct a thorough analysis of all conditions, actions, and results with particular emphasis on the principal intention behind an action or inaction, rather than just the subsequent outcome. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or the lack thereof, which if not taken, the outcome wouldn't have eventuated. Consider instances where multiple direct causes might transpire simultaneously, or situations where the outcome would have unfolded even without the action in question. Contemplate whether the actions or non-actions were integral for the final outcome and if multiple actions contributed significantly to the result. Remember, an action transpiring together with an outcome does not necessarily signify direct causation, while the absence of an action could still result in the given outcome. Evaluate each case, placing emphasis on discerning the underlying intentions, the possible coexistence of multiple causes, and the indirect results of actions or their absence. Determine whether the given statement is a direct, intentional cause of the outcome and choose one of the given options.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the given scenario and determine the ultimate cause that leads to the final outcome. Evaluate all possible conditions, actions, and results meticulously. Understand that a 'direct cause' is a condition or an action without which the final outcome would not have been possible. It's essential to note that there can be scenarios where multiple direct causes could be occurring at the same time, or the outcome may have happened without a particular action taking place. Ensure to contemplate whether the changes or actions taken were vital to the end outcome and whether multiple actions played a significant contribution to the result. It's worth noting that an action happening along with an outcome doesn't automatically mean it's a direct cause - same goes for a lack of action. For a given scenario, you need to decide if the suggested proposition is a direct cause of the outcome by selecting from the given options. Direct cause should not be confused with a mere cause which although can influence the outcome, is not indispensable for it to occur. Provide instances where an action is not necessary for the outcome to occur, it does not establish a direct cause relationship. Carefully identify such scenarios to avoid attributing unnecessary actions to the final result. Similarly, multiple simultaneous actions may not necessarily imply multiple direct causes.

   prompt: Consider the scenario outlined, and determine the direct cause of the final event. A direct cause is an action that is necessary for the outcome to occur—the outcome cannot happen without this action. Remember, there may be situations of multiple direct causes happening simultaneously, or conditions where the outcome would have occurred even without the action. Multiple actions can also play crucial roles in the result. Intention also matters; an action may lead to an outcome, but if the outcome was not the intent of the action, it's important to note that. Recognize that just because events occur together does not necessarily make one the cause of the other. Similarly, an action not occurring doesn't always imply the outcome would have been different. Analyze whether the specific changes or actions were essential for the final outcome based on their intent, necessity, and weight in bringing about the result, and whether the sequence of events and timing of actions played a role in causing the outcome. For each case, determine whether the proposed action is a direct and intentional cause of the outcome by making your selection from the provided options.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the scenario given and determine the relevant cause or causes that led to the final outcome. While evaluating all conditions, actions, and inactions, avoid biases towards active or passive causation. Ensure equal consideration even if the cause was derived from maintaining the status quo, as inaction can also lead to outcomes. Keep in mind that a direct cause implies an action or no action occurred, which, if avoided, would change the final result. Consider if there were multiple factors at play that concurrently led to the outcome. Pay close attention to situations where the consequence would have happened regardless of the performance or absence of the action in question. In your analysis, also consider scenarios where the underlying intentions of actions or inactions may or may not directly influence the outcome. Treat intention-driven and unintentional circumstances equally while assessing the causal relations. An action occurring at the same time as an outcome doesn't automatically imply causation and likewise, the lack of an action doesn't rule out the possibility of that outcome. Evaluate each case and determine whether the ensuing statement is a direct or indirect cause of the outcome. Choose your answer from the provided options.

   prompt: In the given scenario, identify the action or actions that directly led to the stated outcome. Use careful reasoning to evaluate all conditions, actions, results and their interactions. Remember, a direct cause is defined as an event without which the specified outcome wouldn't have occurred. Consider whether there are multiple causes acting simultaneously or if the outcome could have still transpired without the said action. Evaluate whether the actions or lack of them were critical to the described outcome and if multiple actions significantly contributed. Keep in mind, the mere co-occurrence of an action with an outcome does not denote direct causation, and the absence of an action doesn't necessarily prevent the outcome. As you critique each instance, discern the primary intent behind the actions or inactions and weigh the potential occurrence of multiple causes. Separate incidental consequences from direct causes. Finally, determine the nature of the given statement: whether it is a direct cause or a secondary effect of the outcome, and their intentionality.

Probe into situations where multiple root causes could coincide at once, or instances where the end would have emerged even without the implicated act. Reflect on whether the actions or omissions were critical to the final outcome and if several actions critically impacted the result. Recall that an action occurring synchronously with an outcome doesn't inherently indicate direct causation whereas an outcome could materialize absent a particular action. Moreover, bear in mind that intention does not necessarily equate to the initial or primary objective, but also includes foreseeable consequences. Explore each case, focusing on unraveling the inherent motives, the plausible presence of diverse causes, and the remote results of actions or the lack thereof.

The act of attributing causality requires judiciousness; you need to look beyond the immediate actions and consequences to the wider context, taking into account not just the actors' primary objectives, but also their secondary intentions, adherence to norms or rules, constraints, and any subtle aspects of their motivations or the situation. When evaluating an action's intentionality, the priority should rest with the actor's primary intentions over the secondary effects. A harm that's a known but unintended byproduct of an action must not be treated as a deliberately inflicted harm. Please carefully analyze all the facts provided in the narrative to refrain from drawing oversimplified interpretations, thereby ensuring you provide thoughtful, comprehensive and nuanced responses to each scenario.

   prompt: In evaluating the following questions about causality, please ensure to delve deeply into the direct and indirect impacts of each action described. Clearly delineate between actions that are intentionally performed with comprehension of their potential effects, and those that occur without that awareness. Allocate causality prudently, considering not only the immediate actions and their visible consequences but also the broader context where these actions take place. This includes accounting for the primary and secondary intentions of actors involved, their understanding or lack thereof, of any relevant norms or rules, any constraints they may have, and the subtleties in their motives or the specific circumstances. Further, avoid construing causality based on simple correlation between actions and outcomes. Rigorously check all given facts against the results with a keen eye for detail, and remember that events might occur concurrently without one causing the other. In complex scenarios where multiple factors could independently lead to the same result, carefully deduce the true causal agents. The objective is to contemplate all dimensions of the problem to circumvent oversimplified or misinterpreted conclusions, and to provide a nuanced, cogent response to each causality question provided.

   prompt: When addressing the provided scenarios about causality, pay close attention to the direct and indirect effects of every action described. Clearly differentiate between actions that are knowingly undertaken with an awareness of potential consequences, and those that occur without such knowledge. Assign causality carefully, taking into account not only the immediate actions and their outcomes, but also the wider context. This context should include the actors' primary and secondary objectives, their understanding of any existing norms or rules, their possible restraints, and subtle aspects of their motivations or their environment. Particularly prioritize any aspects of breach or adherence to norms or rules as potential pivotal points in your causal analysis. Evaluate all available information in a comprehensive manner to eschew oversimplified interpretations and ensure a detailed, nuanced response to each scenario. Don’t penalise individuals who followed rules, but rather seek to identify actions that led to any rule violation and subsequently caused the issue at hand. Your objective is to provide a comprehensive narrative of causality, which might involve multiple actors and layered effects.
