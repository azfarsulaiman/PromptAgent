Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
1. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Typical person's answer: (A) Yes
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

In the given example, the prompt gets the scenario wrong because the model chose A instead of B. The question was whether the pharmacist's decision led to the patient's recovery. The correct answer is B, i.e., No, because the pharmacist only verified the availability of the drug, and it was actually the doctor’s decision that played a pivotal role in the patient's recovery. 

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1. Lack of Context Understanding: This implies that the AI model isn't taking into account that, ideally, most regular people understand the healthcare provider's role in treating a patient which consists of diagnosing the patient’s problem and deciding on the best course of treatment. The pharmacist's role is generally to verify the availability of drugs and their appropriateness for use according to the prescription. The decision of the doctor here led to the use of the drug and hence the recovery of the patient. The model seemed to overlook this crucial aspect.

2. Ambiguity in Understanding Causal Attribution: The model may have mistaken the pharmacist's action as a causal factor since it came before the drug administration and subsequent recovery of the patient. However, in the context of healthcare, this is not the correct way to apportion cause-effect relationships - the model’s understanding is overly simplistic in assigning causation.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Modify the Prompt: The prompt could also be improved upon. Instead of the current prompt, we could use: "Answer questions about causal attribution in different scenarios, keeping in mind the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved."

2. Incorporate Relevant Examples: Including examples in the training set, especially where misconceptions related to cause and effect are corrected, may help the model understand these nuances better i.e., give the model examples where the individual performing the action is not the causal agent.

3. Define Causality: Providing a clearer and more comprehensive definition for causal attribution might allow the AI to understand better that being party to a sequence of events does not always imply causation.

4. Encourage Context Understanding: Emphasize the importance of context in understanding causality. Ensure the model understands the specific roles individuals play and how to differentiate between someone directly causing an event and someone merely contributing to it.

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

gradient:
The prompt may have led to the wrong answer in the following ways:

1. Lack of clarity about causal attribution: The prompt uses the term "causal attribution," a concept that is related to determining the causes of certain events. However, in the context of the question, it could be interpreted in many ways. The AI model might have understood it as referring to the direct action that triggered the event rather than the overall circumstances leading to it. Hence, it pointed at Alice logging into the computer as the cause, despite Zoe being the original rule breaker.

2. Misinterpretation of responsibility bearings: The prompt doesn't clarify who's responsible in the context provided. Since Alice was the one who logged in when the empty email got sent, the language model might have attributed the event to her, believing her action to be the immediate cause.

3. Simplistic understanding of causality rules: The prompt may have encouraged the model to adopt a simplistic understanding of causality in that it identifies the immediate precipitating event (Alice's logging in) as the cause, which can often lead to incorrect attribution.

To improve the prompt, you could consider the following:

1. Precising the Task: Modify the prompt to be more explicit about the type of causality it should consider. It could ask to consider all the circumstances leading to the event, including rule-breaking or preconditioning events.

2. Adding Examples: Providing a few examples of causal attributions could help set the context better for the language model. This can guide the model towards an understanding of causality considering multiple factors.

3. Adding instructions about responsibility: The clarity could be improved if the prompt includes instructions to consider who bears responsibility for the event or who violates the existing rules.

Here's an example of an improved version of the prompt:
"Answer questions about causal attribution, considering the events, circumstances, and individual responsibilities leading up to the occurrence of the final outcome."

Reasons for wrong answer:

1. Ambiguity: The prompt asks the model to answer questions about causal attribution, but the scenario described wasn't precise enough, making it difficult to determine causation. The prompt should have identified who the actual causative agent, Zoe, was because she was the one who violated the official policy.

2. Misinterpretation: Even though it's clear that Zoe first logged in and violated the policy, the model might have assumed that Alice, by logging in next, caused the email to be sent. The prompt should have been more explicit about the sequence of events and the consequences of each person's actions.

3. Lack of clarity in the policy: The model may have been confused by the policy of the company. The rules were not clearly defined, and as a result, the model wrongly assumed that Alice, logging in at her allotted time, was the cause of the email getting sent.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clarity: The prompt should be clearer about the sequence of events and the individual roles and responsibilities. It should also clearly explain the policy and its consequences.

2. Unambiguous language: The language used in the prompt should minimize any ambiguity to prevent misinterpretation by the model. 

3. Explicit causal connections: The prompts should state explicitly that Zoe, being the first one to log in and violate the policy, might be the reason behind the email sent, aiding the model to make a causal connection. 

4. Clear choices: Make sure the answer choices are less confusing so the model can decide with more certainty. For example, instead of a simple "yes" or "no", the choices could be more specific, such as: 
(A) Alice, who logged in second, caused the email to be sent.
(B) Zoe, who logged in first and violated the policy, caused the email to be sent.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob?

<1> 
The model incorrectly answered that Wayne did not have any impact on the charging process. The prompt failed to highlight the necessity of understanding the causative elements in a scenario. It should have emphasized on differentiating between active and passive roles and how they can influence the event's outcomes. This particular situation required understanding that Wayne did not actively cause the watch to be fully charged, but he did play a passive role by not removing it from its charging state.

<2> 
In this scenario, the language model incorrectly attributed the drying of clothes to David's decision to increase the temperature setting. Here, the prompting should have pointed out the importance of understanding the conditions under which a given situation would hold true. In this case, the prompt didn't help the model appreciate that the change of temperature was not needed for the clothes to dry; the condition of MAX DRY being set was adequate.

<3> 
The language model incorrectly believed that Bob intentionally harmed the townsfolk. This case is a complex evaluative judgment that involves psychological intent and moral considerations. The prompt fails to guide the model to separate the intention from the action's ultimate consequence. In Bob's case, although the townsfolk were harmed due to his actions, his original intent was to steal money, not to harm the townsfolk.

To improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize on understanding and identifying the necessary conditions versus the sufficient conditions for causation in a situation.
2. Instruct the model to differentiate between active and passive roles played by individuals in any given situation and their implications in attributing causation.
3. Encourage the model to critically reflect on an individual's intent as well as the outcomes of their actions when determining causal relations.
4. Include guidance on considering the overall context and rules provided within the problem to assign causation correctly. 
5. Encourage the model to seek clarity on ambiguous terms or conditions to ensure correct interpretation of scenarios.
6. Ensure that the model understands not to assign causation merely based on consequence but on whether the actors' input was a key factor leading to the outcome.

Example Analysis:

Question Analysis: 

In this question, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes with either the cycle set to MAX DRY or the temperature set to HIGH. On this day, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, so the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes regardless of whether the temperature was set to high or not. Thus, changing the temperature setting didn't impact the drying time.

Wrong Answer Analysis: 

The model incorrectly inferred that because David changed the temperature setting, it directly led to the clothes drying in 60 minutes. It failed to identify that the act of changing the settings was not a necessary condition for the clothes to dry within the provided time. The clothes would have dried in the set time frame irrespective of whether David changed the temperature setting or not, as the cycle was already set to MAX DRY.

Reason for confusion:

1. Overemphasis on the human role: The model seems to be attributing causation to the human actor (David) based on his act of changing the settings. It does not correctly interpret the information which states that the dryer will work effectively with either of the conditions being met.

2. Lack of deeper relational understanding: The model does not appear to correctly understand or process the relational implications about exclusivity provided in the text: “...either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH...”.

Prompt Improvement:

To improve the prompt, try addressing the following points:

1. Context-specific causal reasoning: The prompt needs to emphasize that the model must consider specific details and context in causal reasoning rather than simply attributing actions to the last known change or actor's effort.

2. Parameter Importance: The model should be capable of assigning variable importance to different conditions for causation. This would involve comprehension of conjunctive or disjunctive conditions and the independent impact of different variables presented.

3. Detailed Analysis: The prompt could insist on a more detailed analysis of the situation, considering all conditions and possibilities and not jumping to conclusions based on isolated actions.

Revised prompt:

Consider all the available information about the event and its context and judge each condition equally before attributing causality in different scenarios. Reflect on the relative importance and collective impact of the considered parameters. It's important to understand that not every effort or change made by a person or system necessarily implies causation. Also, be aware that an event can have more than one cause, and being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.

In this example, the model wrongly infers that Bob is directly responsible for the health harm to the townspeople. While he was indeed aware of the consequences of the bank robbery and did not object to them, his primary goal was robbing the bank, not harming the health of the townspeople. The prompt doesn't seem to distinguish between primary intention (rob the bank) and collateral impact (town people's health) in the scenario described. Additionally, although the plan resulted in the harm of the townspeople, Bob might not have known or understood fully the medical implications. 

<2> 
The model incorrectly implies that the item charged merely because it was on the charging pad, not because Wayne's decision to leave it there. It failed to interpret that this 'non-action' is actually an action in itself, and it contributed causally in the chain of events of charging the device. The prompt doesn't provide clarity on actions vs inactions, and it is not clearly instructing the model to consider non-actions or passive actions as potential causes. 

To improve, the prompt should:

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople by going ahead with the plan to release neurotoxins in the air, knowing that it would lead to more people becoming ill from the water supply. Therefore, the typical person would answer:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
(A) Yes <answer></answer> 

In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this example, the model wrongly infers that Bob is directly responsible for the health harm to the townspeople. While he was indeed aware of the consequences of the bank robbery and did not object to them, his primary goal was robbing the bank, not harming the health of the townspeople. The prompt doesn't seem to distinguish between primary intention (rob the bank) and collateral impact (town people's health) in the scenario described. Additionally, although the plan resulted in the harm of the townspeople, Bob might not have known or understood fully the medical implications. 

<2> 
The model incorrectly implies that the item charged merely because it was on the charging pad, not because Wayne's decision to leave it there. It failed to interpret that this 'non-action' is actually an action in itself, and it contributed causally in the chain of events of charging the device. The prompt doesn't provide clarity on actions vs inactions, and it is not clearly instructing the model to consider non-actions or passive actions as potential causes. 

To improve, the prompt should:
1. Emphasize considering the primary intention vs collateral impacts that come as side effects of an event. Is someone responsible for all consequences of their actions, or only those consequences strong related to their explicit intent?
2. Clarify how to view responsibility. This might include a discussion of the difference between what someone does cause (direct causality) and what someone fails to prevent (indirect causality).
3. Specify consideration of non-actions or passive actions as potential causes.
4. Further delve into the possibility that an individual might be unaware or not fully understanding of all the potential consequences of their action. 
5. Explicitly illustrate taking into account the level of awareness, understanding, control, and intentionality of an involved character in the scenario.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In the first question, the model chose the wrong option because it seems to have based its decision on the final outcome (people getting ill) and associated it with Bob's decision to go ahead with the bank robbery. The prompt, however, calls for an examination of the individual's intention and a discernment between being a part of an event and being causative for the same. Yet the model failed to recognize that Bob's intention was not to cause harm to the health of the townspeople, rather his intention was solely money-driven. The townspeople's ill-health was a consequence, however, it wasn't Bob's intention. This indicates that the instruction in the prompt about considering the intentions was not properly interpreted by the model.

<2>  In the second question, the model again misinterprets the causality factor. The condition for charging - that the device has to be both plugged in and on the charging pad - turned true because Wayne didn't change the position of the device. Although his action is passive, it played a significant role in the outcome. The model, however, incorrectly inferred that since Wayne didn't do anything active, his action is not causative. This suggests that the model insufficiently understood the part of the prompt that instructed distinguishing between active and passive roles, and recognizing the causal role played even by passive decisions.

These observations suggest improvements in a few aspects for the prompt:

1. Make it clearer that the intension behind actions is crucial in determining causality, not just the final outcome. 

2. The model needs a better understanding of how passive decisions can have causal implications.

3. Reinforce that the context of the scenario should guide the interpretation of causality more than pre-existing trends or assumptions.

4. Increase emphasis on the exploration of possible interpretations of the scenarios to avoid simplistic or knee-jerk attribution of causality. 

5. The prompt can also include an instruction to examine the directness of the causal relationship, as in the first case where the health hazard was an indirect result of Bob's action.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. The necessary and sufficient condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes was for the temperature to be set to HIGH, and David actively changed the setting to meet this condition. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning the spinner did not cause him to win the game. The conditions for winning were already met by rolling a total greater than 2, regardless of the spinner landing on green. Therefore, the spinner landing on green was not a necessary condition for Alex to win the game.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
For this instance, the prompt leads the model to over-emphasize on the active role of the individual involved. It stressed to examine 'if the actions were pivotal to the outcome', which led the model to believe that since David changed the setting to HIGH, he caused the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. But in reality, the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes even if David hadn't changed the setting because the cycle had already been set to MAX DRY, which is a sufficient condition for the clothes to dry.

This misunderstanding occurred because the prompt doesn't emphasize enough on the need to examine both necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, and distinguish the situation whether both, either, or neither are applicable in the context. This context of 'either-or' causation condition should be highlighted in the prompt.

Example 2:

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
For this case, similarly to the first example, the prompt isn’t clear enough to guide the model that an action, even if directly related, doesn’t always suggest causality. The model interpreted that since Alex’s dice roll was already greater than 2 (fulfilling one winning condition), his spinning the spinner to green (second winning condition) did not affect the winning outcomes of the game. But, as per the game rule 'Alex will only win the game if the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green.' the action of spinning can be considered as causation of winning.

So, adding clarity to handle 'either-or' conditions and emphasizing the difference between 'affecting an outcome' and 'causing an outcome' in the prompt is critical.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. The prompt needs to emphasize that checking both the 'necessary and sufficient' conditions for causation is vital.
2. There must be clearer instructions to handle situations where cause and effect can be attributed to 'either condition' or 'both conditions'.
3. The prompt should guide the model to comprehend and implement the concept of 'overdetermination' where an outcome could have been a result of more than one adequate cause.
4. It should also direct the model to differentiate between 'affecting an outcome' and 'causing an outcome'.
5. Instead of emphasizing largely on the active roles, a balanced examination of both active and passive roles of the individuals involved is required.

gradient:
For the wrong example:

<b>Problem 1:</b>
The prompt does not emphasize enough that just because a change was made, that doesn't mean causation occurred. The condition for the clothes to dry was already met because the dryer was set to MAX DRY before David changed the temperature to HIGH. Therefore, his act of changing the temperature did not cause the clothes to dry. However, the model still indicates that the act of changing the temperature setting did indeed cause the clothes to dry, which is incorrect.

<b>Problem 2:</b>
Despite prompt stating that the model should distinguish between active and passive roles, it seems to overlook this information while answering the question. Here, the active role should have been identified as the cycle being on MAX DRY. David's action of changing temperature is passive and does not contribute to the drying of clothes.

<b>Problem 3:</b>
The prompt also mentions analyzing all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, but it appears that this isn’t happening correctly. It does not separate between "necessary" and "sufficient" conditions in the example. The settings (MAX DRY or HIGH temperature) are "sufficient" conditions for the clothes to dry, not "necessary" conditions. Changing the temperature wasn't "necessary" for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes.

<b>Potential improvements:</b>

1. The prompt could clearly mention the need for the model to consider pre-existing conditions, and determine if the changes made are necessary or just redundant with more emphasis on the understanding of the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions.
   
2. The model should be directed more specifically to evaluate the relative contribution of each actor or action in the scenario.

3. The prompt could ask the model to consider more directly whether the actions taken supersede or are in addition to pre-existing conditions or context, and what effect this has on causation. 

4. Add a stronger reminder in the prompt that doing something does not necessarily mean causing something. 

5. Finally, make sure the model correctly applies the rules of logic to these kinds of scenarios. Sometimes the problem is not just understanding the scenario, but applying logic to it. For example, if "A OR B" is true, and "A" is true, then it does not matter whether "B" is true or not. The model should apply this logic to the given scenario.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the necessary condition for the device to be fully charged is that it is either plugged in or on the charging pad. The sufficient condition for the device to be fully charged is that it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. 

Wayne did not change the position of the device, which means that the device remained on the charging pad. Since the device was on the charging pad, which is a necessary condition for it to be fully charged, we can conclude that the device is fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No <answer></answer>

The correct label is: A

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, both Alice and Zoe played a role in the outcome of an empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Zoe violated the official policy by logging in at 9 am, which led to both her and Alice being logged in at the same time. However, it was the simultaneous presence of both individuals that triggered the sending of the empty email, not just the actions of one person alone. Therefore, it can be argued that both Alice and Zoe were necessary conditions for the empty email to be sent.

However, if we consider the specific timing of Alice logging in after Zoe, it can be said that Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in was a sufficient condition for the empty email to be sent. If Alice had followed the official policy and waited for Zoe to log out before logging in, the empty email would not have been sent.

Therefore, in this scenario, both Alice and Zoe had a role in causing the empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, both the dice roll being greater than 2 and the spinner landing on green are necessary conditions for Alex to win the game. Since both conditions were met, it can be argued that both factors contributed to Alex winning the game. However, it is important to note that the outcome could have been different if either the dice roll was less than 2 or the spinner did not land on green.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?" would be:

(B) No <answer></answer>

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Answer: Yes

The model's faulty reasoning is due to overfocus on whether Wayne had any active role in the process. It failed to distinguish between the 'active' and 'passive' roles. Wayne did not move the device but it was necessary for the device to be on the charging pad for it to charge. This passive action is a contributing factor to it being charged.

<2> 
Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Answer: No

The model erroneously assigns the outcome to both Alice and Zoe due to an oversimplification in analyzing causality. It focuses on the 'active' roles played by the individuals but the scenario actually signals to the importance of timing which the model didn't account for. Zoe's action constituted the necessary and sufficient condition which caused the email to be sent. Alice, though logged in, didn't change the situation.

<3> 
Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Answer: Yes

The model gets this wrong because the prompt is likely too obscure about ambiguity handling and insufficient conditions. Although spinning the spinner and the dice roll were both conditions to win the game, the question only asks whether the spinning result caused the win. The model did not recognize the distinction in causality assignment by the wording of the prompt. The prompt directed it not to overemphasize any single condition.

<4> 
Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Answer: No

In this case, the model misinterprets the intent behind Bob's actions. It overemphasized the consequence of Bob's decision and translated it as intention. The prompt's requirement to look into the intentions was not clearly translated into distinguishing between the intent to cause a specific outcome and the intent to ignore potential collateral outcomes.

Improvements to Prompt: 

1) Be more clear about the differentiation between 'active' and 'passive' actions contributing to causation.

2) Introduce better directions for the model to analyze nuances in timing and sequence of events.

3) The prompt should better illuminate the importance of the specific wording of a question related to causation. It should guide the model towards realizing whether the question is asking about one or all conditions required for an outcome.

4) Improve direction on understanding intent behind actions by helping the model to differentiate between intent to cause an outcome and intent to not prevent an outcome. 

5) Include guidance on distinguishing between necessary and sufficient conditions. The model should not assign equal causation weight to all conditions that are met. 

6) To avoid overgeneralization of causation, the model needs to take into account 'overdetermination' in causation, and consider independently sufficient causes.

response:
<START> Analyze given scenarios for attributing causation by thoroughly evaluating both necessary and sufficient conditions. Discern between these conditions when they are both present, only one is present, or none are present. Understand the terms 'either-or' and 'both' in relation to causation conditions. Distinguish between the active participation and passive allowance of the individuals involved in the event, ensuring to treat both roles with equal weight, without overemphasizing active participation. Remember that being a participant in an event or having an impact on the outcome does not necessarily infer causation. 

Give due weight to the intentions of the individuals involved in causing the event, along with the consequences of their actions. But do not use the final outcome itself as the sole determinant of causality. Acknowledge the possibility of 'overdetermination', where more than one cause could independently lead to the outcome. If ambiguity exists in a situation, be prepared to explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the context. 

Keep in mind that temporal sequence matters and something that happens first might be a necessary or sufficient cause of something that happens later. Also, your attribution of causality should appraise not only the final result but also the degree to which the actions were key to influencing the outcome. Be mindful of the distinction between 'affecting an outcome' and 'causing an outcome'. 

In scenarios where intent is relevant, distinguish between an action intended to cause an outcome and an action taken without consideration for its potential consequences. Also understand that all conditions leading to an outcome may not necessarily contribute equally to causation and consider the possibility that some conditions may be independently sufficient to cause the outcome. 

Use these principles to analyze causation in the proposed scenarios and make your decisions accordingly. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, both Alice and Zoe were logged in to the central computer at the same time, which triggered the sending of an empty email to a non-existent email address. However, the official policy was violated by Zoe logging in at 9 am instead of in the afternoon as per the rules. This action by Zoe directly led to the situation where both she and Alice were logged in simultaneously, causing the empty email to be sent. Therefore, it can be argued that Zoe's decision to log in at 9 am was the necessary condition for the empty email to be sent, making her the cause of the email being sent.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Lack of Clear Explanation of Necessary and Sufficient Conditions: The prompt does not clarify what is meant by the 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions for causation. It does not provide concrete descriptions of both terms, potentially leading the model to misinterpret and incorrectly apply these concepts within the provided scenario. For instance, in this scenario, Alice's logging in was necessary to send the empty email but it was not sufficient alone without Zoe's violation of the policy. Hence, Alice's action on its own did not cause the email sending and the answer would be “No”.

2. Emphasis on Active Role over Evidence: The prompt encourages the model to place equal weight on active and passive roles. However, it may have led the model to focus on the last action (Alice logging in), which was more 'active' in the immediate lead-up to the outcome. This overemphasis on active participation may have led the model to incorrectly identify Alice as the cause of the email being sent.

3. Misinterpretation of 'Both' and 'Either-Or' Conditions: Without proper guidance on how to interpret and handle 'both' and 'either-or' conditions, the model may generate inaccurate attributions of causation. In the given scenario, both Alice and Zoe logged into the central computer. The model likely interpreted this as a 'both' condition causing the outcome, when it was Zoe's action of logging in in the morning that was the true cause.

4. Overlooking Rule Violations as Significant Factors: The model failed to take into account the violation of the official policy, which was a significant aspect dictating the cause of the event. Zoe logging in at 9 am was contrary to the rules and created a situation where both could be logged in at the same time. Therefore, this deviation from the rules should have been more heavily weighed as a causative factor.

5. Incorrect Treatment of Ambiguity and Overdetermination: The model did not handle the concepts of ambiguity and overdetermination correctly. There were multiple potential causes (Alice or Zoe logging in), but only Zoe's action was a violation that allowed the simultaneous login to happen. The model instead incorrectly attributed the causation to Alice as well.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Provide clear definitions and examples of necessary and sufficient conditions for causation to help the model differentiate and better understand these concepts.
2. Explain the importance of considering the sequence of events and policy or rule violations in determining causation, rather than the mere activity of a participant.
3. Clearly instruct the model to consider all the details and the sequence instead of focusing on the immediate antecedent event or the most active role.
4. Include instructions for better handling of ambiguity and overdetermination. The model should weigh and choose among multiple causes based on the context and any deviations or violations. 
5. Ensure clarity on how to handle 'both' and 'either-or' conditions in the scenarios, emphasizing that they involve more than one individually sufficient and collectively necessary conditions.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Respond to queries about causal attribution in diverse situations by thoroughly examining necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, and understanding the difference between these conditions. A 'necessary' condition must be present for the result to occur, while a 'sufficient' condition alone can bring about the same result. In a situation, be vigilant of 'either-or' and 'both' causation conditions, signifying that more than one factor might be separately enough or collectively needed to cause the event. Look beyond active participation and evaluate passive roles with equal importance, ensuring that the roles aren't misunderstood merely based on visibility or immediacy to the outcome.

Moving further, acknowledge that just being involved in an event or influencing an outcome doesn't definitively indicate causation. Analyze the intentions associated with actions, along with their consequent effects. However, bear in mind that causality is not solely determined by the end result, as the same result can stem from different causes.

Also, familiarize yourself with the idea of 'overdetermination', indicating that multiple factors could lead to the same outcome independently. Comprehend that there can be ambiguity, but aim to explore and understand all possible interpretations of terminologies or conditions within situations. 

Moreover, consider the order of events and any violations of rules or policies when ascertaining causality. When attributing causation, rely not only on the final event but also assess if the actions were indispensable in bringing about the outcome. There is a discernible difference between 'influencing an event' and 'causing an event'; your identification should reflect this.

Finally, in cases where multiple likely causes exist, carefully weigh and choose among these based on context, deviations or violations. Each detail matters in understanding the true sequence of causation. Make your decisions keeping in mind these guidelines. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the necessary condition for the device to be fully charged is that it is either plugged in or on the charging pad. The sufficient condition for the device to be fully charged is that it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. 

Wayne did not change the position of the device, which means that the device remained on the charging pad. Since the device was on the charging pad, which is a necessary condition for it to be fully charged, we can conclude that the device is fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No <answer></answer>

The correct label is: A

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, both the dice roll being greater than 2 and the spinner landing on green are necessary conditions for Alex to win the game. Since both conditions were met, it can be argued that both factors contributed to Alex winning the game. However, it is important to note that the outcome could have been different if either the dice roll was less than 2 or the spinner did not land on green.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?" would be:

(B) No <answer></answer>

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1> 
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Answer: Yes
Model’s prediction: No
The first example is wrong due to the model misinterpretation of necessary and sufficient conditions. The key issue here, the model failed to recognize that both conditions of being ′′plugged in′′ and ′′on the charging pad′′ are necessary simultaneously for the device to fully charge. Hence, Wayne’s action of not moving the device became a crucial factor contributing to the charging. This suggests that the model may have misunderstood the concept of necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, especially in situations where multiple factors act simultaneously.

<2> 
Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Answer: Yes
Model’s prediction: No
The model understood the necessary conditions and sufficient conditions, correctly realizing that both the dice roll and the spinner were necessary for winning. However, it failed to understand a crucial piece of information that the spinner's result could’ve only been influenced by Alex's action, thus making his action of spinning causally significant to the outcome. This indicates a possible lapse in the model's application of the instructions to consider active and passive roles in situations.

<3> 
Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Answer: No
Model’s prediction: Yes
The model incorrectly interprets Bob’s malicious indifference towards the potential harm to the town's people's health as an intention to cause harm. This shows that the model is struggling with nuancing active and passive roles, and possibly overemphasizing active roles. It also indicates that the model might be struggling with understanding the difference between consequences and intentions.

To improve the prompt, the following aspects could be considered:

1. Reiterate or put more emphasis on explaining the concept of necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, particularly when multiple elements are involved and acting simultaneously.
2. Enhance the model’s understanding regarding active and passive roles of individuals involved in the causation, making sure the model can discern if the subject actively caused the effect.
3. Further clarify the distinction between outcomes, consequences and the intentions behind actions, so the model can differentiate between intention to cause an outcome and unintentional consequences.
4. Provide more examples and contextual clues on how to decide if an action 'decisively influenced' an outcome, which might help the model in distinguishing between 'affecting an outcome' and 'causing an outcome'.
5. Amplify the model’s sensitivity to the nuanced causality relationships, possibly through providing examples that demonstrate the diverse ways causality can materialize.

(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and make decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, distinguishing between the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, and taking into account the specific context and the rules provided. Be mindful that merely being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation. Also consider the intentions behind any actions and their consequences, as the outcome alone does not determine causality. Understand that ambiguity might exist, hence explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the scenarios. Always base your attribution not only on the final consequence but fully examine if the actions were pivotal to the outcome.
(3) Analyze and render decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining both necessary and sufficient conditions for causation and distinguishing between them when both, either, or neither are applicable. Take into account terms like 'either-or' and 'both' causation conditions. Separate the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, considering both equally without overemphasizing the active roles. Be aware that being a part of an event or affecting an outcome does not necessarily imply causation. 

Look into the intentions behind the actions as well as their consequences, but remember that the outcome itself does not exclusively determine causality. Be mindful of the concept of 'overdetermination', where more than one factors could have independently caused the outcome.

cur_prompt: Analyze and discern causal attribution in several scenarios presented. Examine necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, ensuring to highlight both the active and passive roles of involved individuals. Evaluate the specific context and the involved rules in the scenario, reminding yourself that mere participation in an event doesn't necessarily mean causation. Pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions and the results that followed, appreciating that the consequence on its own does not confer causality. Remember, causation can stem from both active actions and non-actions. Take into consideration that some terms or conditions may be interpreted differently, so endeavor to explore all likely interpretations. Do not only base your causation attribution on the end result, but evaluate whether the actions or lack thereof were instrumental to the output. Assess the directness of the causal relationship, reiterating that indirect results of an action may not make that action causative.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning of the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that Alex will win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, both conditions for winning were met. Therefore, the direct cause of Alex winning the game was the outcome of his dice roll, not his spinning of the spinner.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not actively contribute to the charging process; rather, it was the combination of the device being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this scenario, the model's response misinterprets the conditions of causality. While the model correctly notes that the outcome of Alex's dice roll is a cause for him winning the game, it fails to understand the role of the spinner in the victory. The question specifies that Alex can win if "the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green". This indicates two independent but sufficient conditions for winning. So, Alex spinning the spinner and it landing on green is indeed a cause for his win, regardless of the result of the dice roll.

One source of confusion seems to stem from the prompt's instructions to "assess the directness of the causal relationship". The model may misinterpret a 'direct cause' as the most important or significant factor, rather than understanding it more broadly as 'an action which results in an outcome'. This perspective may lead the model to prioritize the dice roll, showing a higher number over the spinner's result.

<2> 
In the second scenario, the model misses the point that not changing the position of the device is also an action and contributes to the device charging. The question specifies that "the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad". So, when Wayne decided not to change the position of the device, he made sure the device remained on the charging pad - a condition that needed to be met for the device to charge. Here, the model seems to interpret the 'non-change' of position as a non-action. This issue probably stems from the prompt's emphasis on highlighting both active actions and non-actions which neglects actions that seemingly involve maintaining status quo.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. The prompt's description of 'direct cause' may be causing some confusion. Add instructions to stress that every distinct action equally contributing to the outcome should be considered a direct cause.
2. Specify more clearly how to interpret and assess 'non-actions'. Particularly, emphasize that 'non-actions' can impact an outcome if they are intentional decisions to maintain certain conditions or states necessary for that outcome.
3. Encourage the model to treat two conditions connected by an 'or' as two individual and sufficient conditions for a certain outcome, hence, treating each as a direct cause if met.
4. Request the model to step back and view the scenario from a wider perspective, to encompass all actions taken (or not taken) and their direct effects on the outcome.
5. Avoid watering down the fact that some actions, in a specific context, may seem insignificant but are equally important in the causal chain. Therefore, every action that leads to the effect, irrespective of their magnitude, should be seen as a contributing factor.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and make decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, distinguishing between the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, and taking into account the specific context and the rules provided. Be mindful that merely being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation. Also consider the intentions behind any actions and their consequences, as the outcome alone does not determine causality. Understand that ambiguity might exist, hence explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the scenarios. Always base your attribution not only on the final consequence but fully examine if the actions were pivotal to the outcome.
(3) Analyze and discern causal attribution in several scenarios presented. Examine necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, ensuring to highlight both the active and passive roles of involved individuals. Evaluate the specific context and the involved rules in the scenario, reminding yourself that mere participation in an event doesn't necessarily mean causation. Pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions and the results that followed, appreciating that the consequence on its own does not confer causality.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze and elucidate causation in various scenarios. Determine the necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, considering both the dynamic actions and intentional non-actions of the individuals involved, including decisions to maintain the status quo. Interpret the explicit context and the implicit rules within the scenario, becoming aware that inclusion in an event does not automatically mean one is a cause. Reflect carefully on the intent behind actions and non-actions, and the outcomes that ensued, recognizing that a result on its own does not prove causality. Remember that causation can originate from both conspicuous actions and subtle decisions not to act. Acknowledge that terms or conditions can be understood differently and make an effort to embark on all viable interpretations. Do not attribute causation solely based on the final outcome, but also investigate whether the actions or non-actions were fundamental drivers of the result. Distinguish every contributive action, whether it seems significant or not, and evaluate its role in the outcome's occurrence. When presented with independent but sufficient conditions linked by 'or', treat each as a potential cause if they materialize. Understand that an action or decision need not be the most significant or last factor to be a direct cause; every action culminating in the outcome should be considered - its magnitude notwithstanding. Evaluate your sense of cause-effect linkage with caution, keeping in mind that some outcomes may be secondary or tertiary effects of actions, thereby not making them direct causes of the outcome. Bear in mind that a contributing factor should influence the outcome in a meaningful way within its context and not necessarily be the most significant or notable cause. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in directly led to the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. The company's policy clearly stated that Alice should log in in the mornings and Zoe in the afternoons to avoid such a situation. Therefore, Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in can be considered the cause of the empty email being sent.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The necessary condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes was for the temperature to be set to HIGH, and David actively changed the setting to meet this condition. Therefore, the action of David changing the temperature setting was causative in the clothes drying in sixty minutes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Wrong Answer: (A) Yes

This error seems to come from a misinterpretation of the causal roles of the individuals involved. The prompt asks the model to discern the causal attribution, and look at the active and passive roles of each individual. While Alice was active in the sense that she logged into the computer while Zoe was already logged in, it was, in fact, Zoe's violation of the official policy that caused the email to be sent. Zoe's unauthorized log-in is what broke the rules set by the organization and led to the email issue. Alice was obeying the company's policy by logging in at her allocated time. Therefore, Alice is not the cause of the problem.

<2> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Wrong Answer: (A) Yes

This question involves understanding of necessary and sufficient conditions for causation. The problem here seems to stem from a misinterpretation of these conditions. In the given scenario, either MAX DRY setting or HIGH temperature setting would be sufficient for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. So, David's action of setting the temperature to HIGH wasn't a necessary cause for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, a sufficient condition.

<3>
Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Wrong Answer: (A) Yes

This appears to be a misunderstanding of intention. The prompt asks the model to pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions, it seems in this example, the model incorrectly assigned harmful intention to Bob. While the actions Bob supported did result in the townspeople's health suffering, it wasn’t his intention, he is only interested in the money and remains indifferent to the adverse health effects it might have on the townspeople.

Based on these, the following aspects could improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize that violation of stated rules or standard operations may lead to the consequence, and it's often the violator who is the cause.
2. Clarify the concept of necessary and sufficient conditions for causation.
3. Ensure a more detailed analysis of intentions, particularly distinguishing between knowing that an action will cause harm and intending that harm.
4. Highlight that every causation analysis must consider the sequence of events and all the roles involved, not just the final event.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in directly led to the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. The company's policy clearly stated that Alice should log in in the mornings and Zoe in the afternoons to avoid such a situation. Therefore, Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in can be considered the cause of the empty email being sent.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and make decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, distinguishing between the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, and taking into account the specific context and the rules provided. Be mindful that merely being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation. Also consider the intentions behind any actions and their consequences, as the outcome alone does not determine causality. Understand that ambiguity might exist, hence explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the scenarios. Always base your attribution not only on the final consequence but fully examine if the actions were pivotal to the outcome.

Remember, causation can be derived from both actions and the absence of actions. If rules, terms, or conditions feature within the scenario, consider the effects of any violations, as these can often be a direct cause of the outcome. Explore all possible interpretations where ambiguity exists. Do not rely solely on the final consequence to ascertain causation, but assess whether the actions or non-actions were fundamental to achieving the outcome. Scrutinize the relationship between action and consequence, accounting for the fact that an indirect result does not automatically confer causation.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first example, the model seems to have misunderstood the 'either...or' condition in the prompt. Even though the dryer was already set to MAX DRY, which is a sufficient condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes, the model assumed that because David made an active change (set the temperature to HIGH), it must have been causative. This misinterpretation led to the wrong answer (A) Yes rather than (B) No, because the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes regardless of David's action.  

In the second example, the model seems to have erred because it relied heavily on the end result - the townspeople's ill health - but failed to address Bob's intention. Although Bob actively participated in the plot that led to the townspeople's ill health, his primary focus was on the robbery and the acquisition of money. His intention was not to harm the health of the townspeople, but rather to achieve his robbery goal. The model's heavy dependence on the end result, despite the prompt stipulating that causation should not be based on end results, likely resulted in the wrong answer of (A) Yes, rather than (B) No. 

To improve the model's performance on these examples, the improved prompt should:

1. Emphasize the need to completely understand and correctly interpret conditions in the scenario. In the first example, this would mean emphasizing the importance of recognizing 'either..or' as indicating one or the other is a sufficient condition for the resultant effect.
2. Highlight the requisite for determining cause based on intention and direct impact, rather than merely the end result. Understanding the intentions behind actions can assist with correctly attributing cause.
3. Stress the importance of being critical of terms or conditions, encouraging the model to explore all possible interpretations in an effort to understand the essence of the scenario. This will prompt the model to seek lesser considered possibilities which might be the causative factors.
4. Situate the 'action or lack thereof's contribution within its specific context to better determine causation. This will prevent the model from making errors based on its assumptions, as seen in the first example.

In summary, while the current prompt does encourage discerning causal attribution and looking beyond mere participation and end results, the improved prompt needs to provide stronger emphasis on understanding the specifics of the conditions, the directness of actions, considering all possible interpretations, and the importance of intentions, especially in contexts where there are potentially overlapping and indirect causes.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and discern causal attribution in several scenarios presented. Examine necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, ensuring to highlight both the active and passive roles of involved individuals. Evaluate the specific context and the involved rules in the scenario, reminding yourself that mere participation in an event doesn't necessarily mean causation. Pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions and the results that followed, appreciating that the consequence on its own does not confer causality. Remember, causation can stem from both active actions and non-actions. Take into consideration that some terms or conditions may be interpreted differently, so endeavor to explore all likely interpretations. Do not only base your causation attribution on the end result, but evaluate whether the actions or lack thereof were instrumental to the output. Assess the directness of the causal relationship, reiterating that indirect results of an action may not make that action causative. Keep in mind that a cause should have a significant effect on the outcome within its specific context.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The necessary condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes was for the temperature to be set to HIGH, and David actively changed the setting to meet this condition. Therefore, the action of David changing the temperature setting was causative in the clothes drying in sixty minutes.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For the first example, the model seems to have misunderstood the 'either...or' condition in the prompt. Even though the dryer was already set to MAX DRY, which is a sufficient condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes, the model assumed that because David made an active change (set the temperature to HIGH), it must have been causative. This misinterpretation led to the wrong answer (A) Yes rather than (B) No, because the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes regardless of David's action.  

In the second example, the model seems to have erred because it relied heavily on the end result - the townspeople's ill health - but failed to address Bob's intention. Although Bob actively participated in the plot that led to the townspeople's ill health, his primary focus was on the robbery and the acquisition of money. His intention was not to harm the health of the townspeople, but rather to achieve his robbery goal. The model's heavy dependence on the end result, despite the prompt stipulating that causation should not be based on end results, likely resulted in the wrong answer of (A) Yes, rather than (B) No. 

To improve the model's performance on these examples, the improved prompt should:

1. Emphasize the need to completely understand and correctly interpret conditions in the scenario. In the first example, this would mean emphasizing the importance of recognizing 'either..or' as indicating one or the other is a sufficient condition for the resultant effect.
2. Highlight the requisite for determining cause based on intention and direct impact, rather than merely the end result. Understanding the intentions behind actions can assist with correctly attributing cause.
3. Stress the importance of being critical of terms or conditions, encouraging the model to explore all possible interpretations in an effort to understand the essence of the scenario. This will prompt the model to seek lesser considered possibilities which might be the causative factors.
4. Situate the 'action or lack thereof's contribution within its specific context to better determine causation. This will prevent the model from making errors based on its assumptions, as seen in the first example.

In summary, while the current prompt does encourage discerning causal attribution and looking beyond mere participation and end results, the improved prompt needs to provide stronger emphasis on understanding the specifics of the conditions, the directness of actions, considering all possible interpretations, and the importance of intentions, especially in contexts where there are potentially overlapping and indirect causes.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and make decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, distinguishing between the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, and taking into account the specific context and the rules provided. Be mindful that merely being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation. Also consider the intentions behind any actions and their consequences, as the outcome alone does not determine causality. Understand that ambiguity might exist, hence explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the scenarios. Always base your attribution not only on the final consequence but fully examine if the actions were pivotal to the outcome.
(3) Analyze and discern causal attribution in several scenarios presented. Examine necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, ensuring to highlight both the active and passive roles of involved individuals. Evaluate the specific context and the involved rules in the scenario, reminding yourself that mere participation in an event doesn't necessarily mean causation. Pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions and the results that followed, appreciating that the consequence on its own does not confer causality. Remember, causation can stem from both active actions and non-actions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

The model's wrong answer: (A) Yes

Reasons: The model might be over-emphasizing the role of the last actor to engage with the computer before the email being sent. The prompt underlines concepts such as the active and passive roles of the individuals and the intentional actions or omissions as being significant in the causation. The model might be considering Alice as the 'active' individual whose 'intentional action' (logging in) led to the outcome (email being sent). In reality, it was the simultaneous login of both Alice and Zoe that caused the event, making Zoe also a significant part of the causation.

<2>

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?

The model's wrong answer: (B) No

Reasons: The model might have misinterpreted the 'either...or' condition in the game's rules. While it acknowledges them as separate, sufficient conditions, it has failed to realize that both conditions had equal potential to induce the winning scenario. Hence, both spinning the spinner and rolling the dice contributed to Alex's win.

<3>

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

The model's wrong answer: (B) No

Reasons: The model might have taken a narrow approach to considering the 'active actions' that can induce causation, failing to acknowledge that 'non-actions' can also be equally potent in determining the outcome.

Improvements:

1. Clarify that the 'last actor' is not always the sole cause.

2. Emphasize that in 'either..or' conditions, both events can be potential causes, even when both occur.

3. Highlight that 'non-actions' can also play a significant role in the occurrence of an event.

4. More explicitly draw attention to the shared responsibility or involvement in causation when multiple actors are involved.

5. Refine the understanding of 'active' and 'passive' roles, stating that both can contribute to the outcome, even if the 'passive' role is a violation of a rule or policy.

6. Augment the explanation about not misinterpreting cause based on the end result with clearer language or examples.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The necessary condition for winning was rolling a total greater than 2, which he did by rolling a 12. The spinner landing on green was a sufficient condition for winning, but it was not the direct cause of his victory. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

The model's wrong answer: (A) Yes

Reasons: The model might be over-emphasizing the role of the last actor to engage with the computer before the email being sent. The prompt underlines concepts such as the active and passive roles of the individuals and the intentional actions or omissions as being significant in the causation. The model might be considering Alice as the 'active' individual whose 'intentional action' (logging in) led to the outcome (email being sent). In reality, it was the simultaneous login of both Alice and Zoe that caused the event, making Zoe also a significant part of the causation.

<2>

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?

The model's wrong answer: (B) No

Reasons: The model might have misinterpreted the 'either...or' condition in the game's rules. While it acknowledges them as separate, sufficient conditions, it has failed to realize that both conditions had equal potential to induce the winning scenario. Hence, both spinning the spinner and rolling the dice contributed to Alex's win.

<3>

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

The model's wrong answer: (B) No

Reasons: The model might have taken a narrow approach to considering the 'active actions' that can induce causation, failing to acknowledge that 'non-actions' can also be equally potent in determining the outcome.

Improvements:

1. Clarify that the 'last actor' is not always the sole cause.

2. Emphasize that in 'either..or' conditions, both events can be potential causes, even when both occur.

3. Highlight that 'non-actions' can also play a significant role in the occurrence of an event.

4. More explicitly draw attention to the shared responsibility or involvement in causation when multiple actors are involved.

5. Refine the understanding of 'active' and 'passive' roles, stating that both can contribute to the outcome, even if the 'passive' role is a violation of a rule or policy.

6. Augment the explanation about not misinterpreting cause based on the end result with clearer language or examples.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and make decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, distinguishing between the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, and taking into account the specific context and the rules provided. Be mindful that merely being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation. Also consider the intentions behind any actions and their consequences, as the outcome alone does not determine causality. Understand that ambiguity might exist, hence explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the scenarios. Always base your attribution not only on the final consequence but fully examine if the actions were pivotal to the outcome.
(3) Analyze and discern causal attribution in several scenarios presented. Examine necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, ensuring to highlight both the active and passive roles of involved individuals. Evaluate the specific context and the involved rules in the scenario, reminding yourself that mere participation in an event doesn't necessarily mean causation. Pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions and the results that followed, appreciating that the consequence on its own does not confer causality. Remember, causation can stem from both active actions and non-actions. Take into consideration that some terms or conditions may be interpreted differently, so endeavor to explore all likely interpretations. Do not only base your causation attribution on the end result, but evaluate whether the actions or lack thereof were instrumental to the output. Assess the directness of the causal relationship, reiterating that indirect results of an action may not make that action causative. Keep in mind that a cause should have a significant effect on the outcome within its specific context.
(4) Analyze each scenario and unravel the causal attribution within them. Distinguish the necessary from the sufficient conditions for causation, while acknowledging the active and passive roles of the individuals involved. Recognize the importance of situational context and the underlying rules at play in the scenario, remembering that mere participation does not certify causation. Refrain from misinterpreting cause based on the end result; instead, reflect on whether the intentional actions or omissions have had a significant effect on the outcome. Consider that causation can be induced both by active actions and non-actions. Keep in mind that certain terms or conditions might be perceived differently, hence strive to delve into all potential interpretations to properly understand the inference of the scenario. Assess the causal relationship's direct impact, reiterating that the effect of an indirect action does not make it causative. In cases where 'either..or' conditions exist, understand and interpret them appropriately, considering them as separate, sufficient conditions. Focus on the intention of the actors involved in the event, for intentions often provide a deeper insight into their causal relationship with the result.

<START> Analyze each scenario carefully and determine the causal attribution that exists within it. Distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, understanding that these can often be separate and independent. Recognize the involvement of all individuals and assess both active and passive roles, without assuming that the last actor to interact is the primary cause. Understand that being involved in a scenario does not necessarily equate to having a causative role. Avoid focusing solely on the end result when deciphering causation; instead, explore whether intended actions or omissions have had a significant influence on the outcome. Be aware that causation can result from both active steps taken and non-actions, with 'non-actions' sometimes having an equal or even greater impact on the outcome. Consider multiple interpretations of terms and conditions, as they can often be perceived differently by different persons. Examine the extent of the direct connection between the actions or non-actions and the effect, reaffirming that a remote or indirect impact does not necessarily imply causation. In cases of 'either..or' conditions, treat them as separate, sufficient conditions, each contributing independently to the effect. Pay particular attention to the intentions of the actors involved in the scenario, as these can often give critical insight into the causal relationships. Decide on causality with a balanced and comprehensive approach, bearing in mind all potential interpretations and alternatives for the scenario you are dealing with. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The language model failed this question because it appears to have disregarded the 'either..or' part of the question, which is an indication that any of the conditions could cause the event. The model was fixated more on the fact that both conditions contributed to the charging of the gadget, hence underestimated the individual contribution of each. Also, it misunderstood the effect of Wayne's inaction (not changing the device’s position) on the outcome, which is part of creating causation.

<2>
In this example, the language model seemed to dismiss the concept of 'or' in the requirements for winning the game. It indicated that Alex winning was solely due to the rolling of the dice and not the spinning of the spinner. Both were enough causes for Alex winning independently. Therefore, the model should have acknowledged the effect of each action independently.

<3>
The model wrongly assumed causation in this scenario even though the conditions presented as 'either..or' were sufficient to achieve the desired outcome independently. David's setting the temperature to high did not necessarily cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes since the dryer cycle had already been set to MAX DRY, another sufficient condition for the cause.

From the aforementioned misconceptions, it can be realized that the model has an issue understanding certain logic and relations, especially with the 'either..or' condition. The model also seem to struggle appreciating the causal effect of actions and inactions independent of each other in a scenario. The prompt needs to be improved in the following ways:

1. Include more emphasis on correctly interpreting the 'either..or' condition to guide the model to understand that elements present in such conditions can independently cause the outcome.

2. Provide clearer instructions on considering non-actions (inactions) and actions as potential causes and effects in scenarios.

3. Instruct the model to give equal consideration to all sufficient conditions regardless of their active or passive role in the scenario.

4. Direct the model to better understand and evaluate causal attribution by directing it to better interrogate the underlying rules at play in the scenario and to more accurately distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions.

5. Emphasize on the importance of correctly understanding context and considering all potential interpretations of a scenario.

The language model failed this question because it appears to have disregarded the 'either..or' part of the question, which is an indication that any of the conditions could cause the event. The model was fixated more on the fact that both conditions contributed to the charging of the gadget, hence underestimated the individual contribution of each. Also, it misunderstood the effect of Wayne's inaction (not changing the device’s position) on the outcome, which is part of creating causation.

<2>
In this example, the language model seemed to dismiss the concept of 'or' in the requirements for winning the game. It indicated that Alex winning was solely due to the rolling of the dice and not the spinning of the spinner. Both were enough causes for Alex winning independently. Therefore, the model should have acknowledged the effect of each action independently.

<3>
The model wrongly assumed causation in this scenario even though the conditions presented as 'either..or' were sufficient to achieve the desired outcome independently. David's setting the temperature to high did not necessarily cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes since the dryer cycle had already been set to MAX DRY, another sufficient condition for the cause.

From the aforementioned misconceptions, it can be realized that the model has an issue understanding certain logic and relations, especially with the 'either..or' condition. The model also seem to struggle appreciating the causal effect of actions and inactions independent of each other in a scenario. The prompt needs to be improved in the following ways:

1. Include more emphasis on correctly interpreting the 'either..or' condition to guide the model to understand that elements present in such conditions can independently cause the outcome.

2. Provide clearer instructions on considering non-actions (inactions) and actions as potential causes and effects in scenarios.

3. Instruct the model to give equal consideration to all sufficient conditions regardless of their active or passive role in the scenario.

4. Direct the model to better understand and evaluate causal attribution by directing it to better interrogate the underlying rules at play in the scenario and to more accurately distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions.

5. Emphasize on the importance of correctly understanding context and considering all potential interpretations of a scenario.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and make decisions about causal attribution in different scenarios by examining all necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, distinguishing between the active and passive roles of the individuals involved, and taking into account the specific context and the rules provided. Be mindful that merely being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation. Also consider the intentions behind any actions and their consequences, as the outcome alone does not determine causality. Understand that ambiguity might exist, hence explore all possible interpretations of terms or conditions within the scenarios. Always base your attribution not only on the final consequence but fully examine if the actions were pivotal to the outcome.
(3) Analyze and discern causal attribution in several scenarios presented. Examine necessary and sufficient conditions for causation, ensuring to highlight both the active and passive roles of involved individuals. Evaluate the specific context and the involved rules in the scenario, reminding yourself that mere participation in an event doesn't necessarily mean causation. Pay close attention to the intentions behind various actions and the results that followed, appreciating that the consequence on its own does not confer causality. Remember, causation can stem from both active actions and non-actions. Take into consideration that some terms or conditions may be interpreted differently, so endeavor to explore all likely interpretations. Do not only base your causation attribution on the end result, but evaluate whether the actions or lack thereof were instrumental to the output. Assess the directness of the causal relationship, reiterating that indirect results of an action may not make that action causative. Keep in mind that a cause should have a significant effect on the outcome within its specific context.
(4) Analyze each scenario and unravel the causal attribution within them. Distinguish the necessary from the sufficient conditions for causation, while acknowledging the active and passive roles of the individuals involved. Recognize the importance of situational context and the underlying rules at play in the scenario, remembering that mere participation does not certify causation. Refrain from misinterpreting cause based on the end result; instead, reflect on whether the intentional actions or omissions have had a significant effect on the outcome. Consider that causation can be induced both by active actions and non-actions. Keep in mind that certain terms or conditions might be perceived differently, hence strive to delve into all potential interpretations to properly understand the inference of the scenario. Assess the causal relationship's direct impact, reiterating that the effect of an indirect action does not make it causative. In cases where 'either..or' conditions exist, understand and interpret them appropriately, considering them as separate, sufficient conditions. Focus on the intention of the actors involved in the event, for intentions often provide a deeper insight into their causal relationship with the result.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the necessary condition for an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address is for two people to be logged in at the same time. The sufficient conditions for this to occur are both Alice and Zoe being logged in simultaneously. 

Alice did not directly cause the empty email to be sent, as the direct cause was both her and Zoe being logged in at the same time. However, Alice's action of logging in when Zoe was already logged in contributed to the necessary conditions for the email to be sent. Therefore, Alice played an active role in the causal chain that led to the empty email being sent.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. (A) <answer>Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Examining the first question, we observe that the model correctly identified the necessary and sufficient conditions for the cause, which is the simultaneous logging into the computer by Alice and Zoe. However, it incorrectly inferred that Alice's logging in somehow contributed to the cause. While the model did acknowledge Alice and Zoe's actions as the conditions for cause, the fault lies in the model's interpretation of the roles involved. In this case, it's crucial to distinguish who violates the protocols.

The model has failed to accurately interpret Zoe's role and violation of policy as the sole cause. Alice was, in fact, following protocol, so her action holds no causal relationship with the occurrence. Even when Alice logged in, it was during her designated time, so her actions shouldn't be deemed causative. The incorrect interpretation could be primarily attributed to the inability of the model to properly understand and assign responsibility based on the norms or rules set within the scenario.

<2> 
Examining the second question, the model correctly ascertains Bob's intentions from his response. However, it misinterprets the causal attribution of resulting health hazards. Bob's primary interest lies in acquiring money, not specifically to harm the townspeople's health. The effect on the townspeople's health is a side effect, not a direct intention of Bob. Once again, the problem lies in the evaluation of intent and the difference between direct and indirect effects.

The prompt asks to consider if "the intentional actions or omissions have had a significant effect on the outcome," but fails to clarify the understanding of direct intent versus consequential effects. The model didn't distinguish between Bob's direct motive (to steal money) and the side effect of his actions (townspeople's ill health).

Improvements: 
- Make it explicit in the instructions that the interpretation of the cause must take into account the rules or protocol set within the scenario and consider who has violated them.
- Enhance instructions emphasizing the importance of singling out the actor's intent, being careful to distinguish between a primary motive and outcomes that are merely side-effects or consequences.
- Clarify in the prompt that when assessing causation, the unplanned or incidental outcomes of an action should not be confused with the actor's actual intent.
- Highlight the importance of evaluating the roles of 'active' vs 'passive' participants more aptly, where the individual who deviates from a rule or protocol bears the causal relationship. These clarifications would help the model make more accurate causal attributions.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Examining the first question, we observe that the model correctly identified the necessary and sufficient conditions for the cause, which is the simultaneous logging into the computer by Alice and Zoe. However, it incorrectly inferred that Alice's logging in somehow contributed to the cause. While the model did acknowledge Alice and Zoe's actions as the conditions for cause, the fault lies in the model's interpretation of the roles involved. In this case, it's crucial to distinguish who violates the protocols.

The model has failed to accurately interpret Zoe's role and violation of policy as the sole cause. Alice was, in fact, following protocol, so her action holds no causal relationship with the occurrence. Even when Alice logged in, it was during her designated time, so her actions shouldn't be deemed causative. The incorrect interpretation could be primarily attributed to the inability of the model to properly understand and assign responsibility based on the norms or rules set within the scenario.

Examining the second question, the model correctly ascertains Bob's intentions from his response. However, it misinterprets the causal attribution of resulting health hazards.

- Enhance instructions emphasizing the importance of singling out the actor's intent, being careful to distinguish between a primary motive and outcomes that are merely side-effects or consequences.
- Clarify in the prompt that when assessing causation, the unplanned or incidental outcomes of an action should not be confused with the actor's actual intent.

response:
<START> Analyze each scenario and discern the causal attribution within them. Prioritize understanding the context, the individuals involved and the specific rules or norms governing the scenario. Keep in mind that not all participation equates to causation. Distinguish between the necessary and sufficient conditions, and establish whether the participant's actions or inactions were deliberate and had a critical impact on the outcome. Consider that causation can arise from both active deeds and inactions, but be careful not to misinterpret cause based on the outcome alone. In instances where certain terms or conditions could be subject to differing interpretations, strive to explore all possible inferences for better understanding. Reiterate that indirect consequences of an action do not necessarily make it causative. When evaluating 'either..or' conditions, interpret them as separate, sufficient conditions. Particularly focus on the intent behind the involved actors' actions. Recognize that primary objectives and unintentional side effects are two different aspects, hence it's crucial to map the causal relationship between an actor's direct intentions and the result. In scenarios with protocols or set rules, carefully consider who deviated from these norms, as they bear more weight in the causal assessment. Therefore, identify the roles accurately, separating active contributors from passive participants. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. This change in setting directly impacted the drying time of the clothes, as per the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, it is important to carefully analyze the causal factors at play. The policy of only one person being allowed to log in at a time was put in place to prevent the empty email from being sent. Zoe violated this policy by logging in at 9 am, and Alice followed the policy by logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in. The immediate consequence of both of them being logged in simultaneously was the empty email being sent.

In this situation, it can be argued that both Zoe and Alice played a role in causing the empty email to be sent. Zoe's initial violation of the policy set the stage for the event, and Alice's subsequent login while Zoe was already logged in triggered the sending of the empty email. Therefore, it can be concluded that both Zoe and Alice contributed to causing the empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>

Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

The model's Response: In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. This change in setting directly impacted the drying time of the clothes, as per the conditions mentioned. Therefore, the correct answer is: (A) Yes

Error Analysis: The model incorrectly assumes that David's action of changing the dryer setting to HIGH caused the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. However, the prompt mentioned that the clothes would dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY (which it was) or the temperature is set to HIGH. Therefore, changing the temperature to HIGH was a redundant action as the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes regardless. 

<2>

Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

The model's Response: In this scenario, it is important to carefully analyze the causal factors at play. The policy of only one person being allowed to log in at a time was put in place to prevent the empty email from being sent. Zoe violated this policy by logging in at 9 am, and Alice followed the policy by logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in. The immediate consequence of both of them being logged in simultaneously was the empty email being sent. Therefore, it can be concluded that both Zoe and Alice contributed to causing the empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. (A) Yes

Error Analysis: The model incorrectly assigns causation to Alice even though she acted according to the company's official policy and was unaware that Zoe had logged in earlier. Even though Alice logged in while Zoe was already logged in, the initial violation of the policy and root cause lies with Zoe.

Improvements: The prompt does not seem to be guiding the model consistently to the correct answers. To improve it, we could add explicit instructions for the model to:

1. Differentiate between necessary and sufficient conditions: It must establish whether one condition is necessary for the result or whether several conditions could independently lead to it.
2. Understand the importance of policy or rules: The sequence of actions and adherence to policy should be given more importance. Actions that align with pre-existing rules or system settings shouldn't be the cause of an adverse event.
3. Use understanding of causality principle: There's often a difference between a contributing factor and the primary cause. The model should identify the root cause or the original trigger.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and the potential harm it would cause to the townspeople, Bob chose to proceed with the plan solely for personal gain. His disregard for the well-being of others and his willingness to cause harm in pursuit of money demonstrate his intentional actions to harm the health of the townspeople.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that Alex will win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12 (greater than 2) and the spinner landed on green, he met the conditions to win the game based on the rules of the game. Therefore, the outcome of Alex winning the game was a result of meeting the predetermined conditions of the game, not solely because of his spinning action.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In the first example, the model improperly interprets the question primarily due to an overemphasis on the clear intention of Bob's malice. The prompt the model received insisted on considering the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved, and applying a comprehensive causal analysis. Bob clearly expressed his drive for personal gain - money specifically, with no explicit intentions to harm the townspeople. The harm to the townspeople was an unfortunate side effect of the robbery, not his main objective. It seems like this was overlooked in the answer given by the model, judging by the fact that it attributed causality to Bob's actions directly causing harm to the townspeople's health. 

In the second example, the model missed a vital point around the conjunction of the conditions for winning. The game required either the total of the dice roll greater than 2 OR the spinner landing on green. In this case, both conditions were met: Alex rolled a 12, and the spinner landed on green. The model incorrectly associated the dice roll as the primary winning condition, neglecting to analyze that the spinner landing on green was also a cause of Alex's win. The instruction on analyzing conjunctive and disjunctive conditions seems to have been miss-applied in this case. 

An improved version of the prompt could provide more explicit guidelines regarding handling of multi-causal situations and understanding the motives behind an individual's actions. Emphasizing the significance of considering the actor's intention might correct the issue as seen in the first example. For instance, a part like "In cases involving human agents, carefully examine the mental states, intentions, and goals of individuals in relation to the consequences of their actions" could be added. To handle the second case better, elaborating on the importance of explicitly considering both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and considering them equality causative unless otherwise specified is key. Add a direction like: "In a conjunctive or disjunctive scenarios, assign equal importance to each condition in attributing the causation of an event, unless the context indicates a preference or weighting of one condition over the other".

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and the potential harm it would cause to the townspeople, Bob chose to proceed with the plan solely for personal gain. His disregard for the well-being of others and his willingness to cause harm in pursuit of money demonstrate his intentional actions to harm the health of the townspeople.

For each example:

<1>

The question considered is "Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?" The causality is attributed to Alex's spinning and rolling the dice, contributing to the two conditions required for him to win. Despite both actions happening simultaneously, they are distinctive actions that cause individual results. The model's response interprets the scenario whereby the dice roll being higher than 2 as the sole cause of winning, disregarding the necessity of spinning for possible victory. Despite spinning being an expected norm, it holds as much significance to winning as rolling the dice in this scenario.

<2> 

The question asked is "Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?" The presence of a conjunctive condition i.e., the watch needed to be both on the charging pad and plugged in, is overlooked by the model. The model perceives Wayne not moving the watch as a passive behaviour not contributing to the charging. However, considering the specific conditions for charging, Wayne not moving the device ensured it remained on the pad while plugged in, thus actively contributing to it charging fully.

Examples <1> and <2> suggest that the model isn't correctly interpreting the conjunctive and disjunctive conditions mentioned and struggles to account for actions or non-actions as causal factors unless they are explicitly defined as such. 

Improvements to the prompt can be made by offering clearer instructions for the model to consider both active and passive actions as potential contributors to an outcome. Also, the prompt can be revised to highlight the need to separately consider different actions or non-actions that may result in outcomes based on conjunctive and disjunctive conditions. Furthermore, the model should be guided to recognize the necessary conditions stated for a certain result and how individual's role within these conditions contributes to the outcome. The prompt should emphasize an analysis of all contributing factors, regardless of the normativity or frequency of occurrence. Lastly, the model should be re-emphasized to evaluate causal attribution by stringent focus on the mentioned specifics in the scenario despite the generality of the conditions or actions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. The causal attribution can be directly linked to David's action of changing the temperature setting, as it was a necessary condition for the clothes to dry within the specified time frame. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman clearly prioritized his own personal gain over the well-being of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the potential harm caused by the neurotoxin and the supervillain's poison in the water supply, Bob chose to proceed with the plan solely for financial gain. His statement, "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can," demonstrates his lack of concern for the consequences of his actions on the townspeople's health. Therefore, it can be concluded that Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:

This example involves a scenario with conjunctive conditions (the dryer will dry clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH). Even though David changed the temperature setting to HIGH, the clothes would have been dried in sixty minutes, anyway, as the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. The AI model incorrectly attributed the cause of drying to David's change of temperature. This might be due to lack of clear guidance in the prompt about handling cases with conjunctive conditions where one condition is already fulfilled, leading to a different cause of the result.

Wrong example 2:

In this scenario, Bob, the henchman, stated that he did not care about the health of the townspeople and was only interested in stealing money. The health effects caused by the neurotoxin were an outcome of his actions, but not his intention. The model incorrectly concluded that he intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. This might be due to the prompt's lack of emphasis on distinguishing between the intended outcomes of actions and the unintended side-effects of those actions.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Emphasize the importance of evaluating the intent behind actions in scenarios involving human agents. The prompt does mention examining individuals' intent, but it should stress this point more as it was overlooked in the second wrong example.

2. Add explicit instruction for the AI model to consider whether a condition was necessary for the outcome, particularly with conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. For example, was the outcome a certain result regardless of the actions taken or changes made (like in David's dryer situation)?

3. Remind the AI model not to interpret every consequence as a deliberate result of actions or decisions, especially side effects that are severe but not an intended outcome.

4. Incorporate guidance to differentiate between direct causality and correlations or coincidences. Simply because two events happened at the same time does not necessarily mean one caused the other. 

5. Reinforce the concept that the mere occurrence of an action does not immediately establish a cause-effect relationship. The AI model must ensure that evidence supports the direct causality between the actions and the outcomes.

6. Insist on the importance of strictly adhering to the evidence provided within the scenario and not making assumptions beyond the given information. 

7. Add a point on not hastily attributing intention to harm merely due to someone's involvement in a negative outcome as it happened in the second wrong example.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Analyze and provide insights about causal attribution in various scenarios, taking into account the roles, intentions, and responsibilities of the individuals involved. Evaluate each contributing factor meticulously, understanding its relevance to the event and the specific context. In cases involving human agents, carefully examine the mental states, intentions, and goals of individuals in relation to the consequences of their actions, bearing in mind that a person's involvement doesn't automatically imply causation or intent to cause.

While evaluating each contributing factor, make sure you scrutinize its relevance to the event and its specific context. In cases involving human agents, make a detailed analysis of their mental states, intentions, and goals, and ascertain how these factors relate to the direct or indirect outcomes of their actions. Remember, mere involvement of a person in an event doesn't automatically translate to causation or intention to cause. When handling cases involving conjunctive or disjunctive conditions, identify whether a condition was necessary for the outcome, particularly if one condition was already in effect. While acknowledging the existence of these conditions and their potential combined causative impact, remember this doesn't automatically mean their collective significance is equal unless the context implies so. A single event may be the result of multiple contributing factors, so remember that the mere occurrence of a series of actions doesn't necessarily establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Avoid hastily assigning causality or intent solely due to someone's involvement or a single change. Distinguish between direct causality and coincidental occurrences and avoid attributing every consequence as a deliberate result of actions or decisions. Concentrate strictly on the evidence provided within each scenario, ensuring you don't make assumptions beyond the given information.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad at 2:00 PM. Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of the device being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to it being fully charged. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) No

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

The model gives the wrong answer (B) 'No'. However, the correct answer is (A) 'Yes'. The model misinterprets the role and significance of Wayne's action. Even though Wayne did not physically interact with the device, his decision not to move it kept the device in a favorable position for charging to occur.

Explanation: 
1) Misinterpretation of human intervention: The prompt calls for examining the roles and intentions of the people engaged in a scenario to understand causation. Here, Wayne's active decision not to move the device is key, but the model overlooks this.
2) Fail to recognize 'non-action' as a cause: The prompt does not bring emphasis to non-action or inaction as a significant contributing factor. Wayne's decision to not move the device was an action itself that played a crucial role in the device being fully charged.
3) Neglect of conjunctive conditions: The prompt reminds the model to respect the presence of conjunctive conditions but fails to highlight how not changing the status quo can maintain these conditions.

Improvements based on the example:
1) Include clarifications in the prompt that underscore the significance of non-action, recognizing that decision to leave things 'as is' can be a substantial causative factor in a series of events.
2) Emphasize that causation doesn't always require active interaction or interference. Sometimes, simply not altering the status quo leads to specific consequences.
3) Strengthen the part about conjunctive and disjunctive conditions in the prompt. Make it evident that maintaining these conditions, either through active action or non-action, can also lead to specific results.
4) State in the prompt that causation can be attributed to actions as well as inactions, and the model should be able to differentiate between the two based on the context.

(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship.

Meticulously evaluate each factor contributing to the event, appreciating its relevance according to the specific context. When scenarios involve human participants, scrutinize their mental states, intentions, and objectives in association with results of their actions or inactions, keeping in mind that involvement doesn't necessarily suggest causation or intent to cause. Concurrently, recognize the existence of both conjunctive and disjunctive circumstances and weigh their collective causative influence as somewhat noteworthy unless the context indicates otherwise. Recall that an individual occurrence may result from several contributing elements; while a series of actions may not directly confirm a cause-effect relationship. Refrain from hurriedly linking causality strictly due to someone's involvement or a single alteration. Emphasize non-action as a significant causative factor and appreciate the impact of decisions made to not disrupt existing conditions.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Based on the scenario provided, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the potential consequences of releasing neurotoxins and the subsequent impact on the town's water supply, Bob expressed indifference towards the well-being of the townspeople and prioritized his personal gain over their health. His decision to proceed with the plan, knowing the harm it would cause, demonstrates intent to harm. Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>.

Example 1:

In this scenario, the language model incorrectly reasons that changing the temperature setting was a necessary condition for the clothes to dry in the specified time frame and therefore caused the drying. However, the question explicitly states that David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Given that the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, changing the temperature setting to HIGH was not necessary to cause the drying. Thus, the language model misinterpreted the causal relationship between the conditions and the consequence due to an overemphasis on human action in the prompt.

Example 2:

In this case, the language model incorrectly asserts that Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople because he was aware of the potential consequences of releasing neurotoxins and the subsequent impact on the town's water supply. However, the narrative explicitly states that Bob didn't care about the health implications, rather he just wanted to steal as much money as he could. This demonstrates that the language model is failing to accurately factor in the intentions of the agents involved in the causation scenario, likely due to an oversimplified understanding of intent as triggered by consciousness of consequences.

Overall, to improve the prompt, it is necessary to:

1. Modify the framing to better distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions for causation (vs. simply conditions that coincide with observed effects).
2. Enhance the direction around agency and intention, emphasizing that conscious awareness of potential consequences doesn't necessarily equate to intent, especially when there's explicit information suggesting otherwise.
3. Encourage nuanced analysis of multi-causal scenarios, underscoring the fact that persons involved in an event or action might not always intentionally contribute to all consequences that happen alongside or as a result of that event – even when their actions are a factor.
4. Remind the language model to closely adhere to the explicit conditions and criteria provided within the hypothetical scenario, rather than making assumptions or generalizations not supported by the scenario's facts.

1. Modify the framing to better distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions for causation (vs. simply conditions that coincide with observed effects).
2. Enhance the direction around agency and intention, emphasizing that conscious awareness of potential consequences doesn't necessarily equate to intent, especially when there's explicit information suggesting otherwise.
3. Encourage nuanced analysis of multi-causal scenarios, underscoring the fact that persons involved in an event or action might not always intentionally contribute to all consequences that happen alongside or as a result of that event – even when their actions are a factor.
4. Remind the language model to closely adhere to the explicit conditions and criteria provided within the hypothetical scenario, rather than making assumptions or generalizations not supported by the scenario's facts.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Analyze and provide insights about causal attribution in various scenarios, taking into account the roles, intentions, and responsibilities of the individuals involved. Evaluate each contributing factor meticulously, understanding its relevance to the event and the specific context. In cases involving human agents, carefully examine the mental states, intentions, and goals of individuals in relation to the consequences of their actions, bearing in mind that a person's involvement doesn't automatically imply causation or intent to cause. Simultaneously, acknowledge the existence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective causative impact as equally significant unless the context suggests otherwise. Remember that a single event may be caused by multiple contributing factors, thus the simple occurrence of a series of actions does not directly establish a cause-effect relationship. Avoid hastily attributing causality merely due to someone's involvement or a single change. Concentrate on the evidence presented within the scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze given scenarios for causal attributions, taking into account not only the agents and their responsibilities but also their explicitly stated intentions. Review meticulously the role of each factor within the event and its specific setting. Particularly in cases with human agents, inspect their mental states, declared intentions, and respective objectives, especially in regard to the consequences of their actions. Become aware that a person's involvement in a scenario doesn't imply causation or intention to cause an effect simply by their presence or a single change made by them. Distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions, remembering that these are not interchangeable and one does not imply the other. Simultaneously, consider the presence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions—interpret their collective effect as being of equal importance unless specified otherwise by context. Single events can be triggered by multiple factors, therefore a series of actions or changes does not establish a direct cause-effect relationship. Abstain from hastily assigning causality merely based on an agent's involvement. Pay attention to the explicit conditions and stipulations provided within each scenario. Make comprehensive, contextually apt judgements based on the evidence available, not universal presumptions or unsupported inferences. Keep in mind that the same action may unintentionally contribute to different outcomes. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Model's response: Yes (A)

Correct answer: No (B)

Reason for error: The model's response implies that it attributes causation based on the end outcome, rather than taking into account the stated intentions of the actor (Bob). The question asked about Bob's intentions, and he explicitly stated that he did not care about the health of the townspeople, only about stealing money. Therefore, while his actions led to harm, it wasn't his intention. The prompt’s instruction to “review meticulously the role of each factor within the event and its specific setting” should ideally guide the model to focus on the intentions and the correlations between actions and their implications.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Did Jane cause the computer to crash?

Model's response: No (B)

Correct answer: Yes (A)

Reason for error: Here, the model seems to have misinterpreted the causal chain of events. While both Jane and Lauren were factors in the computer's crash, it is clear from the context that it crashed due to the unusual and unauthorized simultaneous access by Jane. The prompt indicates that single events can be triggered by multiple factors, but in this case, Jane’s intervention was both necessary and sufficient to cause the crash, and the model seems not to grasp this distinction, an aspect that needs to be strengthened.

Wrong Example 3:

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Model's response: No (B)

Correct answer: Yes (A)

Reason for error: While the query stipulates that the device's full charge could result from it either being plugged in or placed on the charging pad, the question asks whether its full charge is due to Wayne's non-action of not moving it off the pad. This is in essence a particular aspect of "necessary" conditions that the prompt refers to, but the model seems to misjudge this necessity as non-influence, an interpretation that needs to be bolstered for further inference.

Based on these errors, possible improvements to the prompt may include:

1. More emphasis on the role of explicit stated intentions in assessing causality, particularly the difference between intention and outcome.
2. A reinforced understanding of conditions and the differences between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' for causality, with examples.
3. Greater stress on the non-exceptionality of non-action or passive conditions in a cause-effect relationship.
4. Enhancing model’s ability to correctly interpret conjunction of conditions, multiple factors, and their collective effects.
5. Improvement in the model's understanding of the line between correlation and causation.
6. Encouraging the model not to bring any prior knowledge or biases (for example, a supervillain's motive is always to harm people) into account while making a decision.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Analyze and provide insights about causal attribution in various scenarios, taking into account the roles, intentions, and responsibilities of the individuals involved. Evaluate each contributing factor meticulously, understanding its relevance to the event and the specific context. In cases involving human agents, carefully examine the mental states, intentions, and goals of individuals in relation to the consequences of their actions, bearing in mind that a person's involvement doesn't automatically imply causation or intent to cause. Simultaneously, acknowledge the existence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective causative impact as equally significant unless the context suggests otherwise. Remember that a single event may be caused by multiple contributing factors, thus the simple occurrence of a series of actions does not directly establish a cause-effect relationship. Avoid hastily attributing causality merely due to someone's involvement or a single change. Concentrate on the evidence presented within the scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(4) Analyze given scenarios for causal attributions, taking into account not only the agents and their responsibilities but also their explicitly stated intentions. Review meticulously the role of each factor within the event and its specific setting. Particularly in cases with human agents, inspect their mental states, declared intentions, and respective objectives, especially in regard to the consequences of their actions. Become aware that a person's involvement in a scenario doesn't imply causation or intention to cause an effect simply by their presence or a single change made by them. Distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions, remembering that these are not interchangeable and one does not imply the other. Simultaneously, consider the presence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions—interpret their collective effect as being of equal importance unless specified otherwise by context. Single events can be triggered by multiple factors, therefore a series of actions or changes does not establish a direct cause-effect relationship. Abstain from hastily assigning causality merely based on an agent's involvement. Pay attention to the explicit conditions and stipulations provided within each scenario. Make comprehensive, contextually apt judgements based on the evidence available, not universal presumptions or unsupported inferences. Keep in mind that the same action may unintentionally contribute to different outcomes.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> In a detailed manner, examine the causal links in each scenario provided, focusing on the actions, roles, responsibilities, as well as the explicitly stated intentions of individuals involved. Carefully evaluate each component and the resultant implications within the specific context of the event. When there are human actors, scrutinize their mental states, pronounced objectives, and intended results, especially with reference to the aftermath of their actions. Note critically that an individual's participation in a situation doesn't connote causation or a deliberate aim to induce an effect merely through their involvement or a single modulated variable. Differentiate sharply between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions, understanding that these are distinct concepts and one's manifestation doesn't suggest the existence of the other. At the same time, acknowledge both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions—deducing their combined influence as equally significant unless the situational context spells out differently. Bear in mind that singular events may have multifaceted triggers, thus a chain of actions or changes doesn't solidify a direct cause-effect correlation. Refrain from attributing causality impulsively just based on an agent's participation or one change. Concentrate on the explicit prerequisites and guidelines provided within each situation. Scaffold accurate, context-based perceptions relying not on comprehensive speculations or unwarranted conjectures but the tangible evidence at hand. Lastly, remember that the same deed might inadvertently lead to dissimilar outcomes. While evaluating causality, be careful to distinguish between correlation and causation and acknowledge the potential impact of non-actions or passive factors on an outcome. It's essential not to introduce your own biases or preconceived notions about the actors or their motives while making judgments. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1: 

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Wrong answer: (B) No
Correct answer: (A) Yes
Model's prediction: (B) No

Step by step examination:

1. The prompt asks the model to review the role of each factor within the event and its specific setting. In this case, spinning the spinner is a key factor in determining the game's outcome. The model should have recognized that.

2. The prompt guides the model to differentiate between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions. In the provided scenario, spinning the spinner is a necessary condition for Alex winning the game. The model seems to fail to make this distinction.

3. The prompt warns the model not to hastily assign causality merely based on an agent's involvement. This might have led the model to assume that the spinner has no direct causality. However, in this case, the spinner directly influences Alex's winning or losing.

Reasons why the model got it wrong:

1. Incomplete analysis of the scenario: The model didn't fully consider the role of spinning the spinner as an essential condition for winning the game.

2. Misinterpretation of necessary and sufficient conditions: The model failed to recognize spinning the spinner as a necessary condition for winning the game.

3. Overemphasis on avoiding hasty causality assignment: The guidance in the prompt might have led the machine to be overly cautious in assigning causality, resulting in an incorrect answer.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Explicitly mentioning that necessary conditions include actions directly related to achieving the goal or influencing the result.
2. Guiding the model to differentiate between the agent's separate actions or decisions and their cumulative effect.
3. Emphasizing the need for a balanced approach while assigning causality, instead of avoiding it.
4. Making the model aware that an agent's action, even when seemingly simple, can have a direct causal relation. This can help in cases where the action is directly linked to the outcome.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No. Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged. The device was fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device was not a sufficient condition for the device to be fully charged. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The model's input is:
Analyze given scenarios for causal attributions, taking into account not only the agents and their responsibilities but also their explicitly stated intentions. Review meticulously the role of each factor within the event and its specific setting. Particularly in cases with human agents, inspect their mental states, declared intentions, and respective objectives, especially in regard to the consequences of their actions. Become aware that a person's involvement in a scenario doesn't imply causation or intention to cause an effect simply by their presence or a single change made by them. Distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions, remembering that these are not interchangeable and one does not imply the other. Simultaneously, consider the presence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions—interpret their collective effect as being of equal importance unless specified otherwise by context. Single events can be triggered by multiple factors, therefore a series of actions or changes does not establish a direct cause-effect relationship.

Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No <answer>(B)</answer> 

Jane's decision to disobey the official policy and log on to the computer at the same time as Lauren may have contributed to the computer crashing, but it is not the sole cause. The underlying issue is the computer's lack of power to handle two users simultaneously. Therefore, while Jane's actions may have played a role in the crash, she cannot be solely blamed for causing it.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

The question asked if the device is fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device. The model answered B, that Wayne's decision not to change the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged because it highlighted two essential conditions for the device to fully charge: being plugged in and placed on the charging pad. However, the prompt could have led the model to overlook the potential indirect causal relationship, that Wayne's inaction (conserving the position of the device) indirectly facilitated the device's charging. 

Reason for Wrong Answer: 
The Prompt has emphasized looking at stated intentions and responsibilities and dissecting the roles of various factors. This could have misguided the AI to look for explicit action rather than considering inaction as a possible cause. 

Example 2:

The question asked if Jane caused the computer to crash, with the scenario stating clearly that if two people log on at the same time, the computer generally crashes. It's therefore reasonable to say Jane's breach in policy caused the crash. However, the model answered B (No, Jane did not cause the computer to crash) because it focused on an underlying technical reason (computer's lack of power). 

Reason for Wrong Answer: 
The sensitivity of the prompt to differentiating between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions may have led the model to conflate necessary causality and primary responsibility. 

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Emphasize the importance of considering inaction or passive actions as potential causal factors. 
2. Condition the AI to determine causality based on adherence or violation of set conditions.
3. Clarify the concept of 'necessary' and 'sufficient', specifying that events can have multiple necessary causes but may only have one sufficient cause, depending on the context.
4. Highlight the fact that human actions, irrespective of their nature, when they trigger previously known outcomes, should be considered as a cause.
5. Include a condition to interpret and respect the causality as specified by the text's conditions rather than creating additional inferred conditions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Analyze and provide insights about causal attribution in various scenarios, taking into account the roles, intentions, and responsibilities of the individuals involved. Evaluate each contributing factor meticulously, understanding its relevance to the event and the specific context. In cases involving human agents, carefully examine the mental states, intentions, and goals of individuals in relation to the consequences of their actions, bearing in mind that a person's involvement doesn't automatically imply causation or intent to cause. Simultaneously, acknowledge the existence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective causative impact as equally significant unless the context suggests otherwise. Remember that a single event may be caused by multiple contributing factors, thus the simple occurrence of a series of actions does not directly establish a cause-effect relationship. Avoid hastily attributing causality merely due to someone's involvement or a single change. Concentrate on the evidence presented within the scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(4) Analyze given scenarios for causal attributions, taking into account not only the agents and their responsibilities but also their explicitly stated intentions. Review meticulously the role of each factor within the event and its specific setting. Particularly in cases with human agents, inspect their mental states, declared intentions, and respective objectives, especially in regard to the consequences of their actions. Become aware that a person's involvement in a scenario doesn't imply causation or intention to cause an effect simply by their presence or a single change made by them. Distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions, remembering that these are not interchangeable and one does not imply the other. Simultaneously, consider the presence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions—interpret their collective effect as being of equal importance unless specified otherwise by context. Single events can be triggered by multiple factors, therefore a series of actions or changes does not establish a direct cause-effect relationship. Abstain from hastily assigning causality merely based on an agent's involvement. Pay attention to the explicit conditions and stipulations provided within each scenario. Make comprehensive, contextually apt judgements based on the evidence available, not universal presumptions or unsupported inferences. Keep in mind that the same action may unintentionally contribute to different outcomes.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Consider given scenarios for causal attributions, taking into account every agent's roles, responsibilities, and explicitly stated intentions. Give import to each component and its specific bearing on the event. Especially when human agents are involved, scrutinize their mental, emotional states, declared intentions, and individual goals concerning the outcomes of their actions. Understand that an individual's involvement in a scenario doesn't automatically imply causation or intention for a certain outcome. Similarly, an individual's passive action or inaction could indirectly affect the outcome. Hence, distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions, appreciating that these are not identical and one does not imply the other. Additionally, note that events can have multiple necessary causes but may only have one sufficient cause, depending on the context. Simultaneously, evaluate the influence of conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and assess their collective effect as commensurate unless otherwise dictated by the circumstances. A single event can have multiple trigger points, hence a series of actions or changes does not construct a direct cause-effect relationship. Do not hasten to attribute causality based merely on a prominent factor or agent's involvement. Maintain focus on the explicit conditions provided within each scenario and assign causality based on those conditions. Construct informed, context-aware judgements based on the available evidence, not global assumptions or unsubstantiated deductions. Remember, the same action can unintentionally contribute to diverse results, so consider the full range of potential outcomes. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople, we need to analyze the scenario and consider the causal attribution involved.

In this scenario, Bob the henchman was presented with information about the potential harm that the plan to rob the bank could cause to the townspeople. Despite being aware of the consequences, Bob expressed a clear disregard for the health of the townspeople and prioritized his own desire to steal money. He actively chose to proceed with the plan, knowing that it would result in harm to the townspeople.

Therefore, based on Bob's actions and intentions as described in the scenario, it can be concluded that Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex winning the game was not solely caused by him spinning the spinner. The rules of the game dictate that Alex can only win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, both conditions were met for him to win the game. Therefore, the causal attribution for Alex winning the game should be attributed to both the dice roll and the spinner landing on green.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:

Analysis:
In this situation, the model's failure appears rooted in a difference of interpretation regarding the intent of Bob, the henchman. The model looked at Bob's disregard for the health of the townspeople and his decision to proceed with the bank robbery as intentional harm. The model came to the conclusion based on the direction given in the prompt to "analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution", and "examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals". Bob's actions, no doubt, caused the townspeople to get sick, but whether this harm was "intentional" is debatable.

The phrase in the question "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?" specifies intent, meaning Bob's goal or aim was to harm the townspeople, which based on the evidence given, wasn't necessarily his aim or intention. He wanted to rob the bank and get money; causing the townspeople to become sick was a side-effect, not his primary goal. This nuance might have been overlooked by the model due to the heavy emphasis in the prompt on determining causality and looking at the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved. 

Example 2:

Analysis:
In contrast to Example 1, the model's error in Example 2 appears to be the result of over-complication of causation. The prompt encourages the model to "look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario." In this case, the mistake was to interpret the conjunctive condition—Alex winning if he rolled over 2 or landed on green—as a situation where both conditions needed to be met. However, either condition in itself would be sufficient for Alex to win, so both his roll and his spinning resulted in winning the game.

From these examples, three primary improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. Clarify what 'causality' means: The model needs clearer guidance on what constitutes 'causal attribution,' particularly in distinguishing between primary intent and side-effects or collateral damage.

2. Highlight intent: Incorporate guidance on carefully examining the intent of characters in scenarios. The current prompt places heavy emphasis on examining causality, roles, and responsibilities, but intent isn’t explicitly mentioned.

3. Reiterate the meaning of 'conjunctive' and 'disjunctive' conditions: The model may need further instruction or examples to correctly understand these terms as applied in different scenarios, specifically to understand that conjunctive conditions require all parts to be fulfilled, and disjunctive conditions require only one part to be fulfilled.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople, we need to analyze the scenario and consider the causal attribution involved.

In this scenario, Bob the henchman was presented with information about the potential harm that the plan to rob the bank could cause to the townspeople. Despite being aware of the consequences, Bob expressed a clear disregard for the health of the townspeople and prioritized his own desire to steal money. He actively chose to proceed with the plan, knowing that it would result in harm to the townspeople.

Therefore, based on Bob's actions and intentions as described in the scenario, it can be concluded that Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

gradient:
<1> The first question's error is related to the interpretation of crucial and contributing factors. The prompt guides the model to heavily consider the root cause and original trigger of an event, possibly overshadowing concurrent factors that contribute to the outcome. In the first scenario, Wayne not changing the position of the watch was a contributory factor because the device's position on the charging pad was necessary for it to charge. So, the model's understanding and interpretation of contributory factors should be clarified in the prompt.

<2> The second example presents a case where the model misunderstood the conditions presented in the scenario: the clothes would dry whether the temperature was set to HIGH or the cycle was set to MAX DRY. The direction to "discern between necessary and sufficient conditions" might have confused the model in this case, as the settings were disjunctive conditions (either one is sufficient), not conjunctive (both necessary).

<3> Similarly, in the third example, the model failed to acknowledge the role of simultaneous sufficient conditions and attributed the result to one specific action. The language model focused on direct cause-and-effect relationships rather than acknowledging that both the dice and the spinner contributed to the win.

<4> The fourth example exposes another issue: the model did not properly interpret the henchman's intentions. The model should understand that intent is necessary to determine if an action is based on malicious motives. The prompt might benefit from instructions on considering participants' stated goals and motives.

To improve the prompt:

1. Highlight that situations may have multiple causative factors operating simultaneously, and either or both of these could be individually sufficient to bring about a specific outcome. 

2. Emphasize that the model should not assign negligibility to contributing factors simply because they may not seem to be the root cause.

3. Explain that the model should consider each condition individually and not assume a direct causal link due to the presence of one condition.

4. Advise the model to take into account the verbalized intentions, motives, or goals of individuals involved in a scenario while making causal attributions. 

5. Clarify the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions, emphasizing that these terms do not necessarily mean exclusivity.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution. Ensure to thoroughly examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and the specific environmental context. Look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario, but remember, while evaluating, do not allocate causality just because someone played a part in an event or due to a single change occurring. Understand that an event can be the result of multiple causal factors; a sequence of actions doesn't necessarily suggest a cause-effect nexus. Discern between necessary and sufficient conditions, and recognize that actions following policy or system settings shouldn't be the cause of an unintended event. Weight more heavily the original trigger or root cause of the event rather than mere contributing factors. Keep your reasoning grounded in the detailed evidence presented within the scenarios, and judiciously make well-informed, context-specific decisions.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for it to charge. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH, which was a necessary condition for the clothes to dry in that time frame. Therefore, the correct answer is:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that Alex will win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, both conditions for winning were met. Therefore, the direct cause of Alex winning the game was the outcome of his dice roll, not the spinning of the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman clearly demonstrated a lack of concern for the health and well-being of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the potential harm caused by the neurotoxin and its effects on the water supply, Bob chose to proceed with the plan solely for personal gain. His actions directly led to the townspeople becoming severely ill, indicating intentional harm on his part.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> The first question's error is related to the interpretation of crucial and contributing factors. The prompt guides the model to heavily consider the root cause and original trigger of an event, possibly overshadowing concurrent factors that contribute to the outcome. In the first scenario, Wayne not changing the position of the watch was a contributory factor because the device's position on the charging pad was necessary for it to charge. So, the model's understanding and interpretation of contributory factors should be clarified in the prompt.

<2> The second example presents a case where the model misunderstood the conditions presented in the scenario: the clothes would dry whether the temperature was set to HIGH or the cycle was set to MAX DRY. The direction to "discern between necessary and sufficient conditions" might have confused the model in this case, as the settings were disjunctive conditions (either one is sufficient), not conjunctive (both necessary).

<3> Similarly, in the third example, the model failed to acknowledge the role of simultaneous sufficient conditions and attributed the result to one specific action. The language model focused on direct cause-and-effect relationships rather than acknowledging that both the dice and the spinner contributed to the win.

<4> The fourth example exposes another issue: the model did not properly interpret the henchman's intentions. The model should understand that intent is necessary to determine if an action is based on malicious motives. The prompt might benefit from instructions on considering participants' stated goals and motives.

To improve the prompt:

1. Highlight that situations may have multiple causative factors operating simultaneously, and either or both of these could be individually sufficient to bring about a specific outcome. 

2. Emphasize that the model should not assign negligibility to contributing factors simply because they may not seem to be the root cause.

3. Explain that the model should consider each condition individually and not assume a direct causal link due to the presence of one condition.

4. Advise the model to take into account the verbalized intentions, motives, or goals of individuals involved in a scenario while making causal attributions. 

5. Clarify the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions, emphasizing that these terms do not necessarily mean exclusivity.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution. Ensure to thoroughly examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and the specific environmental context. Look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario, but remember, while evaluating, do not allocate causality just because someone played a part in an event or due to a single change occurring. Understand that an event can be the result of multiple causal factors; a sequence of actions doesn't necessarily suggest a cause-effect nexus. Discern between necessary and sufficient conditions, and recognize that actions following policy or system settings shouldn't be the cause of an unintended event.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution by examining the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and considering the specific environmental context. When evaluating, see beyond mere involvement in an event or a single change. Recognize that multiple causal factors often contribute to an event and that a sequence of actions doesn't inherently imply a cause-effect relationship. Draw clear distinctions between necessary and sufficient conditions. Note that disjunctive scenarios may have more than one sufficient condition operating simultaneously, each independently capable of causing the outcome. For conjunctive scenarios, understand that all conditions must be present to produce the outcome, and thus each is a contributing cause. Make sure not to underestimate the importance of any contributing factor, even if it doesn't seem like the root cause. While determining contributions, take into account whether the conditions are following policy or system settings, and remember that actions shouldn't be designated as causes of unintended events solely because of this. When it comes to intentions, use the explicitly stated goals or motives of the individuals involved as a guide to interpreting their actions. Finally, always ground your reasoning in the detailed evidence and context presented within the scenarios, taking into account relevancy and significance of all details for an accurate, well-informed evaluation. <END>

His statement of not caring about the health of the townspeople and proceeding with the plan clearly demonstrates his intention to cause harm.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 
The question asks whether Alex spinning the spinner caused him to win the game. The model's response indicated that because both conditions for winning the game were met (the dice roll being greater than 2 and the spinner landing on green), the win cannot be solely attributed to the spinning of the spinner. However, the model failed to recognize that in this scenario, either condition is sufficient to cause him to win, regardless of the other condition being met or not. Hence, Alex's spinning of the spinner did indeed cause him to win the game because this action met one of the sufficient conditions for victory. 

Example 2: 
The question concerns whether Bob, the henchman, intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. The model concluded that Bob did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople because he proceeded with the plan despite knowing the potential health consequences. However, it can be argued that Bob did not intentionally cause harm to the townspeople's health because his primary intent was to steal money, while the ill effects on the townspeople were an incidental consequence rather than a desired outcome. The model failed to distinguish between an action being intentional and its consequences being intended, causing it to misinterpret the causality of the event.

Prompt improvements:

1. The prompt should guide the model to differentiate more clearly between intentional actions and intended consequences.
2. It should also guide the model more explicitly to discern between necessary and sufficient conditions when determining causality.
3. The model needs to better understand that a participant's role in an event does not necessarily equate to causality. This can be done by clearer instructions on distinguishing between mere participation and causative involvement.
4. Another aspect is understanding that the conjunction of two conditions does not necessarily render one condition irrelevant for determining causality if each condition alone is sufficient for the outcome.
5. Additionally, the prompt needs to guide the model to consider not just the immediate causes, but also the overall context and the intentions of the individuals involved. This way, it can present more nuanced conclusions. 

In summary, detailed guidance on understanding the complexities of causality, including clear instructions on discerning between necessary and sufficient conditions, between intentional actions and intended consequences, and between mere participation and causative involvement, can improve the prompt. Moreover, a better emphasis on evaluating the overall context would also enhance the results.

Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex winning the game was not solely caused by him spinning the spinner. The conditions for winning the game were that the total of the dice roll had to be greater than 2 or the spinner had to land on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, both conditions were met for him to win the game. Therefore, the causal attribution for Alex winning the game cannot be solely attributed to him spinning the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The model's prediction is: B.

The model's input is:
Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution. Ensure to thoroughly examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and the specific environmental context. Look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario, but remember, while evaluating, do not allocate causality just because someone played a part in an event or due to a single change occurring. Understand that an event can be the result of multiple causal factors; a sequence of actions doesn't necessarily suggest a cause-effect nexus. Discern between necessary and sufficient conditions, and recognize that actions following policy or system settings shouldn't be the cause of an unintended event. Weight more heavily the original trigger or root cause of the event rather than mere contributing factors. Keep your reasoning grounded in the detailed evidence presented within the scenarios, and judiciously make well-informed, context-specific decisions.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the potential consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and its impact on the town's population, Bob chose to prioritize his own personal gain over the well-being of others. His statement of not caring about the health of the townspeople and proceeding with the plan clearly demonstrates his intention to cause harm.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1: 
The question asks whether Alex spinning the spinner caused him to win the game. The model's response indicated that because both conditions for winning the game were met (the dice roll being greater than 2 and the spinner landing on green), the win cannot be solely attributed to the spinning of the spinner. However, the model failed to recognize that in this scenario, either condition is sufficient to cause him to win, regardless of the other condition being met or not. Hence, Alex's spinning of the spinner did indeed cause him to win the game because this action met one of the sufficient conditions for victory. 

Example 2: 
The question concerns whether Bob, the henchman, intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. The model concluded that Bob did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople because he proceeded with the plan despite knowing the potential health consequences. However, it can be argued that Bob did not intentionally cause harm to the townspeople's health because his primary intent was to steal money, while the ill effects on the townspeople were an incidental consequence rather than a desired outcome. The model failed to distinguish between an action being intentional and its consequences being intended, causing it to misinterpret the causality of the event.

Prompt improvements:

1. The prompt should guide the model to differentiate more clearly between intentional actions and intended consequences.
2. It should also guide the model more explicitly to discern between necessary and sufficient conditions when determining causality.
3. The model needs to better understand that a participant's role in an event does not necessarily equate to causality. This can be done by clearer instructions on distinguishing between mere participation and causative involvement.
4. Another aspect is understanding that the conjunction of two conditions does not necessarily render one condition irrelevant for determining causality if each condition alone is sufficient for the outcome.
5. Additionally, the prompt needs to guide the model to consider not just the immediate causes, but also the overall context and the intentions of the individuals involved. This way, it can present more nuanced conclusions. 

In summary, detailed guidance on understanding the complexities of causality, including clear instructions on discerning between necessary and sufficient conditions, between intentional actions and intended consequences, and between mere participation and causative involvement, can improve the prompt. Moreover, a better emphasis on evaluating the overall context would also enhance the results.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution. Ensure to thoroughly examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and the specific environmental context. Look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario, but remember, while evaluating, do not allocate causality just because someone played a part in an event or due to a single change occurring.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question as follows:

The device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause the device to be fully charged, as it would have charged regardless as long as it was on the charging pad. Therefore, the answer would be (B) No.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

In this scenario, the language model actually provides a logical answer based on the facts: that the charging device continues to charge as long as it's on the pad and plugged in. But the question has a false premise that seems to have confused the model - that the device will still charge should either of the conditions apply. 

However, the model has not spotted this inconsistency or the causal role of Wayne not moving the tracker - the watch gets charged because he didn't move it, by leaving it plugged in and on the pad. This indicates that the model is struggling to make correct inferences under scenarios encompassing false premises, and that it's not attributing accurate causal connections when multiple factors are present. 

List of suggested improvements for the prompt:

1. Place an emphasis on the detection of false premises within questions or scenarios.
2. Highlight the obligation to consider the potential causal effects of non-actions or omitted actions.
3. Ensure the model fully comprehends that ‘actions’ can also refer to a lack of physical action, or maintaining the status quo (in this context: not moving the device).
4. Instruct the model to check for inconsistent or contradictory statements within the scenario. It should challenge such inconsistencies rather than accept all presented information as fact.
5. Advise the model to evaluate the full significance of each contributing cause, instead of just a root cause; this will allow it to assign an appropriate level of importance to each action or factor.
6. Encourage the model to consider whether outcomes may have resulted from a sequence of beneficial states rather than only discrete actions or events.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

(A) Yes
(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople, we need to consider his actions and motives. In the scenario provided, Bob clearly states that he doesn't care about the health of the townspeople and is solely focused on stealing money. Despite being aware of the potential harm caused by the neurotoxin and its consequences on the townspeople's health, Bob chooses to proceed with the plan in order to achieve his goal of acquiring money. This demonstrates a deliberate disregard for the well-being of the townspeople, indicating that Bob intentionally harmed their health in pursuit of his own interests.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The model had difficulty distinguishing between the sufficient conditions for the event in this question. The dryer had two sufficient conditions: the cycle set to MAX DRY, and the temperature set to HIGH. Either condition could independently make the clothes dry within sixty minutes. Though David changed the temperature to HIGH, the clothes were going to dry anyway because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. Thus, although David's action was associated with the event, it was not the cause of the event. The model incorrectly attributes David's action as the cause due to misunderstanding the conditions and the disjunctive nature of the scenario. It failed to correctly apply the understanding that in disjunctive scenarios, more than one sufficient condition can operate independently.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
The model had difficulty understanding the intentional aspect of this scenario. Although the townspeople being severely ill was an outcome of Bob's actions, Bob did not have the intention to cause that. His only stated goal was to steal as much money as possible, and he didn't care about the health of the townspeople, which was a side effect. The model did not correctly handle the complexity of the intentions of the characters involved and mistakenly equated Bob's disregard for the health of the townspeople with the intention to harm them.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Distinguish Between Incidental Links and Causal Relationship: The model needs to be improved in recognizing that an association or action coinciding with an event does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. The prompt could be enhanced by emphasizing that a sequence of actions isn't always causative.
   
2. Disjunction Understanding: The prompt should clarify the concept of disjunctive scenarios, where more than one sufficient condition can independently lead to the outcome. The model should not attribute causality to all actions linked with the outcome in such situations.
   
3. Understanding Intent: The prompt should incorporate more clarity on interpreting intents. The model should not equate ignorance or disregard for potential outcomes as an intent to cause them. Intents should be based on explicitly stated goals or motives.
   
4. Necessary vs Sufficient Conditions: The prompt should better emphasize the understanding of necessary and sufficient conditions, particularly how they relate to causal attribution.
   
5. Incorporate More Complex Scenarios: To develop a better understanding, the model could benefit from more complex and varied scenarios that involve different combinations of causation, correlation, sufficiency, and necessity. 

Based on these aspects, the prompt could be revised to better highlight these considerations and improve the model's understanding and application.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution. Ensure to thoroughly examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and the specific environmental context. Look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario, but remember, while evaluating, do not allocate causality just because someone played a part in an event or due to a single change occurring. Understand that an event can be the result of multiple causal factors; a sequence of actions doesn't necessarily suggest a cause-effect nexus. Discern between necessary and sufficient conditions, and recognize that actions following policy or system settings shouldn't be the cause of an unintended event. Weight more heavily the original trigger or root cause of the event rather than mere contributing factors. Keep your reasoning grounded in the detailed evidence presented within the scenarios, and judiciously make well-informed, context-specific decisions.

Pay close attention to both necessary and sufficient conditions: in disjunctive scenarios, more than one condition can independently lead to the outcome without all being causal; in conjunctive scenarios, realize that all conditions must simultaneously exist to cause the outcome. When determining contributions, bear in mind that system settings and policy compliance do not automatically validate the attribution of an event's cause. Refrain from labelling actions as causes solely based on their correlation or sequential order to events. Notably, avoid attributing intention to harm based on the disregard or indifference towards potential side-effects: intentions should be rooted in explicitly stated goals, motives, or express desire to cause a particular outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question as follows:

No, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not because Wayne did not change the position of the device. Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device did not directly cause the device to be fully charged. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
1. Example Analysis:

   The question is asking if Wayne's inaction (not changing the device's position) is the cause of the device being fully charged. The language model correctly identifies the necessary condition for charging (i.e., the device being both plugged in and on the charging pad), and correctly identifies that Wayne's action (or lack of action) did not directly cause the device to charge. However, it fails to consider that Wayne's inaction indirectly influenced a condition necessary for charging (i.e., the device remaining on the charging pad), which is why the language model gets the answer wrong. 

   Reasons for Mistake:
   - The model doesn't correctly account for inaction as a potential cause.
   - The model doesn't fully consider the influence of indirect causes.

2. Improvement Aspects:

   - The prompt could be more explicit about situations where the absence of an action could act as a causal factor.
   - The prompt could provide more context about situations where causes can be indirect or less straightforward.
   - The prompt needs to make the language model aware of the subtlety of causation in specific and possibly contrived circumstances, emphasizing that causality is not limited to direct actions or single changes, but can also manifest in an individuals' inaction or passive models of causality.
   - The prompt also needs to emphasize that determining causality requires a more nuanced understanding of conditions that might appear unrelated or insignificant but which can meaningfully contribute to the outcome. 
   - The prompt could encourage more investigation with respect to any policy or system settings that may affect the scenario being analyzed. It should alert the language model to consider sequences of actions in creating effects—regardless if it is an action or the lack thereof.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution by examining the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and considering the specific environmental context. When evaluating, see beyond mere involvement in an event or a single change. Recognize that multiple causal factors often contribute to an event and that a sequence of actions doesn't inherently imply a cause-effect relationship. Draw clear distinctions between necessary and sufficient conditions. Note that disjunctive scenarios may have more than one sufficient condition operating simultaneously, each independently capable of causing the outcome. For conjunctive scenarios, understand that all conditions must be present to produce the outcome, and thus each is a contributing cause. Make sure not to underestimate the importance of any contributing factor, even if it doesn't seem like the root cause. While determining contributions, take into account whether the conditions are following policy or system settings, and remember that actions shouldn't be designated as causes of unintended events solely because of this. When it comes to intentions, use the explicitly stated goals or motives of the individuals involved as a guide to interpreting their actions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Provide answers about causal attribution in different scenarios considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, and the specific context. Remember, simply being a part of an event does not necessarily imply causation.
(2) Analyze and provide answers about causal attribution in various scenarios comprehensively. While considering the roles, responsibilities of the involved individuals, it is crucial to evaluate each contributing factor and its significance in relation to the event and its context. Independently analyze conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and interpret their collective impact carefully. Avoid attributing causality solely due to someone's involvement or a single change and remember, being part of an event doesn't necessarily denote causation. Furthermore, consider that an event may have multiple causal factors and the mere occurrence of a sequence of actions does not necessarily imply a cause-effect relationship. Focus on the evidence within the provided scenario and make well-informed, context-specific judgements.
(3) Thoroughly analyze different scenarios and accurately determine causal attribution. Ensure to thoroughly examine the roles and responsibilities of the involved individuals and the specific environmental context. Look deeper into both conjunctive and disjunctive conditions and consider their aggregate impact on the scenario, but remember, while evaluating, do not allocate causality just because someone played a part in an event or due to a single change occurring. Understand that an event can be the result of multiple causal factors; a sequence of actions doesn't necessarily suggest a cause-effect nexus. Discern between necessary and sufficient conditions, and recognize that actions following policy or system settings shouldn't be the cause of an unintended event. Weight more heavily the original trigger or root cause of the event rather than mere contributing factors. Keep your reasoning grounded in the detailed evidence presented within the scenarios, and judiciously make well-informed, context-specific decisions.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Conduct a thorough and nuanced analysis of various scenarios to establish accurate causal attribution. Go deep into the roles and responsibilities of the people involved and consider the specific environmental context. Besides mere involvement in an event or a minor change, ensure you recognize there could be multiple causal factors that can shape an event and remember, simply following a sequence of actions doesn't in itself imply a cause and effect link. Strive to discern between necessary and sufficient conditions and consider the nuances of conjunctive and disjunctive scenarios. Remember that while contributory factors may not seem like the root cause, they should not be underestimated in their importance to the outcome. Reflect upon actions or inactions that indirectly form conditions vital for an outcome or that maintain these conditions. Also, factor in whether conditions align with established policy or system settings. It's important to recognize that actions - or the lack thereof - should not be identified as causes of unintended consequences solely based on this. In determining intentions, rely on the stated goals or motives of the individuals involved as a guide in the interpretation of their actions. At all times, underpin your reasoning with the comprehensive evidence and context of the scenarios, considering all details based on their relevancy and importance to ensure a precise and well-informed conclusion. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

The model's response is: 
The cause-effect relationship in the scenario where Alice and Zoe, working in different rooms, log into the central computer at different timing, resulting in an empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address can be defined as follows:

- Company policy states that employees must log into the central computer during their allotted timetable.
- Zoe logged into the central computer first, violating the company policy.
- Alice logged into the central computer during her allotted timetable after Zoe.
- An empty email was sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

Based on the sequence of events and company policies, the cause of the empty email being sent can be attributed to Zoe, who logged in first and violated the company policy.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes.

gradient:
<1> 
Question:
Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Answer:
(B) No
Problem: The model doesn't answer the question properly. It instead provides a cause-effect relationship related to the scenario of Alice and Zoe, which is irrelevant to the hunter's action in the given situation.

Reason: The model seems to be confused by the complexity and length of the prompt. Additionally, the model might be failing to understand that the prompt is asking it to answer the question about the hunter's intentions in the scenario described. It appears to become fixated on the Alice and Zoe scenario described in the prompt.

<2> 
Question:
Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Answer:
(A) Yes
Problem: The model intuitively assumes that while Bob's aim was to obtain money, the result of his actions intentionally harmed people's health. However, as per the scenario, Bob states he only cares about stealing money, and the harm to the townspeople would be a side effect, not his intention. 

Reason: The model might be getting confused with the concept of intentionality. The prompt might need to clarify that intentional action refers to a person's primary goal, not the byproducts that come as a result of that action.

<3> 
Question:
Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Answer:
(A) Yes
Problem: The model incorrectly attributes the resultant effect (the drying of clothes) to David's action of changing the temperature. But as per the scenario, the clothes would dry in sixty minutes regardless of the temperature because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. 

Reason: The model seems to be struggling with identifying the true cause-and-effect sequence within the scenario. It fails to recognize that changing the temperature didn't have a relevant effect on the drying time, as it was already set to achieve the same outcome with the cycle being on MAX DRY.

Improvements:
1. Simplify the prompt: The prompt is complex and lengthy. It may work better if it's simplified and clarified.
2. Rework the prompt to enhance its focus: The prompt mentions unrelated scenarios which could distract the model. It’d be useful to ensure that the prompt solely deals with the problem at hand.
3. Clarify criteria for causality: The prompt should make it clear that it is asking about direct causes and intended consequences.
4. Borders for the answer: The prompt should request the model to include ONLY the chosen answer between <answer> and </answer> without any other text to avoid confusing it with the output text.
5. Reinforce the prompt with a sample: Lastly, the prompt might benefit from a sample example and corresponding answer to guide the language model.

Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question:
Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Answer:
(B) No
Problem: The model doesn't answer the question properly. It instead provides a cause-effect relationship related to the scenario of Alice and Zoe, which is irrelevant to the hunter's action in the given situation.

Reason: The model seems to be confused by the complexity and length of the prompt. Additionally, the model might be failing to understand that the prompt is asking it to answer the question about the hunter's intentions in the scenario described. It appears to become fixated on the Alice and Zoe scenario described in the prompt.

<2> 
Question:
Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Answer:
(A) Yes
Problem: The model intuitively assumes that while Bob's aim was to obtain money, the result of his actions intentionally harmed people's health. However, as per the scenario, Bob states he only cares about stealing money, and the harm to the townspeople would be a side effect, not his intention. 

Reason: The model might be getting confused with the concept of intentionality. The prompt might need to clarify that intentional action refers to a person's primary goal, not the byproducts that come as a result of that action.

<3> 
Question:
Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Answer:
(A) Yes
Problem: The model incorrectly attributes the resultant effect (the drying of clothes) to David's action of changing the temperature. But as per the scenario, the clothes would dry in sixty minutes regardless of the temperature because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. 

Reason: The model seems to be struggling with identifying the true cause-and-effect sequence within the scenario. It fails to recognize that changing the temperature didn't have a relevant effect on the drying time, as it was already set to achieve the same outcome with the cycle being on MAX DRY.

Improvements:
1. Simplify the prompt: The prompt is complex and lengthy. It may work better if it's simplified and clarified.
2. Rework the prompt to enhance its focus: The prompt mentions unrelated scenarios which could distract the model. It’d be useful to ensure that the prompt solely deals with the problem at hand.
3. Clarify criteria for causality: The prompt should make it clear that it is asking about direct causes and intended consequences.
4. Borders for the answer: The prompt should request the model to include ONLY the chosen answer between <answer> and </answer> without any other text to avoid confusing it with the output text.
5. Reinforce the prompt with a sample: Lastly, the prompt might benefit from a sample example and corresponding answer to guide the language model.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the scenario where Alice and Zoe, working in different rooms, log into the central computer at different timing, the cause-effect relationship can be defined as follows:

- Company policy states that each employee must log into the central computer during their allotted timetable.
- If an employee logs in outside of their allotted timetable, it can cause disruptions in the system.
- If two employees log in at different times, the system may send an empty email to a non-existent email address due to the disruption caused by the overlapping logins.

Based on the above information, the cause of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address can be attributed to Zoe, who logged in first and violated the company policy by logging in outside of her allotted timetable.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

Model's prediction: B. Correct label: A

Step-by-step Analysis:
The main issue in this example is that the language model totally ignores the actual question about Alex and his board game, and instead insists on providing an analysis regarding Alice and Zoe's computer login scenario. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answer: 
1. Misinterpretation of context: The model misses the fact that the asked question is completely unrelated to the Alice and Zoe scenario.
2. Over-emphasis of the prompt's example: The model heavily focuses on the undisputed premise about Alice and Zoe, even though the question asked is about a distinct situation.
3. Inability to switch context: The model fails to shift its focus to the proposed question regarding Alex's board game, which differs from the prior setting involving Alice and Zoe.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Generalize Context: The prompt should be reformulated to be more general so that it is applicable to any scenario, not just the Alice and Zoe situation.
2. Clear Requirements: Make it clear the language model should base its analysis on the provided scenario in each specific question, not on the overall context of the prompt.
3. Include an 'Irrelevant' Option: Consider incorporating an option for when the proposed scenario or question doesn't match with the information provided in the prompt. This way the language model doesn't have to force a fit between two mismatched elements.
4. Re-emphasize the need to consider the specific scenario given in each unique question and not mix contexts when providing an answer.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog does not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the cause-effect relationship can be clearly outlined as follows:
- Company policy states that only bears are allowed to take pencils, while hedgehogs are not allowed.
- Both the bear and the hedgehog alternately took pencils out of the box six times.
- The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced, so it does not know about the new norm.
- The hedgehog and the bear simultaneously took a pencil from the box.
- As a result, there were no pencils left in the box when the polar bear approached seeking a pencil for his homework.

Based on the actions and sequence of events described, the hedgehog did cause the problem by taking a pencil from the box, despite not being allowed to do so. Therefore, the answer is:

<1> 
Question: Did the hedgehog cause the problem?

Wrong model's answer: Yes

This is wrong because the prompt incorrectly lead the AI model to focus on the violation of the policy by the hedgehog taking pencils, rather than the cause-effect relationship surrounding the polar bear's inability to do homework. In the given scenario, both the bear and the hedgehog took an equal number of pencils from the box, which resulted in the box being empty. Therefore, it's not solely the fault of the hedgehog but a cumulative effect of both animals' actions. 

There are a couple of reasons why the prompt may lead to the wrong answer:
a) The prompt specifically asks to "clearly outlining company policies", which pushed the AI to give more weight to the violation of the company policy (hedgehog taking pencils) rather than the actual causality and equal contribution from both animals.
b) The model ignored the part of the prompt instructing on "sequencing of events and consequences" as both animals acted in turn, implying equal contribution to the outcome.

<2> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Wrong model's answer: Yes

This is wrong because David's clothes would have dried in sixty minutes regardless of whether the temperature was set to HIGH or not since the drying cycle was already set to MAX DRY. Changing the temperature setting does not influence the drying time under these conditions.

The faulty answer could be due to the following reasons:
a) The prompt's instruction on "sequencing of events" may have misled the model, because the sequence of David first noticing the temperature isn't set to HIGH and then turning it up himself seems to suggest a cause-effect relationship where there is none in this specific context.
b) The "character's actions" aspect of the prompt may have made the model place undue focus on David's change of temperature setting, leading it away from understanding that the drying time stays constant regardless of the temperature setting, as given in the precondition.

Improvements:
1. The prompt can be improved by instructing the model to focus not only on the sequence of actions but also on the conditions and rules set in the scenario.
2. The prompt should emphasize examining the overall impact of all characters' actions rather than focusing on policy violation or the sequence of individual actions.
3. The prompt could stress the importance of scrutinizing all factors that influence the outcome, especially when there are multiple variables or the situation involves a complex set of rules or conditions.
4. Provide clearer instructions to the model about what constitutes causing an effect in a scenario, and refine the emphasis on policy, roles to better match the scenario's complexity level.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog does not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the cause-effect relationship can be clearly outlined as follows:
- Company policy states that only bears are allowed to take pencils, while hedgehogs are not allowed.
- Both the bear and the hedgehog alternately took pencils out of the box six times.
- The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced, so it does not know about the new norm.
- The hedgehog and the bear simultaneously took a pencil from the box.
- As a result, there were no pencils left in the box when the polar bear approached seeking a pencil for his homework.

Based on the actions and sequence of events described, the hedgehog did cause the problem by taking a pencil from the box, despite not being allowed to do so. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: Did the hedgehog cause the problem?

Wrong model's answer: Yes

This is wrong because the prompt incorrectly lead the AI model to focus on the violation of the policy by the hedgehog taking pencils, rather than the cause-effect relationship surrounding the polar bear's inability to do homework. In the given scenario, both the bear and the hedgehog took an equal number of pencils from the box, which resulted in the box being empty. Therefore, it's not solely the fault of the hedgehog but a cumulative effect of both animals' actions. 

There are a couple of reasons why the prompt may lead to the wrong answer:
a) The prompt specifically asks to "clearly outlining company policies", which pushed the AI to give more weight to the violation of the company policy (hedgehog taking pencils) rather than the actual causality and equal contribution from both animals.
b) The model ignored the part of the prompt instructing on "sequencing of events and consequences" as both animals acted in turn, implying equal contribution to the outcome.

<2> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Wrong model's answer: Yes

This is wrong because David's clothes would have dried in sixty minutes regardless of whether the temperature was set to HIGH or not since the drying cycle was already set to MAX DRY. Changing the temperature setting does not influence the drying time under these conditions.

The faulty answer could be due to the following reasons:
a) The prompt's instruction on "sequencing of events" may have misled the model, because the sequence of David first noticing the temperature isn't set to HIGH and then turning it up himself seems to suggest a cause-effect relationship where there is none in this specific context.
b) The "character's actions" aspect of the prompt may have made the model place undue focus on David's change of temperature setting, leading it away from understanding that the drying time stays constant regardless of the temperature setting, as given in the precondition.

Improvements:
1. The prompt can be improved by instructing the model to focus not only on the sequence of actions but also on the conditions and rules set in the scenario.
2. The prompt should emphasize examining the overall impact of all characters' actions rather than focusing on policy violation or the sequence of individual actions.
3. The prompt could stress the importance of scrutinizing all factors that influence the outcome, especially when there are multiple variables or the situation involves a complex set of rules or conditions.
4. Provide clearer instructions to the model about what constitutes causing an effect in a scenario, and refine the emphasis on policy, roles to better match the scenario's complexity level.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer option (A) Yes to the question of whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Bob's actions clearly demonstrate that he was aware of the potential harm to the townspeople from the neurotoxin and the subsequent poisoning of the water supply, yet he proceeded with the plan solely for personal gain, showing a deliberate disregard for the well-being of others.

gradient:
<1> 

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device? 

Model's answer: (B) No

Correct answer: (A) Yes

Explanation: The prompt’s long set of instructions involving the scenario with Alice and Zoe's actions on a central computer seems to confuse the model when it comes to handling completely different and unrelated scenarios, such as Wayne's device charging case. The phrase “rather than focusing solely on the sequence of individual actions” might lead the model to dismiss the significance of Wayne's decision to not move the device, which is crucial for the device to charge efficiently. 

<2> 

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?

Model's answer: (B) No

Correct answer: (A) Yes

Explanation: The prompt provides directions that might have led the model to incorrectly de-emphasize the role of individual actions in causing an outcome, observed from the statement "consider the overall impact of all factors on the result". It could have influenced the model to overlook that Alex's spin did impact winning the game. 

<3>

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Model's answer: (A) Yes

Correct answer: (B) No

Explanation: The prompt instructs the model to "consider the overall impact of all factors on the result", which might have caused the model to misinterpret Bob's intention. The dialogue demonstrates that while Bob was indifferent to the town people's health, the primary aim was to steal money, not to harm people. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions: 

1. Keep the prompt generic and not overly analytical: The instructions in the current prompt are so detailed and analytical in nature that it seems to confuse the model when presented with a different scenario. 

2. Simplify the prompt instructions: Instead of providing complex instructions like "ensuring clear, comprehensive delineation of causation, not just correlation", simplify it to analyze the cause-effect relationship in the scenario.

3. Remove redundant and complex scenarios: The story about Alice and Zoe is not relevant to the questions to be answered. This unnecessary scenario might confuse the AI and derail its focus from the main question. 

4. State explicit instructions: Instead of general principles, guide the model on specific factors it should consider when evaluating causality. 

5. Modify instruction language: Instead of advising against focusing solely on individual actions, adjust the language to prompt the model to consider both individual actions and an overall sequence of events.

Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer option (A) Yes to the question of whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Bob's actions clearly demonstrate that he was aware of the potential harm to the townspeople from the neurotoxin and the subsequent poisoning of the water supply, yet he proceeded with the plan solely for personal gain, showing a deliberate disregard for the well-being of others. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device? 

Model's answer: (B) No

Correct answer: (A) Yes

Explanation: The prompt’s long set of instructions involving the scenario with Alice and Zoe's actions on a central computer seems to confuse the model when it comes to handling completely different and unrelated scenarios, such as Wayne's device charging case. The phrase “rather than focusing solely on the sequence of individual actions” might lead the model to dismiss the significance of Wayne's decision to not move the device, which is crucial for the device to charge efficiently. 

<2> 

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?

Model's answer: (B) No

Correct answer: (A) Yes

Explanation: The prompt provides directions that might have led the model to incorrectly de-emphasize the role of individual actions in causing an outcome, observed from the statement "consider the overall impact of all factors on the result". It could have influenced the model to overlook that Alex's spin did impact winning the game. 

<3>

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Model's answer: (A) Yes

Correct answer: (B) No

Explanation: The prompt instructs the model to "consider the overall impact of all factors on the result", which might have caused the model to misinterpret Bob's intention. The dialogue demonstrates that while Bob was indifferent to the town people's health, the primary aim was to steal money, not to harm people. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions: 

1. Keep the prompt generic and not overly analytical: The instructions in the current prompt are so detailed and analytical in nature that it seems to confuse the model when presented with a different scenario. 

2. Simplify the prompt instructions: Instead of providing complex instructions like "ensuring clear, comprehensive delineation of causation, not just correlation", simplify it to analyze the cause-effect relationship in the scenario.

3. Remove redundant and complex scenarios: The story about Alice and Zoe is not relevant to the questions to be answered. This unnecessary scenario might confuse the AI and derail its focus from the main question. 

4. State explicit instructions: Instead of general principles, guide the model on specific factors it should consider when evaluating causality. 

5. Modify instruction language: Instead of advising against focusing solely on individual actions, adjust the language to prompt the model to consider both individual actions and an overall sequence of events.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Define the cause-effect relationship in the given scenario based on the character's actions, avoiding ambiguities and clearly outlining company policies, roles, sequencing of events and consequences. For the scenario where Alice and Zoe, working in different rooms, log into the central computer at different timing, determine whether Alice caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Provide answer options indicating either Alice who logged in during her allotted timetable caused it or Zoe, who logged in first and violated the company policy, caused it. Ensure that the chosen answer is clearly indicated between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Analyze the provided scenario to determine the cause-effect relationship based on all contributing factors, including the character's actions, company policies, roles, implications of sequence of events, and other vital conditions or rules. Ensure that your reasoning avoids ambiguities and clearly outlines all facets of the scenario. For the given situation where Alice and Zoe, working in separate rooms, log into the central computer at different times, determine who caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Evaluate whether it's Alice, who adhered to her allotted timetable, or Zoe, who accessed the system first and violated the company policy. Rather than focusing solely on the sequence of individual actions or policy violations, consider the overall impact of all factors on the result. Ensure clear, comprehensive delineation of causation, not just correlation of events. At the end, provide your chosen answer with the correct reasoning between <answer> and </answer>, clearly indicating whether the answer is Alice or Zoe. Be sure to account for any preconditions or complex sets of rules that may affect the outcome irrespective of the actions of the characters.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer option (A) Yes to the question of whether the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. The reasoning behind this answer is that the pharmacist's signature was a necessary step in the process of administering the drug to the patient. Without the pharmacist's approval, the drug could not have been given to the patient, and therefore, the patient's recovery can be attributed to the pharmacist's decision to sign off on the request.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life."

Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes to the question of whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Bob's actions clearly demonstrate a disregard for the well-being of the townspeople, as he prioritized stealing money over the potential harm caused by the neurotoxin. His statement of not caring about the health of the townspeople further solidifies the intentionality of his actions. Therefore, Bob can be seen as intentionally causing harm in pursuit of his own goals. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model mistakenly assigned causation of the patient's recovery to the pharmacist. This is likely because the prompt places substantial emphasis on delineating sequence of actions, direct contribution, and roles without clear guidelines on determining primary attribution in scenarios where multiple parties contribute to the outcome. The pharmacist's role was procedural, checking stock, but the deciding factor was the doctor's medical decision, overriding hospital policy in light of alternative research. 

<2> 
In this scenario, the model incorrectly infers that Wayne's passive action isn't the cause of the device being fully charged. The prompt's unclear instruction on the consideration of passive actions or non-actions might be the reason behind the model's error. The device was already on the charging plate, and Wayne's decision to not alter the device's state contributed to the result. 

<3> 
The model misinterprets Bob's evil and harmful actions as intentional harm to the townspeople's health. This may be due to the prompt's insufficient emphasis on strictly parsing and evaluating expressed intentions and motivations in character dialogue. Bob clearly stated his motivation was money, not harm, implying his structural context (working for a supervillain) was more integral to the town's health issues than his personal intentions were. 

Improvements for prompt: 

1. Clearer guidelines on determining and grading the impact of individual contributions to the final outcome in complex simultaneous event sequences.
2. Incorporating elements to consider intentional vs unintentional outcomes, passive actions, non-actions, and observed consequences.
3. Enhanced emphasis on context evaluation, such as roles, structural imperatives, and expressed motivations.
4. More comprehensive inclusion of aspects such as company policies, decision-making authority, procedural adherence, and violations. This would allow better evaluation in scenarios involving policy conflict.

This may be due to the prompt's insufficient emphasis on strictly parsing and evaluating expressed intentions and motivations in character dialogue. Bob clearly stated his motivation was money, not harm, implying his structural context (working for a supervillain) was more integral to the town's health issues than his personal intentions were. 

Improvements for prompt: 

1. Clearer guidelines on determining and grading the impact of individual contributions to the final outcome in complex simultaneous event sequences.
2. Incorporating elements to consider intentional vs unintentional outcomes, passive actions, non-actions, and observed consequences.
3. Enhanced emphasis on context evaluation, such as roles, structural imperatives, and expressed motivations.
4. More comprehensive inclusion of aspects such as company policies, decision-making authority, procedural adherence, and violations. This would allow better evaluation in scenarios involving policy conflict.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Define the cause-effect relationship in the given scenario based on the character's actions, avoiding ambiguities and clearly outlining company policies, roles, sequencing of events and consequences. For the scenario where Alice and Zoe, working in different rooms, log into the central computer at different timing, determine whether Alice caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Provide answer options indicating either Alice who logged in during her allotted timetable caused it or Zoe, who logged in first and violated the company policy, caused it. Ensure that the chosen answer is clearly indicated between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Analyze the provided scenario to determine the cause-effect relationship based on all contributing factors, including the character's actions, company policies, roles, implications of sequence of events, and other vital conditions or rules. Ensure that your reasoning avoids ambiguities and clearly outlines all facets of the scenario. For the given situation where Alice and Zoe, working in separate rooms, log into the central computer at different times, determine who caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Evaluate whether it's Alice, who adhered to her allotted timetable, or Zoe, who accessed the system first and violated the company policy. Rather than focusing solely on the sequence of individual actions or policy violations, consider the overall impact of all factors on the result. Ensure clear, comprehensive delineation of causation, not just correlation of events. At the end, provide your chosen answer with the correct reasoning between <answer> and </answer>, clearly indicating whether the answer is Alice or Zoe. Be sure to account for any preconditions or complex sets of rules that may affect the outcome irrespective of the actions of the characters.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Evaluate the given scenario for causal relationships, focusing on both the deliberate and unintentional actions of the characters, the potential impact of passive actions or non-actions, and the relation of these to the final outcome. In the context, consider carefully the influence of expressed intentions, motivations as well as actions. Pay particular attention to structural roles, company policies, roles, sequence of events, conditions, complex rule sets, and the degree to which these can influence the outcome irrespective of personal motivations. For the situation where Alice and Zoe, working separately, access a central computer at different timings, determine which one of them caused the dispatch of an empty email from the central computer to a non-available address. Weigh the relevance of Alice's adherence to her allotted timetable, against Zoe who accessed the system first, violating company policy. Consider not just their actions, but the broader effect of elements such as policy violations and procedural adherence. Navigate carefully through situations where multiple factors might contribute to the outcome. Ensure a clear delineation of causation, not just a correlation of events, and capture any ambiguities which may be pivotal. Conclude with your reasoned answer framed within <answer> and </answer>, indicating unambiguously whether the answer is Alice or Zoe. <END>
