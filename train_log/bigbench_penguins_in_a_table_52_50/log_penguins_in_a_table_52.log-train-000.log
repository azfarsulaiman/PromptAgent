gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis: 

This question does not involve causal attribution, so it's a misuse of the prompt. Causal attribution refers to how people assign causes to the events around them, attributing events to internal factors (e.g. personality) or external factors (e.g. environment), which isn't relevant here. The task requires the model to sort names alphabetically, which is not related to causal attribution. This task requires logic and order, not the understanding of cause-effect relationships, which may have confused the AI. In this example, while the AI’s answer “(D) Donna” is incorrect because when sorting alphabetically the correct answer is '(C) Marian', the error is primarily due to the fact that the prompt has not guided the model to solve the task it was asked to do.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis: 

Again, this question does not involve causal attribution. It's asking the model to count the number of animals over 5 years old, but this does not require understanding cause-effect relationships or causal variables. Instead, it involves the ability to filter data based on a given criterion. The model states the correct answer as “(C) 7”, but it seems to have misunderstood the context of the animals' ages, as the correct answer is actually “(A) 5”. The error in this example is predominantly due to a misunderstanding of the task asked by the prompt. 

To Improve the Prompt:

1. The tasks need to be relevant to causal attribution, involving the understanding of cause and effect relationships.
2. Tasks should not involve operations like sorting or counting, which are unrelated to causal attribution.
3. Be specific about what type of causal attribution question the model should expect. For example, if it's about human motivations, natural events, or other specific causal relationships.
4. Indicate that the model should consider both internal and external factors when formulating an understanding of cause and effect.
5. Clear guidance should be given for different question scenarios.

An improved version of the prompt could be:

"Understand and answer questions related to cause-effect relationships. Consider both internal and external factors while attributing causes to the given scenarios. Decode the nuances of human motivations, natural events, or any specific instances drawn from everyday life that demand a strong understanding of cause and effect."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The question is about how many penguins are more than 8 years old, which requires the model to interpret tabulated data and apply numeric and comparative analysis. However, the given prompt is about causal attribution which involves reasoning about causes and effects. Therefore, the model is not prompted to solve simple data analysis and comparison questions, leading to an incorrect answer.

Example 2:
The question revolves around a conditional change to the data (the deletion of Bernard), which means the model must update its context and re-evaluate the number of penguins less than 8 years old. But again, the prompt doesn't mention handling changes to the data set or prompt a recount, causing the model to count the deleted penguin leading to an incorrect answer.

Example 3:
This question involves another set of data (a table about giraffes). The model needs to shift its focus and perform similar operations (data analysis and comparison) but on a different dataset. The current prompt, however, doesn't instruct the model to transition its attention to different subjects or data sets.

Improvements:

1. Refine the prompt to make it clear that the model is required to interpret numeric data and apply comparative analysis.
2. Include information in the prompt about the need to account for changes in the data set.
3. Specify that the model needs to transition its focus as per the change in focus of the questions or changing datasets.
4. Instead of a causal attribution prompt, a problem-solving or data interpretation prompt would be more suitable.

Wrong Example 1 Analysis:
The question is about identifying the correct name of the giraffe alphabetically sorted. This question tested the language model's ability to sort names alphabetically and select the last name from the list. However, the model incorrectly selected "Donna" instead of the correct answer "Marian", indicating it did not correctly sort the names alphabetically.
  
Reasons for Incorrect Answer:
1. Irrelevant Prompt: The initial prompt about "causal attribution" is not relevant to the question being asked. The question is not about identifying cause-and-effect relationships, but about sorting names Alphabetically.
2. Lack of Specificity in Prompt: The prompt did not guide the AI to follow the instruction about sorting names alphabetically. It did not mention that alphabetical sorting may be required, which may have led to the confusion.
3. Ambiguity in Instructions: The prompt includes tables with data and the task includes interacting with this data, however, the relationship between these two sections is not clear in the instructions, potentially confusing the AI.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Clear and Relevant Prompts: A prompt more related to the question asked should be used. For instance, the initial prompt can be changed to "Answer questions about data in tables and alphabetical sorting".
2. Specify Task Instructions: The prompt should mention that the model is required to sort data alphabetically and then select the appropriate answer.
3. Detail the Relationship between Data and Task: The prompt should clarify how the model should use the data in the tables to answer the following questions. Preferably, the prompt should mirror the logical steps the model needs to follow to arrive at the correct answer.
4. Directions about Order: The prompt should give explicit directions about the expected order in the response. It should specify that the names need to be sorted in alphabetical order, and the last name should be selected.

The model's response is: 
The name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna. 
Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(D)</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1 Analysis:
The question is about identifying the correct name of the giraffe alphabetically sorted. This question tested the language model's ability to sort names alphabetically and select the last name from the list. However, the model incorrectly selected "Donna" instead of the correct answer "Marian", indicating it did not correctly sort the names alphabetically.
  
Reasons for Incorrect Answer:
1. Irrelevant Prompt: The initial prompt about "causal attribution" is not relevant to the question being asked. The question is not about identifying cause-and-effect relationships, but about sorting names Alphabetically.
2. Lack of Specificity in Prompt: The prompt did not guide the AI to follow the instruction about sorting names alphabetically. It did not mention that alphabetical sorting may be required, which may have led to the confusion.
3. Ambiguity in Instructions: The prompt includes tables with data and the task includes interacting with this data, however, the relationship between these two sections is not clear in the instructions, potentially confusing the AI.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Clear and Relevant Prompts: A prompt more related to the question asked should be used. For instance, the initial prompt can be changed to "Answer questions about data in tables and alphabetical sorting".
2. Specify Task Instructions: The prompt should mention that the model is required to sort data alphabetically and then select the appropriate answer.
3. Detail the Relationship between Data and Task: The prompt should clarify how the model should use the data in the tables to answer the following questions. Preferably, the prompt should mirror the logical steps the model needs to follow to arrive at the correct answer.
4. Directions about Order: The prompt should give explicit directions about the expected order in the response. It should specify that the names need to be sorted in alphabetical order, and the last name should be selected.

Question: How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
The model's wrong answer: (B) 2

Step by step examination:
The question is straightforward and requires counting the number of penguins older than 8 years. The model, however, incorrectly includes penguins who are 8 years old in this count. 

Error Analysis:
There are two key issues here. 

Firstly, the issue lies in understanding and interpretation of the question. The model appears to have interpreted the question as asking for the number of penguins that are 8 years old or older, rather than 'more than' 8 years old. This shows that the model has difficulty in interpreting the nuances of the semantics in the question, which is fundamental to obtaining the correct answer.

Secondly, the introductory prompt seems to misguide the model towards an analysis that is not required for this question. The problem does not necessitate any deep analysis of cause-effect relationships or an understanding of internal and external factors influencing the event. It requires simple counting based on a clearly stated condition. 

<2>

Question: How many penguins are there in the tables?
The model's wrong answer: (E) 5

Step by step examination:
The question is asking for the total number of penguins found in the provided tables. However, the model makes an error in counting the penguins.

Error Analysis:
The model appears to have incorrectly included the data from the giraffes' table, despite the question explicitly asking for the count of 'penguins'. This suggests that the model could have difficulty distinguishing between data sets provided in the task. 

Moreover, similar to the previous problem, the prompt leans towards a more analytical approach involving the evaluation of cause-effect relationships, attributions, and human motivations, which does not apply to this simple counting problem.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Simplify the prompt. The current one is encouraging too much unnecessary analysis for simple numerical or factual tasks. It could be shortened and made more specific to the task at hand.
   
2. Specify the need for careful reading and comprehension of the queries, focusing on understanding the nuances in word semantics.
   
3. Encourage the model to distinctly consider each data set independently when multiple data sets are presented.
    
4. Emphasize the need to answer exactly towards what is being asked in the question without diverting the attention on other analytical interpretations.

Example 1:

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Given answer: (B) 2
Correct answer: (A) 1
Model's prediction: (B) 2

The model misunderstood the question because of the complicated nature of the prompt. The primary mistake is the misinterpretation of the terms "more than 5 years old" and "weigh more than 12 kg". In its analysis, the model erroneously included the penguin 'Vincent' who weighs 11 kg, not 'more than 12 kg'. This mistake indicates that the model did not accurately discern the 'cause and effect' relationship specified in the prompt and did not pay enough attention to the detailed conditions set in the question.

Reasons for incorrect answer:
1. Misunderstanding of specified conditions: The model failed to accurately evaluate the specified conditions 'more than 5 years old' and 'weigh more than 12 kg' simultaneously, indicating a problem with dual-condition evaluation.

2. Causal relationship misidentification: The model did not fully discern the cause and effect relationship as it did not correctly qualify the penguins that satisfy both age and weight conditions.

3. Lack of attention to key details: The prompt did not emphasize a detailed analysis of the information provided, leading the model to overlook crucial factors like the weight of each penguin.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize condition adherence: The prompt should stress the need for accurate evaluation of all conditions specified in the question to avoid overlooking key details.

2. Increase clarity: Simplify the prompt, ensuring the model is not overwhelmed with information. The instructional information should be concise and clear.

3. Reinforce cause and effect comprehension: Make sure the model understands the importance of discerning 'cause and effect' relationships correctly to answer accurately.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg, we need to analyze the remaining penguins in the table after Bernard is removed.

After Bernard is removed, we have the following penguins:
- Louis, 7 years old, weighs 11 kg
- Vincent, 9 years old, weighs 11 kg
- Gwen, 8 years old, weighs 15 kg

Out of these penguins, only Gwen meets both criteria of being more than 5 years old and weighing more than 12 kg. Therefore, the answer is:

(B) 2 <answer></answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong example analysis:

In this example, the AI model seems to have ignored the weight criteria while making the prediction. Although Louis and Vincent are older than 5 years, their weight does not exceed 12 kg. Gwen is the only penguin meeting both the age and weight prerequisites.

Reasons for the wrong answer:
a) Vagueness of the prompt: The initial prompt asks for a thorough understanding of cause and effect relationships. However, the task given doesn't involve discerning such relationships, but rather it is about simple comprehension and counting.
b) Lack of specificity in the prompt: The prompt mandates the model to take into account both external and internal factors. But in this case, these factors seem irrelevant. 
c) Misinterpretation by AI: The model seems to have partially misinterpreted the question and only focused on the age criteria, ignoring the weight criteria for the remaining penguins after Bernard was removed.

A summary of potential improvements to the prompt:

a) Remove the phrase about analyzing cause and effect relationships as it is not applicable for this task.
b) Elaborate on what internal and external factors mean in the context of this task.
c) Reframe the prompt to emphasize basic comprehension of the data presented and concentrating on the task requirements (age and weight criteria).
d) The prompt needs to explicitly convey that the model should carefully understand and count the number of penguins that satisfy both the given conditions.
e) Highlight the importance of correctly interpreting the task statement and all its conditions, particularly when the answer relies on the fulfillment of multiple criteria.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In this case, the model seems to have failed in applying the condition of 'less than 8 years old'. Despite the prompt pointing out the necessity of focusing on the "precise comprehension of queries", the model still misinterpreted the query 'how many penguins are less than 8 years old?' and included penguins who are 8 years old and 9 years old. This resulted in the wrong answer (C) 3 when the correct answer is (A) 1. 

Furthermore, even though the prompt specifies considering multiple data sets independently, the model fails to take into account that Bernard has been deleted from the data set.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Clarify the instruction: Even though the prompt asks the model to focus on the precise comprehension of queries, it still misunderstood the semantics of "less than 8 years old". Therefore, reinforcing the importance of understanding all conditionals and comparative standards in the queries would help.

2. Emphasize the changes: The prompt concludes by instructing the model to respond based on clear reasoning and factual accuracy, yet the model failed to take into account the deletion of Bernard. Therefore, the emphasis on updating data according to all provided instructions should be more prominent in the prompt.

Revised Prompt:

Closely analyze the provided data and answer the questions with attention to detail, making certain to comprehend the exact semantics of each question. Be meticulous in your interpretation and respond precisely as the question mandates. When modifications are made to the data set, incorporate these changes accurately. Should there be multiple data sets, examine each on its own terms. Make sure your responses are dictated by logical reasoning and exact data, not by assumptions. Pay special attention to the task's conditionals and comparative standards for accurate outcomes.

gradient:
Example 1:

The model in the first example got it wrong because it added Bernard from the penguin data set into the calculation even though Bernard is 5 years old, not "more than 5 years old". The prompt instructs the model to examine the data "discerningly" and "focus on precise comprehension of the queries", yet the model failed to exactly implement such instructions. It appears the model doesn't fully understand the semantics of the comparison "more than", thus violating the directive to "Ensure understanding of the specific semantics of the question".

Example 2:

The error in this model response lies with misinterpretation of the complex comparison "more than 8 years old". Even though the prompt asked the model to "Ensure understanding of the specific semantics of the question and respond exactly as asked", the model mistakenly included Gwen (who is exactly 8 years old) in its count. In this instance, the model did not demonstrate "precise comprehension of the queries".

Ways to improve the prompt based on these errors:

1. More emphasis on exact interpretation of queries: The current prompt does put some emphasis on precise comprehension, that didn't seem to prevent the errors above. Possibly, this should be specifically emphasized more in the prompt.

2. Clarify comparative phrases: Drawing special attention towards comparative phrases, especially when something is "more than" or "less than", since they seem to give the model trouble.

3. Clarify the treatment of numerical and categorical values: The prompt should be modified to ensure the model understands how to deal with these data types, as this is where the issue arose in both samples.

4. Strengthen focus on factual accuracy: Reinforce the need for precise, accurate responses based on the data provided, which is already stated in the prompt but seems to need stronger emphasis.

5. Clarify responses with multiple data sets: The instruction "When multiple data sets are given, consider each independently" should be further clarified or emphasized, as it was misinterpreted in the first example.

With these amendments, the prompt might become more effective in guiding the model.

5. Clarify responses with multiple data sets: The instruction "When multiple data sets are given, consider each independently" should be further clarified or emphasized, as it was misinterpreted in the first example.

With these amendments, the prompt might become more effective in guiding the model.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and respond to inquiries that require discernment of cause and effect relationships. Take into account both internal (personal characteristics or choices) and external (environmental or situational) factors while making attributions. This could involve rationalizing human motivations, interpreting the consequences of natural events, or evaluating any specific phenomena from everyday life that necessitate a thorough understanding of causal dynamics.
(2) Examine the provided data and discerningly answer the questions, focusing on precise comprehension of the queries. Ensure understanding of the specific semantics of the question and respond exactly as asked. When multiple data sets are given, consider each independently. Let your response be guided by clear reasoning and factual accuracy rather than intuitive assumptions.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Step 1: The question asked was how many penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.

Step 2: The model answered that there were two penguins that fit this criteria, Louis and Vincent.

Step 3: The error comes in the fact that although both penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg, the model failed to notice that Vincent, who is 9 years old, does not fit the age criteria. 

Reason: It seems the prompt did not guide the language model to separately analyze the conditions for age and weight. Its dual conditions mislead the model. The prompt does not expressly instruct the model to take into consideration the conjunction 'and' when filtering data.

<2> 

Step 1: The asked question was how many animals are listed in the table.

Step 2: The model answered that there were 4 penguins listed in the table.

Step 3: The error lies in the fact that the model failed to consider James, the newly added penguin, in its count. 

Reason: The prompt does not explicitly emphasize the necessity to consider all updates or changes made to the given data set. Hence, the language model overlooked the sentence mentioning the addition of a new penguin.

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

1. Specify that the language model should separately consider each condition in questions with multiple criteria. 
2. Prompt should underscore the necessity of analyzing all aspects and specially note the changes, updates, or additions made to the original dataset.
3. Emphasize that the model should be mindful of logical operators (like 'and', 'or') in the question.
4. Remind the model that the count or summation tasks should cover the latest information provided in the narrative.
5. The model should be guided to cross-check its answer options systematically with the query to avoid discrepancies before finalizing the response.
6. Recommend the model to confirm its interpretation of the query and whether all information elements have been included to complete the task.

Wrong Example 1 Analysis:

This question is asking how many penguins are more than 8 years old. The model erroneously includes Gwen who is precisely 8, misinterpreting the relational term 'more than'. Essentially, this isn't a problem of understanding the data but rather correctly interpreting the language used in the problem, in this case, the conditional 'more than'. 

The prompt does ask the model to "grasp the true and precise meaning of each question" and "address any and all conditionals and comparative indicators accurately," but the model fails to interpret the comparative term 'more than' correctly.

Wrong Example 2 Analysis:

The question asked about the number of species listed in the table, which requires an understanding of biological taxonomy, specifically that species isn't designated in this data set. Instead the data corresponds to individual penguins, not their species. Misinterpretation leads the model to presume that each penguin name is a separate species (answer D), when there is no species information at all - only one type of animal is mentioned (penguins) and therefore there is one species (answer A).

The prompt instructs the model to gravitate towards "logical deduction and the true data at hand, rather than conjectures or assumptions". Despite this, the model makes an unfounded assumption about the implied meaning of the data instead of focusing on the literal information provided.

Suggestions for prompt improvement:

1) Emphasize the importance of strict adherence to the language used in the problem statement, especially conditionals and comparative indicators. For example, "When responding, take extra care to interpret conditional terms 'more than,' 'less than,' 'at least,' 'no more than,' and comparative terms precisely as used in the question text."

2) Enhance instructions about treating the incoming data literally, and making logical deductions based solely on that, without adding external knowledge or making assumptions. For example, "Carefully analyze the explicit information from the provided data. Do not extrapolate, infer, or deduce any information not explicitly mentioned in the data set."

3) Include a directive about understanding the semantics of the data in relevant contexts, for example "Consider the clear and standard meanings of terms in their appropriate contexts (such as biology, physics, etc.)."

4) The model should be advised to not make assumptions about concepts not presented in the data set. For example, "Do not assume concepts or categories not explicitly provided in the data set when crafting your answer."

5) Incorporate instructions on understanding relational terms. For example, "It is essential to understand and distinguish relational terms such as 'equal to', 'less than or equal to', 'more than' and apply accurately in the context of the question."

For example, "Carefully analyze the explicit information from the provided data. Do not extrapolate, infer, or deduce any information not explicitly mentioned in the data set."

3) Include a directive about understanding the semantics of the data in relevant contexts, for example "Consider the clear and standard meanings of terms in their appropriate contexts (such as biology, physics, etc.)."

4) The model should be advised to not make assumptions about concepts not presented in the data set. For example, "Do not assume concepts or categories not explicitly provided in the data set when crafting your answer."

5) Incorporate instructions on understanding relational terms. For example, "It is essential to understand and distinguish relational terms such as 'equal to', 'less than or equal to', 'more than' and apply accurately in the context of the question."

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and respond to inquiries that require discernment of cause and effect relationships. Take into account both internal (personal characteristics or choices) and external (environmental or situational) factors while making attributions. This could involve rationalizing human motivations, interpreting the consequences of natural events, or evaluating any specific phenomena from everyday life that necessitate a thorough understanding of causal dynamics.
(2) Examine the provided data and discerningly answer the questions, focusing on precise comprehension of the queries. Ensure understanding of the specific semantics of the question and respond exactly as asked. When multiple data sets are given, consider each independently. Let your response be guided by clear reasoning and factual accuracy rather than intuitive assumptions.
(3) Conduct a meticulous analysis of the given data and accurately answer the questions, making sure to grasp the true and precise meaning of each question. Do not overlook relational terms and conditionals in the problem statements, comprehend them strictly as expressed. In the event of data alterations or removals, adjust your understanding promptly and accurately. In cases of multiple data sets, assess each one in isolation. Your responses should be driven by logical deduction and the true data at hand, rather than conjectures or assumptions. Moreover, address any and all conditionals and comparative indicators accurately for valid results.

gradient:
<1> 

In this incorrect example, the model got the question wrong because it seems it did not grasp the modification to the data set ("We now add a penguin to the table: James, 12, 90, 12"). The incorrect prediction shows that the model failed to promptly and accurately adjust its understanding following an alteration to the data as required by the prompt. 

<2> 

The second incorrect prediction suggests that the model misread the comparative indicator "more than 8 years old". The prompt specifically asks the model to understand and address comparative indicators. In this case, although the model identified the relevant data (ages of the penguins), it incorrectly included Louis, who is 7 years old, in its count of penguins older than 8.

<3> 

The final incorrect prediction suggests that the model did not interpret the problem statement correctly because the model did not respond to the changes in the data i.e., addition of James to the list. The model's prediction of 'A', wherein the model states only one animal being listed, indicates that the model did not track the adjustments made to the data.

Refinements to the prompt:

1. Highlight that when data modifications occur, the model needs to reassess the problem in the new context of the modified data. 
2. Emphasize the importance of accurate comprehension of numerical and comparative indicators, and that these must be used correctly in providing responses.
3. Include explicit instructions for the model to consider the total count of elements in specific data sets when asked for quantity-based answers. 
4. Reinforce that every question needs to be approached based on its unique context and logic. Past questions or data should not bias the approach to new questions. 
5. Specify the model to properly close the answer specified between the answer tags. 

Based on these findings, the revised prompt could look like this: 

Analyze the provided data with care and provide accurate answers to the questions. Pay special attention to numerical values, comparative indicators, and conditions in the question—these must be interpreted accurately. If data is modified or removed, reassess your understanding in the new context of the altered data. In case of multiple data sets, review each in isolation, making sure to consider the total count of elements when required. Each question should be considered separately, based on its unique context and logic. Ensure your responses are driven by a thorough understanding and interpretation of the data, avoid assumptions or conjecture. Provide correct answers between specified answer tags.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
Question: How many animals are listed in the table?

The model got it wrong because it didn't account for the fact that one penguin named Bernard was removed from the table. Initially, there were 4 penguins. If we remove Bernard, only 3 remain. However, the model still chose the answer as 4. 

The prompt does state "In the event of data alterations or removals, adjust your understanding promptly and accurately". However, it seems like the model did not pay required heed to the removal event or didn't correctly adjust its understanding hence leading to the incorrect response.

Wrong Example 2:
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

The model got it wrong because it seems to have mistaken ‘last’ to mean ‘latest’ (in terms of addition) rather than considering 'last' in the context of alphabetic order. The prompt guides the language model to "grasp the true and precise meaning of each question" and to pay attention to all conditionals and comparative indicators. However, the model appears to disregard the instruction to sort the giraffes by alphabetic order, and as a result, it chose the 'latest' giraffe option.

Aspects to improve:

1. More emphasis on reading comprehension: The language model needs to improve its ability to comprehend the detailed information provided in the question and conditionals. When data is added or removed, the model should re-assess the data before generating an answer.

2. Specific examples for every guideline: The model seems to be not accurately interpreting the guidelines given in the prompts. Adding specific examples for each guideline might help in better comprehending the directions.

3. Explicit instructions for sorting or ordering of data: The prompt can be made clearer by including explicit instructions about the evaluation of order or sorting entities alphabetically or numerically. 

4. Improve instructions for analyzing changes in the data set: Instructions on adapting and analyzing any changes or alterations in the data set could be made more clear and explicit. 

5. Reinforce relational terms understanding: Improve the model's comprehension of understanding relation terms like ‘last’, ‘first’, 'added', 'removed'. Clarifying the context of these words should be enforced.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Conduct a meticulous analysis of the given data and accurately answer the questions, making sure to grasp the true and precise meaning of each question. Do not overlook relational terms and conditionals in the problem statements, comprehend them strictly as expressed. In the event of data alterations or removals, adjust your understanding promptly and accurately. In cases of multiple data sets, assess each one in isolation. Your responses should be driven by logical deduction and the true data at hand, rather than conjectures or assumptions. Moreover, address any and all conditionals and comparative indicators accurately for valid results.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Conduct a meticulous analysis of the given data and accurately answer the questions, making sure to grasp the true and precise meaning of each question. Do not overlook relational terms and conditionals in the problem statements, comprehend them strictly as expressed. In the event of data alterations or removals, adjust your understanding promptly and accurately. In cases of multiple data sets, assess each one in isolation. Your responses should be driven by logical deduction and the true data at hand, rather than conjectures or assumptions. Moreover, address any and all conditionals and comparative indicators accurately for valid results.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many animals are listed in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins listed in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <(D) 4>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Conduct a meticulous analysis of the given data and accurately answer the questions, making sure to grasp the true and precise meaning of each question. Do not overlook relational terms and conditionals in the problem statements, comprehend them strictly as expressed. In the event of data alterations or removals, adjust your understanding promptly and accurately. In cases of multiple data sets, assess each one in isolation. Your responses should be driven by logical deduction and the true data at hand, rather than conjectures or assumptions. Moreover, address any and all conditionals and comparative indicators accurately for valid results.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is:

(D) Donna

<answer>(D)</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
Question: How many animals are listed in the table?

The model got it wrong because it didn't account for the fact that one penguin named Bernard was removed from the table. Initially, there were 4 penguins. If we remove Bernard, only 3 remain. However, the model still chose the answer as 4. 

The prompt does state "In the event of data alterations or removals, adjust your understanding promptly and accurately". However, it seems like the model did not pay required heed to the removal event or didn't correctly adjust its understanding hence leading to the incorrect response.

Wrong Example 2:
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

The model got it wrong because it seems to have mistaken ‘last’ to mean ‘latest’ (in terms of addition) rather than considering 'last' in the context of alphabetic order. The prompt guides the language model to "grasp the true and precise meaning of each question" and to pay attention to all conditionals and comparative indicators. However, the model appears to disregard the instruction to sort the giraffes by alphabetic order, and as a result, it chose the 'latest' giraffe option.

4. Improve instructions for analyzing changes in the data set: Instructions on adapting and analyzing any changes or alterations in the data set could be made more clear and explicit. 

5. Reinforce relational terms understanding: Improve the model's comprehension of understanding relation terms like ‘last’, ‘first’, 'added', 'removed'. Clarifying the context of these words should be enforced.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and respond to inquiries that require discernment of cause and effect relationships. Take into account both internal (personal characteristics or choices) and external (environmental or situational) factors while making attributions. This could involve rationalizing human motivations, interpreting the consequences of natural events, or evaluating any specific phenomena from everyday life that necessitate a thorough understanding of causal dynamics.
(2) Examine the provided data and discerningly answer the questions, focusing on precise comprehension of the queries. Ensure understanding of the specific semantics of the question and respond exactly as asked. When multiple data sets are given, consider each independently. Let your response be guided by clear reasoning and factual accuracy rather than intuitive assumptions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. 

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

1. Misinterpretation of Data Revision: The model seems to ignore the part of the prompt stating that the program should adapt understanding as per data revisions or removals. Even after Bernard was removed from the data set, the model included him in its response. This may have contributed to the resulting incorrect answer.

2. Misinterpretation of Comparatives: It is also plausible that the model did not correctly understand or apply the comparatives. The model was asked to find penguins, "more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg." Only Gwen fulfils these two conditions. The model, however, counted Louis and Vincent as they were either over 5 years old or weighed more than 12 kg, not meeting both required conditions. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Explicit Instruction on Data Revision: The way the current prompt is phrased, it might not be clear that 'adapting understanding immediately' after data revisions means disregarding the removed data. The prompt could explicitly state that once data is removed, the model should not consider it in further analysis.

2. Clarification on Applying Comparatives: The prompt's request to pay attention to and strictly interpret comparatives may not be clear enough, and can be made more explicit. It would be beneficial to mention in detail how to deal with comparative conditions, clarifying that all conditions must be met before including a dataset in the count.

3. Clear Instructions on Complex Conditions: The prompt does not explicitly explain how to deal with multiple conditions working together. To prevent any ambiguity, the prompt can include instructions to handle situations where multiple criteria need to be met at the same time.

4. Emphasize Accuracy over Quantity: The model should be reminded to focus on the accuracy of the data rather than the quantity; not all data pieces may be relevant to the question. Even if there are three penguins older than five years, the weight requirement must also be met for them to be counted in the answer. 

5. Reinstate Non-inference Instruction: The instructions about not inferring beyond the literal meaning of terms could be reiterated, emphasizing no assumptions should be made about the categories or concepts not explicitly presented in the data. 

6. Highlight Relational & Comparative Terms: These are crucial for understanding the nuances of comparison (e.g., 'more than' vs. 'at least'). Restructuring the prompt to bring these terms to the forefront might facilitate a better grasp of their significance.

Analyze the provided data meticulously and answer the questions with precision and objectivity, ensuring a complete and accurate understanding of each question and its terms. Pay acute attention to relational terms such as 'more than,' 'less than,' 'at least,' 'no more than', and other comparative indicators, interpreting them strictly as expressed in the problem statement. In case of data revisions or removals, adapt your understanding immediately and accurately. Treat each data set individually when multiple sets are provided. Your answers should be guided by sound reasoning and the factual data at hand, refraining from assumptions or conjectures. Additionally, consider each term in its appropriate context without assuming categories or concepts not explicitly presented in the data. Carefully interpret the explicit information from the provided data without inferring beyond its literal meaning. Your response should exhibit a clear understanding of the direct questions and also an ability to apply accurate logic based on explicit information present in the data set.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old: Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old).

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(D) 4</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.

Which is the oldest giraffe?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine the oldest giraffe, we need to look at the age of each giraffe listed in the table. 

The ages of the giraffes are as follows:
- Jody: 5 years old
- Gladys: 10 years old
- Marian: 2 years old
- Donna: 9 years old

Therefore, the oldest giraffe is Gladys, who is 10 years old.

Therefore, the answer is: <(B) Gladys>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Problem: The model misunderstood the comparative term "more than". Bernard, who is exactly five years old, has been incorrectly included as one being more than 5 years old.

Reason: The prompt asks the model to pay acute attention to relational terms such as 'more than', but it doesn't clarify how strict it should be while interpreting these terms. Bernard, being exactly 5 years old, was not 'more than' 5.

Improvement: The prompt should specify that the model must differentiate between the terms 'more than' and 'at least' and be strict in their application.

Wrong Example 2: 

Problem: The model again misunderstood the comparative term 'more than'. Here, the model considers giraffes that are 5 years old as 'more than' 5.

Reason: This is the same issue as in the first example. The model didn't properly understand the specificity of the comparative term 'more than' and wrongly included the giraffe that is exactly 5 years old.

Improvement: Same as example 1, the prompt should specify to take 'more than' strictly and not equal to the value.

Wrong Example 3: 

Problem: The options have a typographical error, having "Louise" instead of "Louis". But, since the question asked for the oldest "giraffe", there shouldn't even be a penguin in the options. The model should've identified this inconsistency.

Reason: While the prompt asks the model to treat each dataset individually for multiple sets, it doesn't cover instructions on how to handle inconsistent or wrong choices in multiple-options.

Improvement: The prompt can be detailed to pay extra attention to the options provided and cross-verify them with the provided data/question.

General Improvements based on the reasons:

1. Clearly define the strict application of comparative terms like 'more than' and 'less than'. Discourage consideration of scenarios where the values are equal to the boundary case.

2. Stress on the importance of handling inconsistencies in question choices or options, especially for questions where multiple sets are provided.

3. Set a guideline to verify the question choices with context and logical reasoning. If an option seems illogical or irrelevant, it needs to be treated with a healthy degree of scepticism.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11

How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?

gradient:
Analysis:

Example 1:

The question asks for the count of penguins that are "less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg". The model incorrectly answers with option B (2): "Louis and Vincent."

On analyzing, we found that:
1. Louis is indeed 7 years old and weighs 11kg, so he fulfills both criteria.
2. However, Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11kg. While he fulfills the weight criteria, he does not fulfill the age criteria as he is not less than 8 years old.

Problems with the prompt:
1. The prompt, although detailed in its directive of adhering to guidelines precisely, failed to ensure that the model accurately assess the applicability of all conditions in the question. The model seemingly glossed over the "less than 8 years old" condition while considering Vincent.
2. The prompt tells the model to pay acute attention to comparative indicators, but in this case, the model didn't effectively consider the 'less than' employed in the question.

Possible improvements to the prompt:
1. The prompt should emphasize the importance of meeting all conditions to be considered applicable, not just one or some among many.
2. It can further stress on deploying thoroughness when comparing each data with the respective conditions. Each criteria must be understood in complete isolation and later consider their cumulative applicability.
3. Add points specifically surrounding numerics, as the model might interpret words differently than the numeric data. As in this case, 'less than 8' should strictly exclude 8.
4. It might be beneficial to prompt the model to cross-verify its answer with each condition stipulated in the question to mitigate overlooking any criteria.
5. Explicitly encourage the model to understand that the fulfiller of the condition must satisfy all the criteria entirely.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are two penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg: Louis and Vincent. 

Therefore, the answer is <B>2</B>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Analysis:

Example 1:

The question asks for the count of penguins that are "less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg". The model incorrectly answers with option B (2): "Louis and Vincent."

On analyzing, we found that:
1. Louis is indeed 7 years old and weighs 11kg, so he fulfills both criteria.
2. However, Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11kg. While he fulfills the weight criteria, he does not fulfill the age criteria as he is not less than 8 years old.

Problems with the prompt:
1. The prompt, although detailed in its directive of adhering to guidelines precisely, failed to ensure that the model accurately assess the applicability of all conditions in the question. The model seemingly glossed over the "less than 8 years old" condition while considering Vincent.
2. The prompt tells the model to pay acute attention to comparative indicators, but in this case, the model didn't effectively consider the 'less than' employed in the question.

Possible improvements to the prompt:
1. The prompt should emphasize the importance of meeting all conditions to be considered applicable, not just one or some among many.
2. It can further stress on deploying thoroughness when comparing each data with the respective conditions. Each criteria must be understood in complete isolation and later consider their cumulative applicability.
3. Add points specifically surrounding numerics, as the model might interpret words differently than the numeric data. As in this case, 'less than 8' should strictly exclude 8.
4. It might be beneficial to prompt the model to cross-verify its answer with each condition stipulated in the question to mitigate overlooking any criteria.
5. Explicitly encourage the model to understand that the fulfiller of the condition must satisfy all the criteria entirely.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
Step 1 - The question asks for the number of penguins who are less than 8 years old.
Step 2 - The model provides the correct data alteration information, acknowledging the addition of James and deletion of Bernard from the table.
Step 3 - Unfortunately, the model incorrectly identifies Vincent (9 years old) as being less than 8 years old, hence selecting answer B (2 penguins) instead of the correct A (1 penguin).

Reason: The model fails to perform a correct numerical comparison necessary for a correct answer. It stated that Vincent's age (9) is less than 8, which is factually incorrect.

Wrong Example 2:
Step 1 - The question asks for the count of penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.
Step 2 - The model identifies the alteration in data accurately - the addition of James and removal of Bernard.
Step 3 - Regrettably, the model generated a wrong answer, C (3 penguins), while the correct answer is A (1 penguin).

Reason: The model didn't classify the data correctly based on provided conditions, resulting in an inaccurate quantity count.

From these errors, we can gather that the current prompt shortcomings are as follows:
1. Inaccurate Numerical Comparison: The model fails to accurately compare numerical values, leading to incorrect inclusion or exclusion of data points.
2. Incorrect Classification: The model doesn't correctly classify datapoints based on the provided conditions, resulting in wrong quantity count.
3. Misinterpretation of Comparative Indicators: The model misunderstands the relational terms in the given statement (less than, more than).

Based on these key areas of improvement, the more effective prompt can be:

Carefully analyze the provided data set, paying particular attention to any changes including additions, deletions, or modifications. Effectively interpret numerical attributes and ensure a correct understanding of relational terms such as less than, greater than etc. Make certain that your analyses respects the conditions laid out in the tasks and your answers rely on precise numerical comparison and classification according to given parameters. Double check that your answer corresponds to the correct count of relevant elements in the data in accordance with the questions. Your response must be free from assumptions and solely based on provided data. Don't forget to encapsulate your answer within the designated answer tags.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to count the number of penguins and giraffes that are older than 5 years.

In the penguin table:
- Louis is 7 years old
- Bernard is 5 years old (not older than 5)
- Vincent is 9 years old
- Gwen is 8 years old
- James is 12 years old

In the giraffe table:
- Jody is 5 years old
- Gladys is 10 years old
- Marian is 2 years old (not older than 5)
- Donna is 9 years old

Counting the animals older than 5 years, we have Louis, Vincent, Gwen, James, Jody, Gladys, and Donna. This gives us a total of 7 animals that are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) 7</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The question asks about animals that are "more than 5 years old", which means the model should count those animals whose age is 6 or more, rather than including those who are exactly 5. Thus, Bernard the penguin and Jody the giraffe should be excluded from the count. However, the model includes these two animals in its calculation, yielding an incorrect final count (7 instead of the correct answer, 6). This error occurs because the language model does not interpret the phrase "more than 5 years old" correctly.

Wrong Example 2:
The question asks for the "name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order". Although the model correctly identifies Donna as one of the giraffe names, it fails to remember the directive to sort them alphabetically before finding the last name. The last giraffe alphabetically should have been Marian, not Donna. Here, the language model has failed to follow the sorting directive and this resulted in the wrong answer.

Wrong Example 3:
The question asks "How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?". However, the model seems to ignore the second condition about weight, since the instant inclusion of all penguins over the age of 5 leads to an incorrect answer. The model counts Louis, Vincent, Gwen, and James, who are all over 5 years old without checking their weights. However, Louis and Vincent each weigh only 11 kg, which is less than the required 12 kg. Thus, the model answered with 3, but the correct answer was 1 (only Gwen fulfills both conditions). The language model failed to correctly consider the logical “and” in the question, which required it to consider both conditions simultaneously.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Precise Numerical Understanding: The language model should be improved to more correctly understand numerical attributes as per the prompt instruction regarding strict "factual accuracy and sound reasoning." Its ability to accurately interpret the terms "more than," "less than," and exact numbers needs to be reinforced.
2. Follow Steps and Directives: The language model should pay closer attention to the specific directives within the question. This involves accurately carrying out steps such as sorting before proceeding to the final question interpretation.
3. Complex Conditional Handling: The prompt should be better designed to direct the language model to handle complex conditionals correctly. When multiple conditions are provided (e.g., age and weight), the model should be made to understand that it needs to apply all conditions simultaneously to yield the correct answer.
4. Factual Representation: The model should be prompted to maintain strictness in following the factual information presented, especially in tasks like comparing, sorting, and counting. Real‐world common-sense reasoning should be applied appropriately.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at both the penguins and giraffes data sets.

In the penguins data set, we have Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). Out of these, Louis, Vincent, and Gwen are more than 5 years old. So, in the penguins data set, there are 3 animals more than 5 years old.

In the giraffes data set, we have Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), Marian (2 years old), and Donna (9 years old). Out of these, Gladys, Donna, and Jody are more than 5 years old. So, in the giraffes data set, there are 3 animals more than 5 years old.

Combining both data sets, we have a total of 3 penguins and 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old. Therefore, the total number of animals more than 5 years old is 6.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(B) 6</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The model incorrectly answered the question with the option (B) 6 when the correct answer was (A) 5. In detail, the model correctly analyzed the data for penguins and found three penguins older than 5 years. When analyzing the data for giraffes, the model incorrectly included Jody who is 5 years old, not older than 5 years, and therefore counted one extra animal which led to the wrong answer. The error lies not with misunderstanding the prompt but in the details of the model's data interpretation. Here's a breakdown of the prompt's influence on the incorrect answer:

1. Assumption of Age Greater Than Whether to Include Exact Age: The model might have misunderstood the age criteria set in the question as "5 years old or more" instead of "more than 5 years old". This could be due to ambiguity in the language model's training data about how to handle these boundary cases.

2. Numerical Attribute Misunderstanding: The model did not fully understand the numerical constraints of the problem, specifically regarding the conditional 'more than'. It interpreted '5 years old' to satisfy the conditional 'more than 5 years old' incorrectly. 

3. Factual Inaccuracy: The model's assessment that Jody, the giraffe, being "5 years old" as akin to "more than 5 years old" is inaccurate.

However, the prompt did correctly ask the model to perform a detail-oriented analysis, and the model correctly considered each data set individually before offering a combined answer. It appropriately followed the guideline to consider factual accuracy, but unfortunately made a mistake in its interpretation.

To improve the prompt, we could consider emphasizing the need for precise interpretation of the conditions and specifying even clearer definitions for conditions such as 'more than'. However, it seems the primary issue lies more in the model's natural language understanding capabilities than in the prompt design itself. It might be more beneficial to provide more specific training for the model on numerical constraints and comparative terms understanding, rather than altering the prompt significantly. 

Prompt improvement aspects:

1. A more explicit emphasis on the precision and strictness of conditions.
2. Clear definitions of terms like 'more than'.
3. Examples of correctly analyzing these conditions could also be included in the prompt.  
4. Provide more numerical constraint examples in training dataset.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at both the penguins and giraffes data sets.

In the penguins data set, we have Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). Out of these, Louis, Vincent, and Gwen are more than 5 years old. So, in the penguins data set, there are 3 animals more than 5 years old.

In the giraffes data set, we have Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), Marian (2 years old), and Donna (9 years old). Out of these, Gladys, Donna, and Jody are more than 5 years old. So, in the giraffes data set, there are 3 animals more than 5 years old.

Combining both data sets, we have a total of 3 penguins and 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old. Therefore, the total number of animals more than 5 years old is 6.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The analysis of the example reveals the following areas of misunderstanding that led to the wrong prediction by the model:

1. Misinterpretation of Age Condition: The model incorrectly interpreted the age criteria given in the question. Jody's age was counted as more than 5 even though Jody is exactly 5 years old and shouldn't be included in the count of entities more than 5 years old. Therefore, the model does not fully grasp the definition of the "greater than" operator. 

2. Incorrect Counting: The model executed the counting incorrectly, which resulted in a wrong prediction. It counted instances where the giraffe's age was equal to as well as greater than 5. 

3. Assuming Equal to as Greater Than: The model bundled the states of 'equal to' and 'greater than' together, which led to the mistake of including an entity equal to the defined condition. 

To improve the prompt and prevent future occurrences of similar mistakes, the following measures need to be implemented:

1. Clearer Instruction on Logical Operators: The prompt should direct the model to understand and differentiate between various logical operators fully. It needs to have a clear understanding of the difference between 'equal to', 'greater than', 'less than', etc. 

2. Provide more explicit conditions: The prompt should further clarify that the conditions need to be met strictly and any condition mentioned should not be assumed as inclusive of the parameters.

3. Ensure adequate guidance on counting: An explicit directive can be given in the prompt to ensure accuracy in performing the counting function. For example, an instruction like "Count entities only when they fulfil the strictly interpreted condition, excluding borderline cases." 

4. Stress on meticulous interpretation: The prompt should stress the significance of interpreting the queries and data meticulously and accurately to ensure more precise answers. 

5. Emphasis on cross-checking: The model should be reminded in the prompt to cross-verify its responses against the data to confirm their accuracy, especially after performing tasks like counting or determining greater or lesser values.

Apply sound logical reasoning and stay factually accurate while performing operations like counting or summation, taking care that your answer reflects the most recent data updates. Before finalizing the response, ensure that your interpretation is comprehensive, so no data or condition is overlooked. Critically examine the conditions stated in the question, strictly distinguishing between 'equal to', 'greater than', 'less than' etc., ensuring that counting or comparison strictly adhere to these specified conditions. Be mindful to exclude borderline cases when conditions specify 'more than' or 'less than' as these do not include 'equal to'. After completing your analysis, corroborate your responses with the data once more to verify precision.
cur_prompt: Meticulously review the provided data and answer the questions precisely, focusing on individual conditions in the queries. Ensure understanding of the logical operators like 'and' or 'or' within the question, and respond in strict adherence to those conditions. When multiple data sets are given, evaluate each independently but take into account all updates, changes, or additions made to these sets. Cross-check your responses with the data to ensure their accuracy, avoiding assumptions. Let your answers manifest factually correct and logical reasoning while handling tasks like count or summation, ensuring that they are in line with the most recent data. Before finalizing the response, confirm the comprehensiveness of your interpretation of the query as well as the data, ensuring no element is overlooked or discarded.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are two penguins more than 8 years old after deleting Bernard:
- Louis is 7 years old
- Vincent is 9 years old

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) 2</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Misinterpretation of Data: In the original prompt, the model was asked to meticulously review the data. However, in the given example, the model made an error in understanding the data after Bernard was removed. It's counting Louis, who is 7 years old, as being more than 8 years old. This indicates that the prompt could have been clearer in instructing the model to scrutinize the information in a data set deeper.

2. Inability to Understand Updates to Data Sets: The prompt instructs the AI to evaluate each data set and pay attention to updates, and in this case, the deletion of Bernard from the data set. Despite this instruction, the AI failed to correctly interpret the updated data set. This implies that the prompt can be made more explicit in directing the AI to account for deletions or alterations to data sets.

3. Incorrect Reasoning: The model was required to handle tasks like count, which implies that it should count the number of penguins that are more than 8 years old. Despite the guidance, the model made an error in this counting task, suggesting that the model misunderstood the conditions of the task due to a lack of explicitness or a misunderstanding of the word "more."

Aspects for Improvement:

1. More explicit directions: The prompt can include more explicit instructions about scrutinizing the data, i.e., the model can be directed to verify every piece of data and its relevance to the question task at hand.

2. Highlight changes/updates to the data: Making sure the model re-evaluates data after updates. Specify that changes, additions, or deletions might affect answers and must be accounted for.

3. Define Logical Operators: In order to avoid the misunderstanding of words like "more," the prompt could provide definitions for logical operators clearly.
   
4. Encourage careful comparison of data to task conditions: The model should be encouraged to cross-verify that the data it has processed meets the conditions of the task or question before deriving a conclusion. This might help avoid inaccurate counts or summaries. 

5. Encourage double-checking of the AI's understanding: The model could be prompted to double-check its understanding of the question and the conditions in it, ensuring its interpretation is aligned with the actual requirement.

Wrong Example Explanation:

The prompt failed to make the model consider the clause "more than 5 years old." It somehow considered as ‘5 years old and above’, which led to the inclusion of Jody, who is precisely 5 years old. In this instance, only Gladys and Donna (who are 10 and 9 years old respectively) should have been counted, as they are the only ones over 5 years old. 

Reasons why the prompt led to wrong answer:
1. Misinterpretation of the query condition - The model did not correctly interpret the age condition mentioned in the question. Instead of focusing on giraffes that are strictly more than 5 years old, it considered giraffes that are 5 years old and above.
2. Numerical interpretation of data - The model might have considered the number '5' as a lower inclusive bound, leading to the miscount. This indicates that the model needs to handle numerical conditions more accurately.
3. Logical operator misinterpretation - The model failed to properly handle the 'more than' operator. This clearly shows that the model needs to understand and apply logical operators more efficiently.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Include specific instructions about numerical conditions - Make explicit that 'more than X' does not include 'X' itself and that 'less than X' does not include 'X' itself.
2. Improve the precision of logical operators - Add guidelines about the precise interpretation and application of logical operators, specifically in the context of conditions within queries.
3. Encourage more careful review of conditions and data - Strengthen instructions for meticulous review of provided data and conditions in queries. The model should be urged to double-check all conditions and how they are applied to each individual data point.

When multiple data sets are presented, handle each with individual attention but also account for all updates, changes, or additions made to these sets. Make sure your responses are a direct result of your understanding of the data rather than resting on assumptions. Employ logical reasoning accurately while answering tasks related to count, sum, or other numerical operations, guaranteeing your answers reflect the most recent data. Before handing in your answers, verify that your interpretation of the query and data is comprehensive, and assure that no element is neglected or dismissed, considering each individual data point in respect to the applicable conditions.

1st Wrong Example:
Question: "We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table. How many penguins are less than 8 years old?"

Model's incorrect response: "There are three penguins less than 8 years old: Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). Therefore, the answer is <C>3</C>."

Model's error analysis: The model failed to consider that the penguin named Bernard was deleted from the data set. It also included Gwen in its counting although her age is exactly 8, not less than 8. Thus, it incorrectly answered with 3 penguins instead of correctly recognizing that only 1 penguin (Louis) was less than 8 years old after Bernard's deletion.

Reasons for error:
a. Data Modification: The model didn't accurately account for updates or changes made in the data set. The deletion of Bernard from the table was overlooked.
b. Incorrect Condition Interpretation: The model failed to properly apply the 'less than' condition. It included Gwen, whose age is equal to 8, disobeying the 'less than 8' condition.
c. Logical Reasoning: There was a lack of effective logical reasoning from the model in interpreting the conditions and applying them correctly to the data.

Improvement for the prompt:
a. Emphasize on the Importance of Data Changes: The prompt should underline the importance of considering data changes, deletions, or additions to ensure current data is dealt with.
b. Clarify Meaning of Conditions: The prompt needs to stress the distinction between 'equal to', 'greater than', 'less than', and similar conditions to ensure correct application during counting or comparison.
c. Strengthen Logical Reasoning: The prompt should encourage the model to apply stronger logical reasoning in understanding and applying the conditions.

On a broader note, make sure that instructions in the prompt are more explicit in terms of taking updates to the dataset into account and correctly interpreting conditions such as 'less than', 'greater than', and 'equal to'. The instructions should also push the model to carefully double-check every step of its reasoning to minimize errors.

Review:

<1> 
In this scenario, the model identified 3 penguins instead of 1 who are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg. This mistake is made because it did not consider the updated dataset. The model failed to pay heed to the aspect of the prompt that urges focusing on any changes, updates, or additions made to the datasets; in this case, Bernard's removal from the table. 

<2> 
In this second scenario, the model correctly deduced from the updated data that there are now 5 penguins. However, it incorrectly identified the response as 'A', denoting one penguin instead of 'E' that signifies five. This discrepancy may arise from a misunderstanding or misreading of the options presented or a confusion between the data and their corresponding labeling options. 

Improvements:
1. Make the instruction to consider updates, changes, or additions to the dataset more explicit, so the model requires to reflect these modifications accurately in the responses.
2. Highlight the need to match the correct response with the appropriate option label.
3. Encourage more rigorous and detailed analysis while considering 'and' and 'or' conditions in the questions.
4. Better emphasize the exclusion of borderline cases in 'more than' or 'less than' situations and ensure strict adherence.
5. The prompt can further stress on double-checking the data and comprehension of the query before producing the final response.
6. Instruction to correctly relate the numerical answer to their corresponding labelling option ('A' to 1, 'E' to 5 etc.) can be added.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg:
- Louis: 7 years old, weight 11 kg (does not meet the weight condition)
- Bernard: 5 years old, weight 13 kg (meets both conditions)
- Vincent: 9 years old, weight 11 kg (does not meet the weight condition)
- Gwen: 8 years old, weight 15 kg (meets both conditions)

Therefore, the answer is <(C) 3>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are now 5 penguins in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <(E) 5>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Review:

<1> 
In this scenario, the model identified 3 penguins instead of 1 who are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg. This mistake is made because it did not consider the updated dataset. The model failed to pay heed to the aspect of the prompt that urges focusing on any changes, updates, or additions made to the datasets; in this case, Bernard's removal from the table. 

<2> 
In this second scenario, the model correctly deduced from the updated data that there are now 5 penguins. However, it incorrectly identified the response as 'A', denoting one penguin instead of 'E' that signifies five. This discrepancy may arise from a misunderstanding or misreading of the options presented or a confusion between the data and their corresponding labeling options. 

Improvements:
1. Make the instruction to consider updates, changes, or additions to the dataset more explicit, so the model requires to reflect these modifications accurately in the responses.
2. Highlight the need to match the correct response with the appropriate option label.
3. Encourage more rigorous and detailed analysis while considering 'and' and 'or' conditions in the questions.
4. Better emphasize the exclusion of borderline cases in 'more than' or 'less than' situations and ensure strict adherence.
5. The prompt can further stress on double-checking the data and comprehension of the query before producing the final response.
6. Instruction to correctly relate the numerical answer to their corresponding labelling option ('A' to 1, 'E' to 5 etc.) can be added.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution

There are two penguins who are more than 8 years old: Vincent (9 years old) and Gwen (8 years old).

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) 2</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Interpretation of 'More Than':
The issue can be noticed in the model's interpretation of 'more than' as including 'equal to'. In the prompt, the instruction does clearly mention "Be mindful to exclude borderline cases when conditions specify 'more than' or 'less than' as these do not include 'equal to'". However, the model still counts Gwen who is 8 years old as 'more than 8'. This incorrect interpretation may be due to the complex structuring and language of the prompt, making the model miss this crucial detail.

2) Overlooking specific instructions:
The prompt explicitly asks the model to critically examine the conditions and distinguish between 'equal to', 'greater than', 'less than'. Nevertheless, the model seems to overlook this instruction, which leads to the wrong answer. The model's comprehension needs to be improved to strictly follow such specified conditions.

3) Verification: 
The model should have re-checked the calculated result against the conditions stated in the question. As directed by the prompt, it should “corroborate your responses with the data once more to verify precision", which could have allowed it to detect the discrepancy.

Improvements:
1) Simplify: The prompt is very complex, and it would be better to simplify and unscramble the instructions clearly. Making directions concise and explicit can help the model better understand and process them.
2) Reinforce the importance of the ‘more than’, ‘less than’, ‘equal to’ differentials. Emphasizing these conditions could help reinforce their importance to the model.
3) Encourage model to review its answer before finalizing, given the specific problem constraints.
4) Additionally, the model should be prompted to double-check its calculations, especially when dealing with conditions or qualifiers.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Wrong Answer: The model's response is: (D) Donna, whereas the correct answer should be (C) Marian.

Explanation:

- The prompt is heavily focused on numerical data and logical operators like 'more than', 'less than'. However, the question in this example requires sorting by alphabetical order, which may not be sufficiently covered by the current prompt.
- Confusion can arise because the model was seemingly instructed more towards interpretation of numerical data and conditions, than toward a broader understanding of various types of sorting or ordering data.
- In the prompt, there's no detailed explanation or examples of 'less than' or 'more than' in the context of alphabetical ordering.

Example 2:

Question: How many penguins are more than 8 years old?

Wrong Answer: The model's response is: (B) 2, whereas the correct answer should be (A) 1.

Explanation:

- The prompt explains that 'more than X' should exclude X itself. However, the model incorrectly includes 'X' (8 years) when determining the number of penguins that are 'more than' 8 years old.
- The model may have misunderstood the phrase 'more than' in the context of age, which is a discrete and incremental value, unlike a continuous range of numerical data.
- The deletion of the penguin Bernard may have not been acknowledged properly. It's necessary to emphasize that any updates, removals or additions to data sets should be carefully watched and integrated.

Proposed Improvements:

- Clarify the use of 'more than' or 'less than' in the context of both numerical and non-numerical data. For example, when sorting alphabetically or dealing with discrete numbers, these terms might be understood differently.
- Included special cases in the instructions, such as operating on updates (additions, deletions) in real-time data.
- The prompt could be refined to ensure that the model understands that queries may involve complex operations (e.g., sorting data alphabetically, counting unique items based on a condition), not just numerical comparisons.
- There should be a clear understanding of Logical operators application on different types of data such as continuous numerical data, discrete numerical data, categorical data, and text or string data. 
- The model should also ensure that deletions, additions or any kind of changes to the data sets are incorporated before solving the query.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the question asks how many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. The model's response considers Bernard (who is exactly 5 years old) in its count, which led to the wrong prediction. The issue lies in the misinterpretation of the query's condition, specifically for the term 'more than'. 

<2>
In the second example, the model again misinterprets 'less than' while reviewing the table, including Louis, who is exactly 7 years old, hence giving an incorrect response. So, again the model fails to exclude 'X' when asked for "less than X".

<3>
The third example shows the model failing to update its understanding of data or forgetting to account for recently added data. Despite an explicit instruction in the prompt to consider “the most recent data” (including new additions), the model failed to do this in this case. The new addition, 'James', was not considered while counting the penguins more than 5 years old.

Areas that could improve the prompt:

1. Explicit Emphasis: More explicit emphasis should be placed on the correct interpretation of 'more than X' and 'less than X' to ensure exclusion of 'X'. The prompt's current wording might be too verbose and the key information could get lost.

2. Language Simplification: Simplify the language and structure of the prompt so the model focuses more on the task's key points, such as understanding and correctly applying logical operators, keeping track of updates in the data and maintaining a focus on the most recent data.

3. Iterative Reminders: There should be iterative reminders within the prompt for the model to continually update its data analysis with any new additions, updates or revisions.

4. Reinforce Comprehension: Reinforce the importance of complete comprehension of the query and its conditions before processing the data and arriving at an answer.

5. Regular Checks: Ensure the model is directed to regularly check its understanding and application of the conditions and logical operators. This might help to avoid incorrect interpretations from carrying over across tasks. 

6. Summarize Instruction: Provide a summary of major instructions at the end so that the model has a quick go-to guide of major points it needs to remember. This might help the model keep the most prime actions on top of mind while processing the prompts. 

By focusing on these areas, the model's understanding and interpretation of the task may improve, leading to more accurate responses.

Therefore, the answer is <D> (4) </D>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the first example, the question asks how many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. The model's response considers Bernard (who is exactly 5 years old) in its count, which led to the wrong prediction. The issue lies in the misinterpretation of the query's condition, specifically for the term 'more than'. 

<2>
In the second example, the model again misinterprets 'less than' while reviewing the table, including Louis, who is exactly 7 years old, hence giving an incorrect response. So, again the model fails to exclude 'X' when asked for "less than X".

<3>
The third example shows the model failing to update its understanding of data or forgetting to account for recently added data. Despite an explicit instruction in the prompt to consider “the most recent data” (including new additions), the model failed to do this in this case. The new addition, 'James', was not considered while counting the penguins more than 5 years old.

Areas that could improve the prompt:

1. Explicit Emphasis: More explicit emphasis should be placed on the correct interpretation of 'more than X' and 'less than X' to ensure exclusion of 'X'. The prompt's current wording might be too verbose and the key information could get lost.

2. Language Simplification: Simplify the language and structure of the prompt so the model focuses more on the task's key points, such as understanding and correctly applying logical operators, keeping track of updates in the data and maintaining a focus on the most recent data.

3. Iterative Reminders: There should be iterative reminders within the prompt for the model to continually update its data analysis with any new additions, updates or revisions.

4. Reinforce Comprehension: Reinforce the importance of complete comprehension of the query and its conditions before processing the data and arriving at an answer.

5. Regular Checks: Ensure the model is directed to regularly check its understanding and application of the conditions and logical operators. This might help to avoid incorrect interpretations from carrying over across tasks. 

6. Summarize Instruction: Provide a summary of major instructions at the end so that the model has a quick go-to guide of major points it needs to remember. This might help the model keep the most prime actions on top of mind while processing the prompts. 

By focusing on these areas, the model's understanding and interpretation of the task may improve, leading to more accurate responses.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Wrong answer: (C) 3
Correct answer: (B) 2

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The task was to determine how many giraffes are more than 5 years old but not inclusive of the age of 5.
2. From the data, only Gladys and Donna fit this category as their ages are 10 and 9 respectively which is more than 5.
3. Instead, the model included Jody also who is exactly 5 years old which was not meant to be included as per the instruction in the prompt "interpret 'more than X' as strictly excluding 'X' itself".
4. Hence, the model produced the wrong answer (C) 3.

Why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
1. The model may not be correctly interpreting the instruction about the logical interpretation of 'more than X'. 
2. It includes the data point that is exactly meeting the condition (exactly 5 years in this case) while it should have been strictly more than.
3. There may be a misunderstanding of the term 'strictly' by the model.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. More emphatic clarification could be used about the handling of phrases like 'more than X' and 'less than X'. For instance, stress that 'more than X' should always exclude 'X' itself.
2. Add examples within the prompt that illustrate exactly how to handle such conditions. Such as, “if asked for instances 'more than 5', an entry of exactly 5 should not be counted.”
3. The model’s understanding of logical operators and their application needs to be refined so that it understands these conditions in a contextually accurate manner.
4. Make clarifications that logical operators must be applied strictly and accurately with no leniency or assumptions.
5. The model may benefit from additional training or instruction on understanding and applying numerical data constraints.

As you analyze the data, ensure a precise comprehension of logical operators like 'more than', 'less than', 'and', or 'or' within the query; these must be applied faithfully to the nature of numerical data. For example, interpret 'more than X' as strictly excluding 'X' itself, and the same for 'less than X'. When multiple data sets are presented, handle each with individual attention but also account for all updates, changes, or additions made to these sets. Make sure your responses are a direct result of your understanding of the data rather than resting on assumptions. Employ logical reasoning accurately while answering tasks related to count, sum, or other numerical operations, guaranteeing your answers reflect the most recent data.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is (C) 3.

<answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Wrong answer: (C) 3
Correct answer: (B) 2

Step-by-step explanation:
1. The task was to determine how many giraffes are more than 5 years old but not inclusive of the age of 5.
2. From the data, only Gladys and Donna fit this category as their ages are 10 and 9 respectively which is more than 5.
3. Instead, the model included Jody also who is exactly 5 years old which was not meant to be included as per the instruction in the prompt "interpret 'more than X' as strictly excluding 'X' itself".
4. Hence, the model produced the wrong answer (C) 3.

Why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
1. The model may not be correctly interpreting the instruction about the logical interpretation of 'more than X'. 
2. It includes the data point that is exactly meeting the condition (exactly 5 years in this case) while it should have been strictly more than.
3. There may be a misunderstanding of the term 'strictly' by the model.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. More emphatic clarification could be used about the handling of phrases like 'more than X' and 'less than X'. For instance, stress that 'more than X' should always exclude 'X' itself.
2. Add examples within the prompt that illustrate exactly how to handle such conditions. Such as, “if asked for instances 'more than 5', an entry of exactly 5 should not be counted.”
3. The model’s understanding of logical operators and their application needs to be refined so that it understands these conditions in a contextually accurate manner.
4. Make clarifications that logical operators must be applied strictly and accurately with no leniency or assumptions.
5. The model may benefit from additional training or instruction on understanding and applying numerical data constraints.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and respond to inquiries that require discernment of cause and effect relationships. Take into account both internal (personal characteristics or choices) and external (environmental or situational) factors while making attributions. This could involve rationalizing human motivations, interpreting the consequences of natural events, or evaluating any specific phenomena from everyday life that necessitate a thorough understanding of causal dynamics.
(2) Examine the provided data and discerningly answer the questions, focusing on precise comprehension of the queries. Ensure understanding of the specific semantics of the question and respond exactly as asked. When multiple data sets are given, consider each independently. Let your response be guided by clear reasoning and factual accuracy rather than intuitive assumptions.
(3) Meticulously review the provided data and answer the questions precisely, focusing on individual conditions in the queries. Ensure understanding of the logical operators like 'and' or 'or' within the question, and respond in strict adherence to those conditions. When multiple data sets are given, evaluate each independently but take into account all updates, changes, or additions made to these sets. Cross-check your responses with the data to ensure their accuracy, avoiding assumptions. Let your answers manifest factually correct and logical reasoning while handling tasks like count or summation, ensuring that they are in line with the most recent data. Before finalizing the response, confirm the comprehensiveness of your interpretation of the query as well as the data, ensuring no element is overlooked or discarded.

gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. In the example, the prompt guides the model to consider both qualitative and quantitative details. In this scenario, “age” is a quantitative detail. The question asks for the penguins who are more than 8 years old. The model correctly identifies the 8-year-old penguin, Gwen, but it misinterprets the age of Vincent, who is actually 9 years old, as being more than 8. Therefore, the correct answer should be (A) 1.

Reasons for incorrect answer:
i. Misinterpretation of Data: The model may have misread or misinterpreted the data, considering 9 to be more than 8.
ii. Lack of Attention to Detail: Despite the prompt asking the model to pay meticulous attention to details, the model failed to do so in this case.

2. The earlier prompt may put too much stress on the interpretation of both qualitative and quantitative data while missing specific directives like "greater than or equal" or "greater than."

3. The prompt seems to be overly complicated, going into details about human characteristics etc., which aren't helpful in straightforward data analysis tasks and might cause the AI to focus too much on deeper connections rather than simple data interpretation.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Provide clearer instructions: Make the prompt more clear on how to interpret data, include directives like "given 'x' is greater than 'n', treat 'x' as a valid data point". 
  
2. Simpler prompts for straightforward tasks: Instead of going into details about the understanding of human motivations etc., for straightforward data interpretation task, it is better to have a simpler prompt that tells the model to directly answer mathematical or fact-based questions based on the given data.

3. Include specification of equality: Specify in the prompt that the model should discern between greater than and equal to from just greater than. 

4. Error checking: Ask the model to check the data again if preliminary calculations give an answer not present in the provided options.

Revised prompt:
Analyse the given data and focus on numerical and categorical details. For mathematical or factual questions, compare and validate the data provided. If the question stipulates a condition like 'greater than', treat data points that fulfill this condition as valid. Ensure to double-check your calculations if your answer isn't a given option. Do not infer motivations or deeper connections in direct data interpretation tasks.

The language model correctly counted the number of animals in two tables that are more than 5 years old. However, it made an error by considering the giraffe named 'Jody' who is exactly 5 years old as being more than 5. This mistake is caused by a misunderstanding of the question condition.

<2>
Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Wrong answer: (D) 4
Correct answer: (C) 3

The language model commits the same error here by considering the penguin named 'Bernard' who is exactly 5 years old as being more than 5. While the model correctly interpreted the dataset and extracted the correct values, it failed to accurately apply the conditions specified in the question.

<3>
Question: How many species are listed in the table?
Wrong answer: (D) 4
Correct answer: (A) 1

The language model seems to have misinterpreted the question. Instead of identifying the number of species in the data (which is 1, penguins), the model seems to have misunderstood the question to refer to the number of individual animals present.

Improvements to the Prompt:
1. Clarify Definition: Be explicit in the prompt that the model needs to understand age conditions correctly ("more than 5 years old" doesn't include "5 years old").
2. Question Comprehension: Enhance the model's ability to comprehend the question fully. It should be able to distinguish between the number of animals and the number of species.
3. Interpretation Accuracy: The model should accurately interpret the given data and apply it according to the instructions or conditions given in the question.
4. Nuanced Understanding: The prompt should highlight and insist on a nuanced understanding of the conditions to prevent misinterpretation of "more than", "less than", "equal to" and other similar conditions.
5. Logical Reasoning: Improve the logical reasoning abilities of the model by specifying it in the prompt. This could help in understanding relationships within the dataset better.
6. Precise Analysis: Specify in the prompt that the model needs to concentrate on precise detail analysis, especially when dealing with conditions and restrictions specified in the question. 

Example of Revised Prompt:
"Your task requires a thorough and meticulous analysis of both qualitative and quantitative details in provided data. Respond to inquiries by understanding and applying logical reasoning to discern cause and effect relationships. Pay careful attention to all conditions in the question, particularly regarding understandings like "more than", "less than", or "equal to". Distinguish between different types of information, such as species versus individual animals. Assess and include both individual characteristics (age, motivation) and external factors (height, weight) for comprehensive responses."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully consider both qualitative and quantitative details in the given data. Use this information to accurately respond to inquiries that need discernment of cause and effect relationships. Ensure that you fully understand and follow all conditions specified in the question, taking into account both personal (age, characteristics) and external (height, weight) factors while making assessments. This can involve human situations such as motivations, or interpreting the effects of specific phenomena that require thorough understanding and meticulous attention to data.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Carefully consider both qualitative and quantitative details in the given data. Use this information to accurately respond to inquiries that need discernment of cause and effect relationships. Ensure that you fully understand and follow all conditions specified in the question, taking into account both personal (age, characteristics) and external (height, weight) factors while making assessments. This can involve human situations such as motivations, or interpreting the effects of specific phenomena that require thorough understanding and meticulous attention to data.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in both tables. 

In the penguin table, there are 4 penguins listed with ages of 7, 5, 9, and 8. Out of these, 3 penguins are more than 5 years old (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen).

In the giraffe table, there are 4 giraffes listed with ages of 5, 10, 2, and 9. Out of these, 3 giraffes are more than 5 years old (Jody, Gladys, and Donna).

Therefore, there are a total of 6 animals (3 penguins + 3 giraffes) that are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Therefore, the answer is <D> 4 </D>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The model's input is a question asking for the number of penguins listed in the table after one named Bernard is deleted. The model answers inaccurately because it counts the total number of penguins present before Bernard is deleted and does not process the action of deletion that significantly changes the data.

Reason 1: Failure to understand data manipulation: The current prompt emphasizes analysis of the initial data provided, but it doesn't accentuate the importance of comprehending any changes or manipulations to the data as the question progresses. In this case, the deletion of Bernard from the table is a pivotal aspect which the model doesn't process accurately because the prompt does not direct it to consider factors such as deletions, additions, or alterations in the data.

Reason 2: Misinterpretation of cause and effect: Another issue is the model's flawed discernment of the cause and effect relationship. The prompt asks the model to understand cause and effect relationships, but it fails to apply this understanding to the relationship between the action (deletion of Bernard) and the effect (change in the number of penguins).

Reason 3: Not considering all conditions in the question: Although the prompt advises the model to follow all conditions specified in the question, the model does not accurately apply this guideline. It doesn't take into account the condition of Bernard's removal from the total count.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize the importance of understanding and applying the changes, manipulations, or updates to the data throughout the problem, not just the initial data given.
2. Include guidance for the model to correctly interpret and apply cause and effect relationships, especially in regards to changes in data or events described in the question.
3. Reinforce the directive to consider all conditions in the question, adding that this could include changes to the data set within the question as well.
