Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.",
