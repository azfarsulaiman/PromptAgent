Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend is happy to sell it. Bill makes an offer, but his friend insists on him not paying so much. Finally, Bill buys the right-side Bartlett bookend from his friend and goes home. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No <(B)>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
Wrong Answer: No <(B)>
Correct Answer: Yes <(A)>

Analysis: 
1. The language model could fail to understand the concept of "causal attribution" since it is a broad and complex psychological concept that is based on the attribution of events to certain causes. In the given case, the model might not properly decode the input due to the complexity of the scenario.
2. It could be because the language model doesn't correctly interpret the sequence of events and their effect. Bill's action of buying the right-side bookend led to Sue and him possessing the pair, which makes him a cause.
3. The language model might misinterpret the phrase "Did Bill cause them to possess" and it could have focused more on Sue's action of buying the left bookend, neglecting Bill's contribution completely.
4. The problems can also stem from an inadequate comprehension of the structure and conditions that define a cause-effect relationship by the language model. It might not have the correct understanding of the semantics of 'cause' in the context of 'possession' used in the question.

Improvements:
1. The prompt could be refined to make sure the language model is guided towards considering all the actions of the characters in the scenario. Something like "Consider all actions that lead to the end result when answering questions about causal attribution".
2. It could be useful to add a note in the prompt about the importance of the chronological order in cause-effect relationships.
3. Prompt could include an instruction to consider both direct and indirect contribution while attributing cause.
4. Adding and highlighting the keyword 'cause and effect relations' could encourage the model to understand causal relationships more effectively. 
5. Provide examples involved in the prompt that can guide the model to understand the semantic meaning of causality in context.
6. Include a component of checking for multiple causes of a single event in the prompt.
7. Specifically instruct the model to analyze the relationship between events and effects, and not focus solely on the final event or action.
8. The prompt could be designed to encourage the model to reason based on the sequence and consequences of events, not just the nature of individual actions.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that when the bullet travels through the air it will definitely disturb the air molecules around it. But the sniper doesn't care at all about disturbing air molecules, he just wants to shoot his target. So, he pulls the trigger.

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the red wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

The model's prediction is: B.

<1>
In this question, the language model is supposed to infer the counterfactual dependence regarding the sniper and the air molecules. The prompt leads to a wrong answer because it doesn't specifically guide the language model to focus on the intentionality aspect of the scenario. Intentionality is a fundamental concept in causal attribution that distinguishes between actions performed on purpose or out of negligence and those that are the unavoidable consequences of said actions. Therefore, without guidance, the AI might simply attribute all resulting occurrences to the antecedent action. 

<2>
In this scenario, the language model is expected to make a judgment on the fulfillment of conditions for a specific outcome, which in this case is Louie winning a bet. The prompt doesn't provide explicit instructions for the language model to infer that meeting at least one of the conditions (making a layup or a 3-point shot) is enough for Louie to win the bet. The model doesn’t take into account that the event has already occurred with the first successful shot. The redundancy of the final successful shot doesn’t negate the initial win but the language model gets it wrong because it evaluates each condition instead of the aggregate of conditions. 

<3>
This question requires the language model to grasp the concept of joint sufficiency — both wires touching the battery are necessary for the short circuit. The prompt doesn't provide clear guidance to differentiate between assignments (black wire should touch) and joint conditions (both wires touching causing the short). The model wrongly interpreted the known assignment of the black wire as the sole reason for a short circuit, dismissing the red wire's contribution due to lack of specific focus on the principle of joint causality in the prompt.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Make focus on understanding and interpreting conditions for a specific outcome clearer.
2. Provide directional hints to evaluate the intentionality of actions/events.
3. Include requirements to consider the joint contribution of factors in causality.
4. Encourage the evaluation of fulfilled conditions versus aggregate conditions.
5. Advocate for the understanding of the implication of past events on future outcomes.

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: "I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule." Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: "I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did Alex cause the plant to dry out?

gradient:
Example 1:

Question: "Did Alex cause the plant to dry out?"
Correct Answer: A (Yes)
Model's Answer: B (No)

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The question is about causal attribution. It is asking if Alex has caused the plants to dry out.
2. The story informs us that Alex and Benni used different fertilizers on the plants.
3. Alex used the fertilizer A X200R, which he was specifically instructed to use by Tom.
4. Benni used the fertilizer B Y33R because Alex forgot to tell him to only use A X200R.
5. The plants that dried up are the ones which were fertilized with both A X200R and B Y33R.
6. Alex caused the plants to dry out because he failed to pass on the correct instructions to Benni about using only A X200R. This led to Benni also applying B Y33R to the plants, causing them to dry out.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:
1. The prompt might have been too vague to the model, causing it to overlook the real cause which is the failure of communication.
2. The language model might have difficulty discerning the indirect cause-effect relationship portrayed in the story.
3. The model might have interpreted the question to ask only if Alex's use of A X200R directly caused the plants to dry out, without considering the indirect impact of Benni using B Y33R because of Alex's lack of communication.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. The prompt can be more specific about asking whether a certain character's actions or lack of action (in this case, Alex's failure to communicate) can be the cause of certain event (in this case, the plants drying out).
2. Rather than posing the task as "Answer questions about causal attribution," it might be better guide the model to consider indirect or non-obvious causations by asking "Consider all direct and indirect factors, and answer questions about causal attribution."
3. The prompt could clarify that the model should consider communication failures, misunderstandings, or circumstantial factors when attributing causes.
4. The model should be guided to understand complex scenarios and discern indirect cause-effect relationships better by including information about "failure of actions to deliver correct outcomes".

Question: "Did Alex cause the plant to dry out?"
Correct Answer: A (Yes)
Model's Answer: B (No)

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The question is about causal attribution. It is asking if Alex has caused the plants to dry out.
2. The story informs us that Alex and Benni used different fertilizers on the plants.
3. Alex used the fertilizer A X200R, which he was specifically instructed to use by Tom.
4. Benni used the fertilizer B Y33R because Alex forgot to tell him to only use A X200R.
5. The plants that dried up are the ones which were fertilized with both A X200R and B Y33R.
6. Alex caused the plants to dry out because he failed to pass on the correct instructions to Benni about using only A X200R. This led to Benni also applying B Y33R to the plants, causing them to dry out.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:
1. The prompt might have been too vague to the model, causing it to overlook the real cause which is the failure of communication.
2. The language model might have difficulty discerning the indirect cause-effect relationship portrayed in the story.
3. The model might have interpreted the question to ask only if Alex's use of A X200R directly caused the plants to dry out, without considering the indirect impact of Benni using B Y33R because of Alex's lack of communication.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. The prompt can be more specific about asking whether a certain character's actions or lack of action (in this case, Alex's failure to communicate) can be the cause of certain event (in this case, the plants drying out).
2. Rather than posing the task as "Answer questions about causal attribution," it might be better guide the model to consider indirect or non-obvious causations by asking "Consider all direct and indirect factors, and answer questions about causal attribution."
3. The prompt could clarify that the model should consider communication failures, misunderstandings, or circumstantial factors when attributing causes.
4. The model should be guided to understand complex scenarios and discern indirect cause-effect relationships better by including information about "failure of actions to deliver correct outcomes".

Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 
In the first example, the model's prompt led to a wrong answer as the question was referring to the causality of Joe's action. In this case, Joe inherently did not cause the accident but was part of a chain of events that lead to the incident. This is a common issue in causal attribution as it's challenging to discern direct, indirect, and unrelated causes. The model's misunderstanding might stem from confusion between necessary conditions and sufficient conditions. According to the problem, Joe's involvement is a necessary condition for the accident to happen but not a sufficient cause, as the drunk driver was the direct cause of the accident. So, a failure to distinguish between direct and indirect causation leads to the wrong answer.

Example 2: 
The language model incorrectly adjudicated blame in this scenario— in its interpretation, both the bear and the hedgehog were responsible, despite the hedgehog breaking the rules by taking pencils. The AI does not seem to take into account the rule the hedgehog broke as a contributory factor, possibly because the prompt does not specify the importance of considering normative or rules related factors in determining causal attribution. This casuistry in decision-making interpretation can be addressed by making the prompt more explicit about considering rules and norms.

Example 3:
In this case, the model struggles to identify that the climatic control system had alternative causes (the early arrival of travel agency employees) other than the design studio employees' arrival. It is not clearly indicated in the prompt that the AI model should consider alternative or simultaneous causes of an event while making causal attributions.

Example 4: 
In the fourth example, the model again misinterprets simultaneous causes (both Billy and Suzy arriving) as an either/or situation. Here, the prompt does not guide the model to consider that more than one factor can equally contribute to triggering an event.

Broadly, the current model prompt does not effectively guide the AI in:

1. Differentiating between direct and indirect causes.
2. Recognizing the importance of considering normative or rules related factors in establishing cause.
3. Evaluating alternative or simultaneous causes of an event.
4. Recognizing that multiple factors can contribute equally to an event.

To improve the prompt, it could be specified like:

"Consider all direct and indirect factors, including any failures in communication or actions, misunderstandings, or circumstantial influences. Remember to examine causality from different perspectives: look at the importance of rules and norms, evaluate the role of simultaneous causes, distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions, and recognize that multiple factors can collectively be responsible for an occurrence. Answer questions about causal attribution based on these extensive considerations."

Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Drew, Kylie, and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, as usual, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, and Oliver also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day.

gradient:
For example <1>:

The question is a causal attribution problem. The confusion arises primarily from the non-linear nature of the causation in question. While Drew's action of buying coffee on Tuesday did contribute to the shop's profit, it wasn't solely responsible for it. The prompt was not able to adequately convey this to the language model. 

The model's wrong answer shows that it didn't interpret the nature of causation accurately. In this scenario, the fact that the coffee shop would turn a profit if anyone orders coffee indicates that each individual's coffee purchase can be a cause of the profit on that day. The model, however, seems to attribute the cause to collective action, and therefore answers "No," suggesting that Drew's action alone is not the cause.

This might be due to several reasons:

1. Non-Linearity of Cause: The prompt does not explicitly mention cases where multiple factors could lead to a result. The model might interpret the question from a linear cause-effect point of view, negating the fact that more than one cause can lead to a result happening.

2. Ambiguity: The phrase "answer questions about causal attribution" is open-ended and could be interpreted in various ways. It’s not clear that it should consider scenarios where more than one action can cause an effect.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clear Explanation of Causation: Include a portion in the prompt which explains how multiple independent actions can also cause an outcome. This will make the model understand the non-linear nature of cause and effect better.

2. Concrete Example: Using examples that showcase the multiple cause and effect scenario will make the model understand this concept better.

3. Reduction of Ambiguity: Make the explanation of "causal attribution" more detailed, mentioning that it should look at various factors that can independently lead to an outcome.

New prompt can be:
"Consider all direct and indirect factors that can cause an outcome, including any failures in communication or actions, misunderstandings, or circumstantial influences. Understand that there could be cases where multiple actions independently result in an effect. Keeping this in mind, answer questions about causal attribution". 

Using a revised prompt that includes these changes should help guide the model and lead to more accurate answers.

Customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is not subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and she sees that she is not. So, she changes her subscription status, and she subscribes to the email list. Because customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list, Laurie receives a free sample. Did Laurie receive a free sample because she changed her subscription status?

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is on. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's on. So, he does not change the position of knob A at all. Because the building would implode if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A?

gradient:
<1> 
Question: Did Laurie receive a free sample because she changed her subscription status?
Model's Prediction: (B) No
Correct Label: (A) Yes

Reason for Error: The model might be failing to associate Laurie's action of changing her subscription status as a direct cause for her receiving a free sample. The prompt may lead to ambiguity reasoning for the machine since there might be multiple possible causes for someone receiving a free sample, such as previous purchases or company generosity. However, in this context, changing the subscription status is the intended cause. 

<2> 
Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Model's Prediction: (A) Yes
Correct Label: (B) No

Reason for Error: The model seems to misunderstand causal attribution and the company policy. It attributed the occurrence to Alice's action, not considering that Zoe had already violated the policy by logging in at 9 am, which is a time reserved for Alice. This action by Zoe already puts the system at risk of sending an empty email, a factor that model seems to overlook or misunderstand. 

<3> 
Question: Did the building implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A?
Model's Prediction: (B) No
Correct Label: (A) Yes

Reason for Error: The language model might have focused more on Tom's inaction ("did not change the position of knob A") instead of the underlying condition that the knob's position was a direct cause for the building's implosion. The prompt may not make this clear enough, resulting in the wrong answer.

In all these instances, the model has issues with understanding the causal factors leading to the events and choosing the correct response accordingly.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Make the causal relationship in the questions clearer to help the model discern active versus passive factors, or actions versus inactions.
2. Include specific instructions to ensure the model takes all factors into consideration, especially when there are regulations or conditions involved.
3. Emphasize the importance of sequence or order of events in determining causality.
4. Ensure that the model understands the role of both primary and secondary conditions in causality.
5. Prompt to focus more on the specific context of the question rather than generalized causative relationships.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

gradient:
<1> 

Step by Step Analysis: 

a. Question Analysis: This question revolves around understanding moral intent. Specifically, whether Bob had the intention to harm the health of townspeople or not. The circumstances are that he has signed off on a plan that does cause harm, but his primary aim or interest lies in robbing the bank. 

b. Wrong Answer Analysis: The model's prediction is 'A) Yes', implying that Bob intentionally harmed the townspeople. However, according to the scenario, Bob's intent was not directly to harm the townspeople, but to rob the bank. The harm to the townspeople happens as a side effect.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1. The prompt doesn't clearly state that it needs to consider the person's specific intent, but more generally factors contributing to an outcome. Thus, it might not encourage the model to prioritize distinguishing the primary intent from the resulting consequences.

2. The prompt speaks about considering errors in communication or actions, misunderstandings, or environmental influences, which might drive the model to focus on the action's result rather than the intent behind it.

3. The prompt doesn't emphasize on differentiating between direct and indirect effects which may have lead it to consider Bob's intentional action of robbing the bank as causing townspeople's harm.

4. The complexity and length of the question/scenario might also add to the confusion.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt: 

1. Specify the importance of understanding the main intent of the characters involved to answer the question correctly. 

2. Emphasise the importance of distinguishing between direct and indirect consequences, especially in a case where an action leads to more than one outcome.  

3. Ensure the model is aware that it needs to carefully review the problem context and data to prevent misinterpretation of the situation. 

4. Simplify the instruction or provide clearer direction to avoid confusion. 

5. Modify it to not just consider the object-level factors (errors in communication or actions, misunderstandings, or environmental influences), but also assess the meta-level goal or intent.   

6. Encourage separate evaluations of direct impacts and indirect ripple effects in complex scenarios.

A critical factor that likely contributed to the model's incorrect answer is the way causation is framed in the prompt. The prompt asks for evaluation of direct and indirect factors contributing to an outcome. The wording could have led the model to attribute the problem to both Suzy and Billy's simultaneous login and the company's policy, instead of solely attributing it to Suzy's action. The model seems to follow a single cause-to-effect logic, rather than acknowledging multiple independent sources of causation. 

Example 2: 
This example also involves multiple causes leading to the same outcome. Similar to the first question, the framing of the prompt seems to have led the model to connect a single action (Drew's coffee order) to the outcome (profit), although the profit was independently caused by any of the customers' orders. The model overlooks the fact that the coffee shop would have made a profit even if Drew hadn't ordered, and hence Drew's particular role was not a necessary cause.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Multiple Causes: The prompt should explicitly state that the task involves identifying the role of an individual factor in a scenario where multiple factors independently lead to the same outcome. 

2. Independent Causes: The prompt should underscore the importance of considering each act or event independently of others when assessing its role in the outcome. 

3. Responsibility identification: Encourage the model to identify the causes beyond the single cause-to-effect logic and accommodate shared or divided causation into account.

4. Clear Causation: Highlight that the question relates to causation, not blame. The model should understand that even if several elements contribute to the outcome, an individual action can still be considered a cause.

Finally, the model may benefit from a prompt that makes it clear that this task involves considering hypothetical scenarios in which one factor is removed to see if the outcome would still have occurred. This may help the model better understand the concept of "necessary" and "sufficient" causes for an outcome.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Evaluate all direct and indirect factors contributing to an outcome, considering errors in communication or actions, misunderstandings, or environmental influences. Bear in mind that multiple individual actions can each independently result in an effect, ensuring a comprehensive view of causal attribution. Under these conditions, answer questions regarding what or who caused a certain outcome.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Under these conditions, answer questions regarding what or who caused a certain outcome.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer:
No, Suzy did not cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information. It was a result of both Billy and Suzy being logged in at the same time, which was not known to cause the deletion of emails. It was a combination of their actions and the lack of awareness of the consequences of simultaneous logins.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Kylie and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. However, Drew doesn't usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, unexpectedly, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, and Oliver also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?

An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instructions and only bought and used the chemical A X200R. However, Benni tells him that he had used the chemical B Y33R instead. He still had some bottles of this chemical in stock at home and wanted to use them up. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (B) No, as Mr. Carlson did not intentionally choose a dish that would cause Karen harm and was not aware of her rare hereditary disease. The direct factor contributing to Karen's death was her rare disease, not Mr. Carlson's choice of dish. However, indirect factors such as lack of communication about Karen's dietary restrictions and environmental influences (the presence of wine in the dish) also played a role in the outcome.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

The reason provided by the model for considering the pharmacist as caused for patients recovery is incorrect because the prompt doesn't cleanly define the difference between involved in the process and causing the outcome. While the pharmacist was involved in the process by confirming the drug's availability, they did not have a determining say in the patient's medication and thus didn't directly caused the patient's recovery.

<2> 

In this case, the failure arises from the model's inability to distinguish between dependant and independent actions well. The model assumes that since Joe's first choice was a requisite for him to win, it therefore caused the win. However, both choices had to be successful for him to win, making them independently integral and thus neither of them can be singled out as the 'cause' of the win.

<3> 

The model failed in this example because it didn't correctly account for the environmental influences. The combined application of both fertilizers by Alex and Benni contributed to the plants drying out, not just Benni’s individual application of B Y33R. The prompt needs to better emphasize the consideration of collective actions leading to an effect.

<4> 

This case failed because of the model's difficulty in identifying causation when ignorance or mistakes are involved. Mr. Carlson unknowingly chose a dish with wine, which led to Karen's death. Given his ignorance, however, the model considered him not the cause.

Prompt Improvement:

1. Define and distinguish more clearly between direct and indirect causality.
2. Enlighten that an individual's involvement in a chain of events doesn't necessarily directly lead to an outcome.
3. Emphasize the importance of seeking for the most direct, decisive causes.
4. Make a clearer distinction between independent and dependent actions.
5. Specify that collective contributions to an outcome should be considered.
6. Clarify that even actions done unknowingly or by mistake can be the cause of an outcome.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

Evaluate all direct and indirect influences, accommodating any shortcomings in communication, actions, misunderstandings or circumstantial elements. Place importance on observing normative or rule-related factors and differentiating required (necessary) and adequate (sufficient) conditions for an event. Also, recognize the potential co-existence of multiple causes, be they alternative or simultaneous, and realize that multiple elements may collectively contribute to an event's causation.

Place importance on observing normative or rule-related factors and differentiating required (necessary) and adequate (sufficient) conditions for an event. Also, recognize the potential co-existence of multiple causes, be they alternative or simultaneous, and realize that multiple elements may collectively contribute to an event's causation. Using this comprehensive appreciation, respond to the following questions about causal attribution.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend tells him it's a precious heirloom and he can't part with it. Bill waits until later when his friend is in the bathroom, and slips the bookend into his bag. Finally, Bill leaves his friend's house with the stolen right-side Bartlett bookend in his bag. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (B) No, as Bill's actions of stealing the bookend do not directly cause them to possess the paired set of bookends. Sue's purchase of the left-side bookend is what ultimately led to them having the paired set. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: B

In this example, the model's failure seems to revolve around a simplistic interpretation of causation which is designed quantitatively upon direct influences rather than taking into account indirect influences or multi-causal factors as outlined in the original prompt. The model disregards Bill's unauthorized act of taking the bookend as a cause that led to the possession of the paired set of bookends. 

Reasoning for the failure:

1. The model seemed to focus too much on direct causation, in this case Sue's action of buying a bookend. The prediction ignored Bill's act which was also a direct cause as they wouldn’t possess the pair if Bill hadn’t taken the other half.

2. The prompt's requirement to differentiate between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions wasn't properly followed by the model. In this case, it's 'necessary' for Bill to take the bookend, and 'sufficient' for Sue to buy the other for them to have a pair.

3. The model failed to recognize the potential of multiple causes playing a role in resulting in the final outcome.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Further clarify in the prompt that a direct cause isn't necessarily the 'only' or 'most significant' defining factor for an event or outcome, and that indirect influences or alternative courses of action could also substantially contribute in a multi-causal scenario.

2. Reinforce the distinction between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions and the importance of considering both in answering causation questions.

3. Include instructions for the model to consider potential simultaneous and/or alternative causes that resulted in the final outcome.

4. The prompt could also benefit from a clearer definition of what constitutes 'causation' to help the model make better causal attributions.

5. Ask the model not to interpret causation strictly in the linear sense of one immediate action leading to an outcome, but to understand that several actions across a stretch of time can contribute to the final outcome.

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet could possibly hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

Wrong Example Reasonings:
<1>
1. The prompt is heavily geared towards promoting a comprehensive evaluation of all possible direct and indirect influences on an event. This can lead to the model overfitting on complex cause-effect relationships, thereby making inferences that may not align with a 'typical' person's simplistic interpretation of causation. In this case, the model might interpret the hunter's indifference to the bird-watcher's safety as an intentional act to harm them, while a usual person would only see it as negligence or recklessness, not intent to harm.
2. Additionally, the prompt emphasizes identifying normative or rule-related factors, which could have steered the model to conclude that since the hunter decided to shoot despite knowing the presence and potential danger to the bird-watchers, it was an intentional act of misconduct, deviating from usual hunting norms.
3. The prompt also instructs the model to differentiate between necessary and sufficient conditions for an event, which might lead to misinterpretations. In this case, the shooting of the bird-watcher was a possibility but not a necessity for the hunter to win the competition.
4. While the prompt insists on considering multiple alternative or simultaneous causes, in this instance, there's a clear and single causative action, making such contemplation unnecessary and possibly misleading.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Modify the prompt to suggest that the model should gauge consequences based on the actor's primary intent rather than all possible outcomes, especially in scenarios involving collateral outcomes.
2. Tone down the significance of observing normative or rule-related factors to prevent the model from overemphasizing implications of rules or norms in causal attribution.
3. Clarify the distinction between necessary and sufficient conditions in the prompt to avoid confusion. Clear instructions to evaluate whether an outcome was the primary goal or an incidental result of an action could be beneficial.
4. In situations where a single cause-effect relationship is evident, ensure that the model doesn't overcomplicate by seeking multiple causes. Perhaps instructions to simplify and focus on the most direct and clear causative action would avoid errors.
5. Lastly, the prompt could also benefit from clarifying how a 'typical' person perceives intent, causation, and responsibility. It may facilitate appropriate answers even in scenarios involving elements like recklessness or indifference.

At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: "I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can." Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: "What? You funneled A X200R into the blue can? But you told me you had funneled it into the green can! That's why I always used the green can!" Alex replies: "Did I? Then I am sorry!" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if the fertilization by Benni caused the plants to dry out, we need to consider the causal factors involved in the situation. In this scenario, Tom instructed both Alex and Benni to use only the chemical A X200R for fertilization. However, due to a miscommunication between Alex and Benni, Benni ended up using the chemical B Y33R on some of the plants instead.

Given that Tom had read that using multiple different types of chemicals can damage plants, it is likely that the plants that dried out were negatively affected by the unintended application of the chemical B Y33R. Since only Benni applied this incorrect fertilizer, it can be inferred that the drying out of the plants was caused by Benni's fertilization error.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No <answer></answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example 1: 
The problem here seems to be a discrepancy between the moral reasoning often used in causal attribution (because the hedgehog was unaware of the rule, he cannot be held responsible) and the technical event-related causation (the hedgehog did contribute to the depletion of pencils). The model selects the answer based on the lack of moral culpability on the part of the hedgehog, but the question is asking about direct cause-and-effect. The prompt does not make clear that the answer should be based on causal attribution without considering moral implications or responsibility. 

For example 2: 
The model's wrong answer comes from a misunderstanding of the source of the problem. A possible issue here is the complexity and length of the story, leading the model to miss the important detail that the plants dried up on flower beds where both chemicals were applied, regardless of who applied them. The length of the scenario could be distracting the model from focusing on the normative or rule-related factors. This wouldn't actually be an issue with the prompt, but rather a difficulty for the AI to maintain focus on the important details.

Based on these issues, these are the aspects that could improve the prompt: 

1. Make it clear that the prompt seeks a causal attribution based solely on the description of the events, without considering moral implications or responsibility.
2. Request for an important timeline chronology, or a cause-effect relationship map. This would ensure that the prompt reminds the AI to maintain focus on the important details of the story, even when it's lengthy or complex. 
3. Ask the AI to explicitly list the identified causes before providing an answer - this might help it process and understand the text better. 
4. Request the AI to consider and evaluate all the rules, norms, and instructions given in the scenario before making a decision, emphasizing again that the focus is on factual and event-based causality. 
5. Encourage the AI to refute wrong options based on the scenario to solidify its understanding of the event.

gradient:
<1> 
For this question, the prompt seems to overemphasis on the acknowledgment of the factors contributing to an effect. The prompt leads the model to the conclusion that the coin flip was a factor contributing to the outcome of winning the game. However, in the context, both the coin flip and dice roll are equally and independently important for Alex to win the game. The slight misinterpretation of instruction in this scenario has led the model to predict the wrong answer.

<2> 
In this example, the prompt might have failed due to an inaccurate interpretation of "intentional cause". The model might have been lead to believe that the sniper did not intend to heat the barrel simply because he didn't pay attention to it. However, in reality, the sniper intentionally pulled the trigger which in turn intentionally caused the barrel to heat up, despite his indifference to it. The instruction fails to capture nuance in intentionality in cause-effect relationships.

<3> 
The failing in this question is once again the model's misunderstanding of the prompt's instruction about acknowledging multiple causes. The model concluded that Kate's not oiling the machine did not contribute to the machine's breakdown, as it wasn't her responsibility. However, despite the job responsibility, the model should still consider actions or inactions that directly affect outcomes, contributing to cause-effect relationships.

Based on the above issues, the following points can be made to improve the prompt:

1. The prompt should clarify that all contributing factors, whether they are conditions or active contributions, are equally important in a cause-effect relationship, especially when multiple factors are equally necessary for an outcome.

2. The prompt should make it clear that intentionality in cause-effect relations can manifest even in actions that are indifferent towards certain outcomes. The model should evaluate intention based on the action taken, not the actor's express focus or indifference towards the outcome.

3. The model should be guided to understand that even actions or inactions falling outside of individuals' prescribed responsibilities can contribute to an outcome in a cause-effect scenario, and that these should be taken into consideration when determining causal relationships.

The failing in this question is once again the model's misunderstanding of the prompt's instruction about acknowledging multiple causes. The model concluded that Kate's not oiling the machine did not contribute to the machine's breakdown, as it wasn't her responsibility. However, despite the job responsibility, the model should still consider actions or inactions that directly affect outcomes, contributing to cause-effect relationships.

Based on the above issues, the following points can be made to improve the prompt:

1. The prompt should clarify that all contributing factors, whether they are conditions or active contributions, are equally important in a cause-effect relationship, especially when multiple factors are equally necessary for an outcome.

2. The prompt should make it clear that intentionality in cause-effect relations can manifest even in actions that are indifferent towards certain outcomes. The model should evaluate intention based on the action taken, not the actor's express focus or indifference towards the outcome.

3. The model should be guided to understand that even actions or inactions falling outside of individuals' prescribed responsibilities can contribute to an outcome in a cause-effect scenario, and that these should be taken into consideration when determining causal relationships.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is not in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He changes its position, and he puts it in the lock position. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?

gradient:
<1>
The wrong answer in this situation can be due to a couple of reasons: 

1. The prompt might not provide clear guidance on the consideration of multiple causes. The question states that the motorboat would start with either the gear being in neutral or the motor being in the lock position. In the sequence, Ned indeed changed the position of the motor, but this change didn't have any influence since the circumstances already met the condition (gear being in neutral) for the boat to start. The model, however, fell into the trap of assuming a cause-effect relationship by the sequence of the events, ignoring the condition that was met before/initiated earlier, which was the actual cause.

2. The model seems to be influenced by the chronological order and immediate events rather than the actual influence and necessity of the event for causing an effect. The action Ned performed is the latest event in the chronology so it might be considered the cause, even though it's inessential.

3. The prompt, although it mentions the acknowledgment of multiple causes contributing to a single effect, doesn't elaborate on assessing the actual requirement and influence of these causes before assigning cause-effect relationship. 

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Highlight the importance of considering the relevant conditions or circumstances where an event happens.

2. The need for assessing each contribution to the effect, determining if a cause is necessary and/or sufficient.

3. More emphasis on reasoning about the actual influence of an event on the outcome beyond the chronological order of events.

4. Directing the model to be cautious of cause-effect fallacies resulting from the immediacy or sequential nature of an event, and to adopt a more critical thinking approach.

5. Asking the model to weigh the significance of each cause in scenarios where multiple causes are present. 

This can translate to the following improved prompt: "Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions critically, verifying their actual necessity and sufficiency in causing the effect. Be cautious of the chronological order but not misled by it, and treat each event based on its actual influence and relevance to the outcome. In scenarios with multiple causes contributing to a single effect, weigh the significance of each cause accurately, avoiding cause-effect fallacies resulting from immediacy or sequence."

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet could possibly hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

gradient:
Question Examination: 
The question is a hypothetical situation about a hunter aiming to shoot a deer but possibly hitting a bird-watcher due to their position behind the deer. The cause and effect question posed here is whether the man intentionally shot the bird-watcher or not.

Wrong Answer Analysis: 
The language model's response is incorrect because it interprets the hunter's indifference to the risk of hitting the bird-watchers as an intention to shoot them. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of intent versus neglecting or dismissing potential consequences. The prompt's emphasis on direct and indirect contributions in establishing cause-effect relationships can lead the model to equate the acknowledgement of a possible outcome (the hunter acknowledging the risk of hitting a bird-watcher) with the intention to cause that outcome. In actuality, causation doesn't necessarily imply intent.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Specify degree of cause: The prompt could clarify the distinction between actions that cause a result and actions that intentionally cause a result. This would help the model not to confuse events that are caused (in a broad sense) with events that are caused intentionally.

2. Redefine the scope of direct and indirect causes: The model may need guidance about considering unexpected or unintended outcomes as indirect causes, even though they result directly from the original action. The "direct" and "indirect" terms might be prompting the model to place more weight on outcomes that are directly linked to an action, irrespective of intent.

3. Emphasize perspectives and motivations: The prompt might be improved by emphasizing a deeper analysis of the actors' motivations and state of mind during the events. This would help the model better evaluate the intent behind actions.

4. Clarify the interpretation of scenarios: The prompt could provide guidance on evaluating hypothetical scenarios, distinguishing between imminent risks that are disregarded and actual harm caused intentionally.

5. Consider multiple layers of causality: The prompt should instruct the model to take into account the complexity of causal relationships and understand that the existence of causation doesn't necessarily equate to intention.

6. Limitation on 'cause and effect' assumptions: The model seems to interpret 'cause and effect' slightly narrowly, assuming that if an effect occurs, it was invariably caused directly by preceding actions. A note of caution to avoid such assumptions might be added to the prompt.

In summary, the prompt, while instructive for basic cause-and-effect relationships, may lead to oversimplifications in complex scenarios that involve implicit intent, unforeseen consequences, and neglect of risks.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?

(A) Yes
(B) No

Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Model's Answer: No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The cause of the circuit breaker failing was the combination of three people turning on their lamps at the same time, not just Jim turning on his lamp. 

Detailed Analysis:
The model failed to use the principle of causality correctly. It saw the event as requiring all three individuals to turn on their lamps, and thus viewed it as a collective cause rather than an individual cause-effect relationship. However, the question is indeed looking at an individual cause-effect event, which in this case is Jim's contribution (turning on his lamp) to the overall effect (the circuit breaker failing).

Question: Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?
Model's Answer: The misadministration of medication did not cause John's premature death. The highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer, caused by exposure to asbestos, was the primary factor leading to his death. The medication error may have contributed to his death, but it was not the primary cause.

Detailed Analysis:
The model identified the lung cancer as the main causal factor and thus ignored the immediate trigger which was the wrong medication. This might be due to its emphasis on both direct and indirect influences, and the evaluation of each event based on contribution and relevance. However, the model needs to understand that multiple causes can contribute to a single effect.

Question: Did the fact that the red wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Model's Answer: A typical person might answer (A) Yes.

Detailed Analysis:
This answer was classified as wrong because it concluded with the wrong option: "(B) No". The model had correctly reasoned that a typical person might say yes, but it went wrong in expressing its final answer.

Summary of Aspects that Can Improve the Prompt: 

1. Strengthen the understanding of cause-effect relationships: The model needs to identify and handle individual cause-effect events better, acknowledging that simultaneous causes resulting in an effect are individually contributing to that effect.

2. Examine immediacy of causes: The model needs to evaluate both the remote and immediate causes for their direct contribution to the outcome. It should take into account not only chronic or ongoing causes but also the immediate triggers for an event.

3. Improve conclusion alignment: The model should align the conclusive text with the bracketed response to avoid errors as in example 3.

4. Prevent misunderstanding of options: Clarify that multiple causes can indeed contribute to one effect, aiming to avoid the misunderstanding which happened in the second sample. 

5. Use more layman-friendly language: To ensure the effectiveness of the instructions, use simpler language whenever possible. This can help to lessen the complexity of the prompt and make it more easily digestible for the model. 

The revised prompt would look like: 

Analyze the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect on both direct and immediate, as well as indirect and chronic influences when addressing cause-effect relationships. Evaluate each event for its unique contribution to the outcome without bias of sequence or the presence of multiple causes. If several causes lead to a single effect, take into account the individual contribution of each cause. Be cautious not to assume that all causes must be present for an event to happen, recognizing that sometimes an effect can be triggered by a sole immediate cause. Be sure to provide an answer that matches the final option chosen.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did misadministration of medication cause John's premature death?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. When Tom meets Alex in the garden shortly afterwards, he instructs him to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. He also explicitly instructs him to tell Benni to only use A X200R. Alex volunteers to buy several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself and to tell Benni about Tom's instruction. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex immediately starts apologizing: "I am sorry! I completely forgot to tell Benni about the rule! I bought and used the chemical A X200R but Benni must have used something else because he did not know about the new rule." Benni tells Tom that Alex had not told him that they were only supposed to use A X200R. He explains: "I have used the fertilizer I previously used; it is called B Y33R!" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did Alex cause the plant to dry out?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the model incorrectly answered (B) No to the question of whether Alex caused the plants to dry out. The text specifically mentions that the plants dried up in the flower beds where both A X200R and B Y33R were applied. Because Alex did not relay Tom's instructions to Benni, B Y33R was also used, leading to the situation where both chemicals were used on the same plants. 

The wrong answer could be due to several reasons. 

1. Lack of clarity on cause-effect: Although the model was prompted to reflect critically on direct and indirect influences, it may have struggled to establish that Alex's failure to communicate signals an indirect cause that led to the plants drying out. 

2. Complexity of causality: The situation represents a case where two causes (the applications of A X200R and B Y33R) led to the same effect, making the causality of the scenario more complex. The prompt did not sufficiently guide the model to navigate such a scenario effectively.

3. Simplification of omitting causes: The model may have focused too much on the immediate cause (Benni using B Y33R) and ignored the previous actions that led to this cause (Alex's failure). This might imply the model oversimplified the case.

Wrong Example 2:
Here, the model wrongly answered (A) Yes to whether the black wire touching the battery caused the machine to short circuit. The question hints that the catastrophic event (short-circuit) only happened when BOTH wires connected to the battery. The black wire was designed to touch the battery; thus, this event didn't deviate from its intended function so should not be seen as the cause.

The wrong answer may have resulted from:

1. Misinterpretation of intended functionality: The model did not interpret the "intended function" of the wires correctly; while the black wire was supposed to touch the battery, the red wire was the abnormal factor that caused the short circuit.

2. Insufficient evaluation of necessity and sufficiency: Despite the prompt's instruction to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, the model incorrectly judged the black wire touching the battery as both necessary and sufficient for a short circuit.

Improvements on the Prompt:
1. Include a clearer guideline on evaluating indirect influences and complicating factors when multiple causes lead to a single effect.
2. Emphasise the necessity to consider the usual and intended functionalities, changes, or deviations within the context. This is critical in accurately assessing the causes.
3. Reinforce the instruction on thorough evaluation of each event's necessity and sufficiency in contributing to an outcome, especially in situations with multiple contributing factors.
4. Encourage consideration of overlooked actions or 'omissions' as potential causes.
5. Incorporate the need to differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes.' Kannada reordering the prompt to prioritize these points may help the model incrementally improve its decision-making process.

In the first example, the model incorrectly answered (B) No to the question of whether Alex caused the plants to dry out. The text specifically mentions that the plants dried up in the flower beds where both A X200R and B Y33R were applied. Because Alex did not relay Tom's instructions to Benni, B Y33R was also used, leading to the situation where both chemicals were used on the same plants. 

The wrong answer could be due to several reasons. 

1. Lack of clarity on cause-effect: Although the model was prompted to reflect critically on direct and indirect influences, it may have struggled to establish that Alex's failure to communicate signals an indirect cause that led to the plants drying out. 

2. Complexity of causality: The situation represents a case where two causes (the applications of A X200R and B Y33R) led to the same effect, making the causality of the scenario more complex. The prompt did not sufficiently guide the model to navigate such a scenario effectively.

3. Simplification of omitting causes: The model may have focused too much on the immediate cause (Benni using B Y33R) and ignored the previous actions that led to this cause (Alex's failure). This might imply the model oversimplified the case.

Wrong Example 2:
Here, the model wrongly answered (A) Yes to whether the black wire touching the battery caused the machine to short circuit. The question hints that the catastrophic event (short-circuit) only happened when BOTH wires connected to the battery. The black wire was designed to touch the battery; thus, this event didn't deviate from its intended function so should not be seen as the cause.

The wrong answer may have resulted from:

1. Misinterpretation of intended functionality: The model did not interpret the "intended function" of the wires correctly; while the black wire was supposed to touch the battery, the red wire was the abnormal factor that caused the short circuit.

2. Insufficient evaluation of necessity and sufficiency: Despite the prompt's instruction to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, the model incorrectly judged the black wire touching the battery as both necessary and sufficient for a short circuit.

Improvements on the Prompt:
1. Include a clearer guideline on evaluating indirect influences and complicating factors when multiple causes lead to a single effect.
2. Emphasise the necessity to consider the usual and intended functionalities, changes, or deviations within the context. This is critical in accurately assessing the causes.
3. Reinforce the instruction on thorough evaluation of each event's necessity and sufficiency in contributing to an outcome, especially in situations with multiple contributing factors.
4. Encourage consideration of overlooked actions or 'omissions' as potential causes.
5. Incorporate the need to differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes.' Kannada reordering the prompt to prioritize these points may help the model incrementally improve its decision-making process.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is on. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's on. So, he does not change the position of knob A at all. Because the building would implode if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, the building did not implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A. The building imploded because both the safety switch was off and knob A was switched on, regardless of Tom's actions. <B>Answer: (B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1> Current Prompt Issue: The instruction of the prompt may be misinterpreted by the model, particularly the section that states "evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome". In this scenario, the model may have perceived that Tom's inaction (not switching knob A) was not a 'true' contribution, hence leading to the incorrect answer.

Reason: A major point of contention in the given scenario is the concept of "inaction" and whether it can contribute to an outcome. The example opted for the stance that a lack of action can indeed serve as a cause, however, the language model seems to assume that meaningful cause must be characterized by active participation or change.

Improvement: The prompt could be made more explicit when it comes to the concept of inaction. For instance, it could specify that 'actions' may include a continuation of the original state, or not making changes when changes were possible. 

2> Current Prompt Issue: Overemphasis on "sequence" might have led the model to discard Tom's action as insignificant because it happened after the condition necessary for the building implosion was already fulfilled.

Reason: The model could have been influenced by the prompt's instruction to keep track of "chronological order", interpreting Tom's inaction as inconsequential since the necessary conditions for the building's implosion were already in place before his intervention.

Improvement: The potential for overemphasis on chronological order can be mitigated by including a reminder that not changing something can be just as causative as changing something.

3> Current Prompt Issue: The mention of "more than one cause" might have led the model to associate a cause with an active action, therefore overlooking Tom's passive contribution.

Reason: The model might be biased towards identifying clear, active changes as causes and ignoring less explicit, passive causes. This could be due to the instruction about considering multiple causes, which may be interpreted by the model as a search for alterative, active factors.

Improvement: Provide guidance that both active and passive actions (or inactions) can contribute to the ultimate outcome. The model should not be biased by the nature of the action and must evaluate based on it's relevance to the outcome regardless of how direct or indirect it might be.

Based on the issues identified above, the improved prompt should:

- Specify that both actions and inactions can contribute to an outcome.
- Emphasize the importance of evaluating the relevance of the action to the outcome regardless of the nature of the action (active or passive).
- Include guidance that chronological order of events does not dictate the significance of each event in leading to an outcome.
- Encourage the model to be more open in identifying causes, not solely associating a cause-effect relationship with active actions, while still guarding against multiple cause assumptions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer.

The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Question: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?

In this example, the model predictively responded "B) No". The correct response, however, was "A) Yes". The model's error seems to stem from misinterpretation of the causal relationships presented in the problem. The model might have misunderstood the conditions that allowed the motorboat to start and so it incorrectly linked the effect (motorboat starting) to the lack of action from Ned (not changing the position of the motor). The ability to interpret the logical correlations between the causes correctly would improve accuracy.

Example 2:

Question: Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?

In this example, the model also provided an incorrect answer "B) No", when the correct response was "A) Yes". The instructions might have misled the model by overemphasizing the need to look for a singular cause. The question posed might be interpreted as being directed towards identifying if Suzy was the only cause for the emails being deleted. However, in the described context, both Suzy and Billy's actions combined caused the emails to be deleted and that doesn't negate Suzy's contribution to the outcome. This case shows that the model might have difficulties understanding causation in situations where multiple causes contribute to the effect.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Clearer Instruction: The prompt could provide simpler and more explicit instruction about considering situations with multiple causations. The current instructions seem to imply that there should be a singular cause to an effect which might not always be the case.

2. Focus on Outcome: The instructions should stress more on assessing the outcome and working backwards to establish the cause(s) rather than keeping an eye only on the order of events.

3. Multiple Influences: Include in the instructions that sometimes effects could be precipitated by singular or multiple influences, and that effect might be a result of a combination of actions.

4. Clearer Language: The language used in the prompt is quite complex, with numerous variables to consider, which may lead to an information overload or confusion to the model. Breaking down or simplifying the language and instruction set to make it more digestible might improve understanding and accuracy. 

5. Scenario Specification: Ideally, the instructions would be tailored to each specific scenario, addressing the unique causal relationships in each case while providing a general framework to guide the analysis. However, given that this isn't feasible, the instructions should be general enough to apply to varied scenarios but it should specifically address the need to consider all potential causes, their interactions, and the overall impact.

Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?

Investigate the chain of events and their ensuing repercussions. Contemplate both proximate and remote influences when dissecting the queries about cause-effect correlations. Keeping a keen eye on the order of events, avoid any predisposition caused by immediacy or progression. Place importance on evaluating each incident for its specific impact on the final outcome. In cases where numerous causes culminate in a singular effect, individually assess the contribution of each cause. Stay vigilant against presumptions arising out of the order of events or multiple causes. Recognize the significance of immediate triggers as well as long-standing causes in your analysis. Be consistent in voicing the conclusion with the chosen response option to avoid confusion. Remember that sometimes, an effect could be precipitated by just one immediate cause in the presence of multiple potential causes.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by saying:

No, Suzy did not cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information. It was the simultaneous logging in of both Billy and Suzy that triggered the deletion of the emails. Suzy logging in at the same time as Billy was just a contributing factor, not the sole cause.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1: 

Question: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?

In this example, the model predictively responded "B) No". The correct response, however, was "A) Yes". The model's error seems to stem from misinterpretation of the causal relationships presented in the problem. The model might have misunderstood the conditions that allowed the motorboat to start and so it incorrectly linked the effect (motorboat starting) to the lack of action from Ned (not changing the position of the motor). The ability to interpret the logical correlations between the causes correctly would improve accuracy.

Example 2:

Question: Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?

In this example, the model also provided an incorrect answer "B) No", when the correct response was "A) Yes". The instructions might have misled the model by overemphasizing the need to look for a singular cause. The question posed might be interpreted as being directed towards identifying if Suzy was the only cause for the emails being deleted. However, in the described context, both Suzy and Billy's actions combined caused the emails to be deleted and that doesn't negate Suzy's contribution to the outcome. This case shows that the model might have difficulties understanding causation in situations where multiple causes contribute to the effect.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Clearer Instruction: The prompt could provide simpler and more explicit instruction about considering situations with multiple causations. The current instructions seem to imply that there should be a singular cause to an effect which might not always be the case.

2. Focus on Outcome: The instructions should stress more on assessing the outcome and working backwards to establish the cause(s) rather than keeping an eye only on the order of events.

3. Multiple Influences: Include in the instructions that sometimes effects could be precipitated by singular or multiple influences, and that effect might be a result of a combination of actions.

4. Clearer Language: The language used in the prompt is quite complex, with numerous variables to consider, which may lead to an information overload or confusion to the model. Breaking down or simplifying the language and instruction set to make it more digestible might improve understanding and accuracy. 

5. Scenario Specification: Ideally, the instructions would be tailored to each specific scenario, addressing the unique causal relationships in each case while providing a general framework to guide the analysis. However, given that this isn't feasible, the instructions should be general enough to apply to varied scenarios but it should specifically address the need to consider all potential causes, their interactions, and the overall impact.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.
(3) Investigate the chain of events and their ensuing repercussions. Contemplate both proximate and remote influences when dissecting the queries about cause-effect correlations. Keeping a keen eye on the order of events, avoid any predisposition caused by immediacy or progression. Place importance on evaluating each incident for its specific impact on the final outcome. In cases where numerous causes culminate in a singular effect, individually assess the contribution of each cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils from the box before the polar bear arrived.

The model's input and response analysis:

Current prompt is emphasizing on contemplating both proximate(i.e., recent) and remote(i.e., distant) influences and assessing the progression of the events to correlate the cause-effect relationship. Also, it instructs the model to stay vigilant against presumptions arising out of the order of events or multiple causes. However, in the provided case, the model seems to focus more on the hedgehog's innocence (as it did not know about the new rule) rather than looking at the broader chain of events. The prompt did not direct the model effectively to consider both the bear's and the hedgehog's actions as participating factors to the problem. 

Reasons for incorrect answer:
1. The prompt over-emphasises the significance of immediate triggers and long-standing causes. While this is useful in some situations, in this particular instance, it led the model to attribute significance primarily to the hedgehog's ignorance of the rules, rather than considering the entire chain of events.
2. The prompt emphasizes too much on avoiding any predisposition caused by immediacy or progression and this has resulted in overlooking the fact that both animals took pencils alternately and caused the problem.
3. The prompt lacks clarity on how to handle cases where joint actions can cause an effect. In this case, the hedgehog did contribute to the problem, even though it wasn’t the sole cause.

Improvements:
1. Instruction might be amplified to guide the model to equally consider all cause of events, reducing its leaning towards empathy or specific biases.
2. The prompt should direct the model to take into account the cumulative effects of joint actions in causality.
3. The prompt should urge the model to make a distinction between causing a problem and being the only cause of a problem.
4. It should be emphasized that an action can be a contributing cause to a problem, even if it's not the main or the only cause.

Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did Brown intentionally roll a six?
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Correct Answer: (A) Yes

Analysis: 
In this question, the language model seems to have misinterpreted the causal relationship between Brown rolling a six and the ensuing effect, which is the detonation of the bomb. Even though he is relying on luck to roll a six, once he achieves the result, the consequence, i.e., detonation of the bomb, becomes intentional since it's the goal of his action. Hence the complexity of human intent and causality might not be fully captured by the prompt.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Unclear Instructions: The prompt could be clearer about the intricacies of human intent and causality. The complexity of intent, especially in this case, where Brown's actions were deliberate but their success depended on luck might have confused the language model.

2. Misinterpretation of "Multiple potential causes": The prompt urges the model to consider situations where an effect could be caused by one immediate cause in the presence of multiple potential causes. In this example, the model may not have understood that though rolling a six was based on chance, it was intentional on Brown's part.

3. Overemphasis on "Immediate triggers": The prompt asks the model to recognize immediate triggers in its analysis, which could have resulted in bypassing the deliberation behind Brown's actions because the rolling of the dice is an immediate event.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Incorporate a clear explanation of the complexity of subjective intent and how that plays into causation.
2. Emphasise the need to consider multiple aspects of a scenario such as the intentions and plans of the individuals involved.
3. Potentially rephrase or remove the "multiple potential causes" clause or clearer define what is meant by 'multiple potential causes' and explicitly state the need to account for actions that are both deliberate yet dependent on chance.
4. Ensure the prompt asks the model to consider both the immediate actions and the larger context of intent in which they occur.

Hence the complexity of human intent and causality might not be fully captured by the prompt.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Unclear Instructions: The prompt could be clearer about the intricacies of human intent and causality. The complexity of intent, especially in this case, where Brown's actions were deliberate but their success depended on luck might have confused the language model.

2. Misinterpretation of "Multiple potential causes": The prompt urges the model to consider situations where an effect could be caused by one immediate cause in the presence of multiple potential causes. In this example, the model may not have understood that though rolling a six was based on chance, it was intentional on Brown's part.

3. Overemphasis on "Immediate triggers": The prompt asks the model to recognize immediate triggers in its analysis, which could have resulted in bypassing the deliberation behind Brown's actions because the rolling of the dice is an immediate event.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Incorporate a clear explanation of the complexity of subjective intent and how that plays into causation.
2. Emphasise the need to consider multiple aspects of a scenario such as the intentions and plans of the individuals involved.
3. Potentially rephrase or remove the "multiple potential causes" clause or clearer define what is meant by 'multiple potential causes' and explicitly state the need to account for actions that are both deliberate yet dependent on chance.
4. Ensure the prompt asks the model to consider both the immediate actions and the larger context of intent in which they occur.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.
(3) Investigate the chain of events and their ensuing repercussions. Contemplate both proximate and remote influences when dissecting the queries about cause-effect correlations. Keeping a keen eye on the order of events, avoid any predisposition caused by immediacy or progression. Place importance on evaluating each incident for its specific impact on the final outcome. In cases where numerous causes culminate in a singular effect, individually assess the contribution of each cause. Stay vigilant against presumptions arising out of the order of events or multiple causes. Recognize the significance of immediate triggers as well as long-standing causes in your analysis. Be consistent in voicing the conclusion with the chosen response option to avoid confusion. Remember that sometimes, an effect could be precipitated by just one immediate cause in the presence of multiple potential causes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did Joe cause his son's injury?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
In a particular building there are two businesses, a travel agency and a graphic design studio. The building's climate control system is a new design that saves energy by keeping track of the number of people in the building, and only turning on when enough people have entered the building. The climate control system will turn on when the people who work at the travel agency or the people who work in the design studio arrive for work. Each office has enough employees to turn on the climate control system on their own. The travel agency employees almost always arrive at 8:45 am, and the design studio employees almost always arrive at 8:45 am. Today, the travel agency employees arrived at 8:45 am. The design studio employees also arrived at 8:45 am, as usual. So, today, the climate control system turned on at 8:45 am. Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The design studio employees arriving at 8:45 am did not cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am. The system is designed to turn on when a sufficient number of people enter the building, regardless of which office they work in. Therefore, the design studio employees' arrival time is not the direct cause of the system turning on.

Wrong Example Analysis:

Example <1>:

The prompt instructs the model to not let chronology of events sway its understanding of cause and effect and scrutinize the real impact of an event in relation to the outcome. However, the model seems to have taken a straightforward, casual approach, interpreting Joe's act of kindness as the direct cause of the accident. It did not consider if Joe's helpful act was necessary or sufficient to directly cause the accident. The actual immediate cause of injury is the neighbor's car being struck by a drunk driver, not Joe's delay. This oversight leads to an incorrect prediction.

Example <2>:

The prompt instructs the model to be careful of direct influences, and to ascertain the sufficiency of the event in causing the outcome. However, the scenario given in the question is one of over-determinacy, where multiple sufficient causes are present. The model wrongly decided that because the travel agency employees' arrival alone was enough to activate the alarm, the design studio employees' arrival didn't influence the outcome. The correct interpretation from the human perspective is that both groups arriving at the same time were causes of the system turning on.

Based on these, there are several aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Clarify how to treat scenarios with multiple sufficient causes.
2. Emphasize on discerning between direct and indirect influences.
3. Better elaborate on distinguishing between necessary and sufficient cause. In case of necessary causation, investigate if the outcome cannot occur without the presence of the event.
4. Underline the assessment of 'consequence' of an action, not just the action itself. This includes identifying 'immediate causes' vs 'peripheral or underlying causes'.
5. Detail how to handle complex sequences of events, understanding that later events can redefine the impact or causative nature of earlier events.
6. Stress on identifying the elements of chance, choice or contingency in the sequence of events.
7. Incorporate instructions for understanding human perspective when attributing the cause of a situation/event.

When a single effect is influenced by multiple events, remain disciplined in your analysis of the necessity - whether the event is indispensable for the outcome- and sufficiency - if the event in itself is adequate to cause the outcome - of each cause. Make it a point to assess the inherent and defined function of each event while disregarding any biases that may originate from their sequence or from concurrent causes. Look out for actions, omissions, or deviations from the expected norm that might have been overlooked and understand their potential significance in the cause-effect equation. Acknowledge both 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes' and appreciate their distinctions. In intricate scenarios where several causes are interwoven, endeavor to extricate each cause, focusing on its true contribution to the outcome. Brace against any presumptions stemming from traditional sequences or connections of events within the given context. Comprehend the elements of chance, choice or contingency in the unfolding of events. Incorporate understanding from a human perspective when attributing causes to the situation at hand. Be especially attentive when addressing scenarios with multiple sufficient causes and treat all possible influences uniformly without bias. Register that the event's consequence is as important if not more than the event in itself.
cur_prompt: Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes.

Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that when the bullet travels through the air it will definitely disturb the air molecules around it. But the sniper doesn't care at all about disturbing air molecules, he just wants to shoot his target. So, he pulls the trigger. As the sniper expected, as the bullet travels from his gun into the enemy commander, it disturbed some air molecules. Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Janet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The model incorrectly predicts (A) Yes, the sniper intentionally disturbed some air molecules. The prompt puts a significant focus on considering the intended function of each event and indirect influences which "set the stage" for other events to occur. In this example, the model could have misunderstood the sniper’s intention to kill the enemy commander - a direct cause - as being tied with the indirect influence of disturbing the air molecules - an unrelated outcome. This is because it may be over-generalizing and considering all resulting effects from an event as an intended consequence.

Example 2:
The model incorrectly goes for (B) No, the device is not fully charged because Wayne did not change the position. The prompt emphasizes on the necessity and sufficiency of an event for the final outcome. Wayne keeping the device on the charging pad was both necessary and sufficient for it to charge. However, the model might have been confused by the abstract nature of non-action, leading to the wrong prediction.

Example 3:
The model erroneously answers (B) No, Kate not putting the oil did not cause the machine to break down. The prompt's focus on evaluating the "expected function" of an event might have led the model to concentrate on Janet's role as the person responsible to oil the machine. It downplayed the fact that Kate, despite not being explicitly responsible, could have prevented the machine's breakdown.

Improvement for the prompt:
1. Include guidelines for the model to distinctly evaluate actions and non-actions, as well as their potential effects on the outcome.
2. Instruct the model to consider responsibility and accountability in scenarios rather than relying only on explicit responsibilities.
3. Direct the model to carefully analyze the intention behind an action, differentiating between primary objectives and incidental results.
4. Contextualize the concepts of necessity and sufficiency better so that the model understands these in relation to the question scenarios.
5. Modify the instruction to let the model understand that not all effects resulting from an event are intentional.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.
(3) Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes. Be mindful of both direct influences - events that directly lead to a result - and indirect influences, which set the stage for other events to occur. Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence.

<START> Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes. Pay attention to both the direct influences - actions that immediately lead to a result - and indirect influences, which pave the way for consequential actions. In your analysis, keep in mind that chronological order is not necessarily an indicator of cause and effect. Instead, each event should be evaluated for its actual impact on the final outcome, regardless of its order. In scenarios where multiple events influence the outcome, hold a balanced approach to determine their necessity - whether the event must happen for the outcome and their sufficiency - can the event alone cause the outcome. Pay heed to intended actions versus incidental outcomes. Consider the conventional function of each event and possible omission, avoidance or deviation from norms, disregarding biases that may arise from event sequencing or presence of multiple causes. Understand that not all outcomes resulting from an event are purposefully intended. Highlight the difference between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. Take into account responsibility and potential intervention in the outcomes. In complex situations, aim to dissect interlaced causes, accurately assessing each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, while keeping clear of any tendency to make assumptions based on traditional sequencing or causality. Remember to equally evaluate impact of actions and non-actions on the final outcome. <END>

Pay particular attention to the intended and usual function of each event, disregarding bias that may result from their sequence or from the presence of more than one cause. Consider the possibility of overlooked actions, omissions, or deviations from expected patterns and their potential as cause factors. Always differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. In complex scenarios, strive to untangle multiple intertwined causes, focusing on each event's true contribution and relevance to the outcome and guarding against any presumption rising from the traditional order or connection of events in the given context.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The drunk driver did cause injury to Joe's son. However, it was not the direct cause of the injury. The direct cause was Joe's delay in picking up his child, which led to the neighbor taking the child home in his car, resulting in the accident with the drunk driver. Therefore, the drunk driver was an indirect cause of the injury to Joe's son.

In this instance, the model's answer is technically correct, but it's not what the original question was looking for. The question is asking if the drunk driver caused the injury to Joe's son. The model seems to have over-complicated the situation by considering other influencing factors such as Joe's delay. This indicates some confusion in the instructions for the task. The instructions mentioned about direct or indirect influences, which might have led the model into further thinking than needed for a straightforward question.

<2> 
For this example, again, it seems that the model has misinterpreted the question due to the complexity of the instructions in the prompt. The question asked if Jake shot his aunt intentionally. Nevertheless, considering the story context, Jake's rifle slipped when he was about to shoot, pointing to the unintentional aspect of his act that he did shoot but not purposefully. The model seems to have focused more on Jake's intent to have more money after his aunt’s death, rather than the action being questioned - did he intentionally shoot her or not.

In both instances, the model appears to be overly complicating what are, at their core, simple questions with straightforward answers. This is a clear indication that the prompt may be too intricate or ambiguous.

Improvements:

1. Simplicity: The instructions can be significantly simplified to avoid over-complication in interpretation.
2. Concentration on the question: The instructions can be tailored towards focusing on answering the question directly based on provided scenario or event.
3. Clear guidelines for complex scenarios: In the case of intricate events or multiple causes, the instructions should guide the model to dissect the event, focusing on the immediate scenario connected to the asked question.
4. Context interpretation: Encourage the model to understand the context of the question better to give the required straightforward answer instead of an overly complex analysis.
5. Precision: Stress on the precision of the given options while answering, aligning strictly with the context of the asked question.
6. Avoid broad perspective: In the cases where a question is asking about a single cause or effect, instruct the model not to delve into analyzing the situation from a broader perspective.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.
(3) Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes. Be mindful of both direct influences - events that directly lead to a result - and indirect influences, which set the stage for other events to occur. Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence.

cur_prompt: Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes. Pay attention to both the direct influences - actions that immediately lead to a result - and indirect influences, which pave the way for consequential actions. In your analysis, keep in mind that chronological order is not necessarily an indicator of cause and effect. Instead, each event should be evaluated for its actual impact on the final outcome, regardless of its order.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish did not directly cause Karen's death. The immediate cause of Karen's death was her severe allergic reaction to the wine sauce in the Moules Mariniere due to her hereditary disease. However, Mr. Carlson's decision to order that particular dish indirectly contributed to the outcome. If he had chosen the Scallops Meuniere instead, which did not contain wine, Karen may not have had the allergic reaction and subsequently died. Therefore, while Mr. Carlson's choice was not the immediate cause of Karen's death, it played a significant role in the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Model's response: Bob did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>
Correct label: B

Analysis: The model incorrectly attributes intentionality to Bob's actions. While Bob knew the actions he intended to take would harm the townspeople, his primary intention was to rob the bank. The harm to the townspeople was an incidental outcome of achieving this primary goal, not an independent, intended objective. The prompt does mention to consider intended actions versus incidental outcomes, but the complexity and length of the prompt might have overshadowed this crucial point for the model. 

<2>
Question: Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Model's response: In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish did not directly cause Karen's death. <answer>(B) No</answer>
Correct label: A

Analysis: Here the model misunderstood and gave the cause of death a moral shading instead of treating it as a sequence of cause and effect. The model's judgement was perhaps influenced by the fact that Mr. Carlson was unaware of Karen's hereditary disease. In a sequence of cause and effect evaluation, the act of selecting a dish with wine sauce directly resulted in Karen's allergic reaction and subsequent death. The model seems to have lost sight of the prompt's instruction to evaluate each event for its actual impact on the final outcome regardless of order or intention.

<3>
Question: Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Model's response: The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. <answer>(B) No</answer>
Correct label: A

Analysis: This example sees the model once again focusing on the primary intention of the character and overlooking consequential effects that were expected and accepted. The sniper fully anticipated the barrel heating up as a consequence of his actions when pulling the trigger. Despite the heating of the barrel being secondary and not his ultimate goal (which was to kill the commander), it was nonetheless a foreseeable and intended effect of his actions.

Improvements:

1. Simplify and clarify the difference between primary intentions and incidental outcomes that are expected, as both can fall under the umbrella of intention.

2. Specifically instruct the model not to attribute morality to causality judgments because this may lead to bias in examining cause-effect relationships.

3. Emphasize that direct and indirect influences should be considered in terms of their factual effects on the event sequence, not just their roles in the individuals' planning or primary objectives.

4. Consider breaking down the prompt into multiple sections or use bullet points to make sure important aspects stand out and are not overshadowed by the overall complexity.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes. Pay attention to both the direct influences - actions that immediately lead to a result - and indirect influences, which pave the way for consequential actions. In your analysis, keep in mind that chronological order is not necessarily an indicator of cause and effect. Instead, each event should be evaluated for its actual impact on the final outcome, regardless of its order. In scenarios where multiple events influence the outcome, hold a balanced approach to determine their necessity - whether the event must happen for the outcome and their sufficiency - can the event alone cause the outcome. Pay heed to intended actions versus incidental outcomes. Consider the conventional function of each event and possible omission, avoidance or deviation from norms, disregarding biases that may arise from event sequencing or presence of multiple causes. Understand that not all outcomes resulting from an event are purposefully intended. Highlight the difference between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. Take into account responsibility and potential intervention in the outcomes. In complex situations, aim to dissect interlaced causes, accurately assessing each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, while keeping clear of any tendency to make assumptions based on traditional sequencing or causality. Remember to equally evaluate impact of actions and non-actions on the final outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish did not directly cause Karen's death. The immediate cause of Karen's death was her severe allergic reaction to the wine sauce in the Moules Mariniere due to her hereditary disease. However, Mr. Carlson's decision to order that particular dish indirectly contributed to the outcome. If he had chosen the Scallops Meuniere instead, which did not contain wine, Karen may not have had the allergic reaction and subsequently died. Therefore, while Mr. Carlson's choice was not the immediate cause of Karen's death, it played a significant role in the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

4. Consider breaking down the prompt into multiple sections or use bullet points to make sure important aspects stand out and are not overshadowed by the overall complexity.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.
(3) Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes. Be mindful of both direct influences - events that directly lead to a result - and indirect influences, which set the stage for other events to occur. Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence. In cases where multiple events contribute to a single effect, maintain a disciplined approach in evaluating the necessity - does the event need to occur for the outcome to happen? - and sufficiency - is the event alone enough to cause the outcome? - of each cause. Pay particular attention to the intended and usual function of each event, disregarding bias that may result from their sequence or from the presence of more than one cause. Consider the possibility of overlooked actions, omissions, or deviations from expected patterns and their potential as cause factors. Always differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. In complex scenarios, strive to untangle multiple intertwined causes, focusing on each event's true contribution and relevance to the outcome and guarding against any presumption rising from the traditional order or connection of events in the given context.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog simply followed the new rule about pencil use and took a pencil when it was its turn, just like the bear did. The issue arose from the actions of both the bear and the hedgehog, not solely the hedgehog.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the question is about the intentional harm caused to the environment by the CEO. While the action was not directly targeted at the environment, the CEO was aware of the potential harm as described to him by the VP of R&D. Despite this knowledge, the CEO chose to proceed in favour of profits, displaying an indifference towards the environment. However, the language model incorrectly chose that the CEO did not intentionally harm the environment. 

- Reasons for Incorrect Answer: The model may have been confused by the term "intentionally". While the CEO's primary intent was the increase in profits and not directly harming the environment, his indifference to the side effect and decision to proceed does make him indirectly responsible for the harm caused. The prompt language may need further clarification around accountability in such nuanced scenarios, where direct and primary intentions differ but still lead to harmful consequences.

- Improvement: The prompt can be improved by adding more explicit guidance about understanding and interpreting the indirect intentions and actions that lead to harmful outcomes.

Wrong Example 2:

The question in this scenario is about the hedgehog's role in causing a problem for the polar bear - the unavailability of pencils. Although both the bear and the hedgehog equally contributed to the depletion of pencils, the question specifically focuses on the hedgehog's actions. The language model incorrectly chose the hedgehog did not cause the problem and attributed the problem equally to the hedgehog and bear. 

- Reasons for Incorrect Answer: The model might be misinterpreting the responsibility narrative in the prompt. In this scenario, the hedgehog, by choosing to take pencils, even though they were technically reserved for bears, shares responsibility for the problem. However, the model appears to have considered the equal taking of pencils by the bear and hedgehog and absolved the hedgehog.

- Improvement: The prompt can be enhanced by orienting the model to accurately evaluate actions despite any misdirection or side narratives, focusing on the question asked.

Summary of Improvements:

1. Implement cues to help the model better distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and the responsibility associated with these actions.

2. Train the model to understand and evaluate the impact of actions/non-actions more accurately, notwithstanding any side narratives or potentially distracting factors.

3. Add guidance on understanding the nuances of responsibility when multiple causes or contributors are present in the scenario, and focus primarily on the question asked.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
The CEO of a company is sitting in his office when his Vice President of R&D comes in and says, 'We are thinking of starting a new programme. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.' The CEO responds that he doesn't care about harming the environment and just wants to make as much profit as possible. The programme is carried out, profits are made and the environment is harmed. Did the CEO intentionally harm the environment?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog simply followed the new rule about pencil use and took a pencil when it was its turn, just like the bear did. The issue arose from the actions of both the bear and the hedgehog, not solely the hedgehog.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the question is about the intentional harm caused to the environment by the CEO. While the action was not directly targeted at the environment, the CEO was aware of the potential harm as described to him by the VP of R&D. Despite this knowledge, the CEO chose to proceed in favour of profits, displaying an indifference towards the environment. However, the language model incorrectly chose that the CEO did not intentionally harm the environment. 

- Reasons for Incorrect Answer: The model may have been confused by the term "intentionally". While the CEO's primary intent was the increase in profits and not directly harming the environment, his indifference to the side effect and decision to proceed does make him indirectly responsible for the harm caused. The prompt language may need further clarification around accountability in such nuanced scenarios, where direct and primary intentions differ but still lead to harmful consequences.

- Improvement: The prompt can be improved by adding more explicit guidance about understanding and interpreting the indirect intentions and actions that lead to harmful outcomes.

Wrong Example 2:

The question in this scenario is about the hedgehog's role in causing a problem for the polar bear - the unavailability of pencils. Although both the bear and the hedgehog equally contributed to the depletion of pencils, the question specifically focuses on the hedgehog's actions. The language model incorrectly chose the hedgehog did not cause the problem and attributed the problem equally to the hedgehog and bear. 

- Reasons for Incorrect Answer: The model might be misinterpreting the responsibility narrative in the prompt. In this scenario, the hedgehog, by choosing to take pencils, even though they were technically reserved for bears, shares responsibility for the problem. However, the model appears to have considered the equal taking of pencils by the bear and hedgehog and absolved the hedgehog.

- Improvement: The prompt can be enhanced by orienting the model to accurately evaluate actions despite any misdirection or side narratives, focusing on the question asked.

Summary of Improvements:

1. Implement cues to help the model better distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and the responsibility associated with these actions.

2. Train the model to understand and evaluate the impact of actions/non-actions more accurately, notwithstanding any side narratives or potentially distracting factors.

3. Add guidance on understanding the nuances of responsibility when multiple causes or contributors are present in the scenario, and focus primarily on the question asked.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Carefully examine the sequence of events and their resulting outcomes. Reflect critically on both direct and indirect influences when addressing the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given context. While keeping track of the chronological order, don't be biased by immediacy or sequence; instead, evaluate each event based on its true contribution and relevance to the outcome. Where multiple causes may contribute to a single effect, rigorously evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of each cause, guarding against any assumptions that might result from their sequence or the presence of more than one cause.
(3) Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes. Be mindful of both direct influences - events that directly lead to a result - and indirect influences, which set the stage for other events to occur. Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence. In cases where multiple events contribute to a single effect, maintain a disciplined approach in evaluating the necessity - does the event need to occur for the outcome to happen? - and sufficiency - is the event alone enough to cause the outcome? - of each cause. Pay particular attention to the intended and usual function of each event, disregarding bias that may result from their sequence or from the presence of more than one cause. Consider the possibility of overlooked actions, omissions, or deviations from expected patterns and their potential as cause factors. Always differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. In complex scenarios, strive to untangle multiple intertwined causes, focusing on each event's true contribution and relevance to the outcome and guarding against any presumption rising from the traditional order or connection of events in the given context.
(4) Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes. Pay attention to both the direct influences - actions that immediately lead to a result - and indirect influences, which pave the way for consequential actions. In your analysis, keep in mind that chronological order is not necessarily an indicator of cause and effect. Instead, each event should be evaluated for its actual impact on the final outcome, regardless of its order. In scenarios where multiple events influence the outcome, hold a balanced approach to determine their necessity - whether the event must happen for the outcome and their sufficiency - can the event alone cause the outcome. Pay heed to intended actions versus incidental outcomes. Consider the conventional function of each event and possible omission, avoidance or deviation from norms, disregarding biases that may arise from event sequencing or presence of multiple causes. Understand that not all outcomes resulting from an event are purposefully intended. Highlight the difference between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. Take into account responsibility and potential intervention in the outcomes. In complex situations, aim to dissect interlaced causes, accurately assessing each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, while keeping clear of any tendency to make assumptions based on traditional sequencing or causality. Remember to equally evaluate impact of actions and non-actions on the final outcome.

response:
<START> Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes, focusing on both direct and indirect influences that lead to the results. Remember, the chronological order of events does not necessarily show a cause-and-effect relationship. Each event should be scrutinized based on its actual impact on the final outcome, irrespective of the position it holds in the sequence. When outcomes are driven by multiple events, ensure a balanced judgment in determining the necessity of the event - is the event crucial for the outcome, and its sufficiency - can the event by itself trigger the outcome? Pay careful attention to actions that are intentional and those that have inadvertent outcomes. Understand the standard role of each event and any evasions, omissions, or deviations from standards, putting aside biases that may arise from the order of events or multiple causes. While not all outcomes are intentional, remember that knowledge of potential impacts can imply responsibility. Always differentiate between 'direct causes' and 'background causes' and consider who holds the responsibility and the potential for intervention in the outcomes. In layered situations, strive to tease apart intertwined causes, accurately gauging each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, avoiding any bias based on traditional sequence or causality. Always remember to equally appraise both actions and inactions and their impact on the final outcome. Focus on the direct question asked, considering the nuances of responsibility even when multiple causal factors are present. Explore the influence of direct and indirect intentions and the associated responsibility within actions and outcomes. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is not in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He changes its position, and he puts it in the lock position. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did the motorboat start because Ned changed the position of the motor?
Model's Answer: Yes (A)
Correct Answer: No (B)

Reason for incorrect answer:

1. Misinterpretation of Multiple Causes: The prompt instructs the AI to consider situations where multiple events influence the outcome and determine their necessity and sufficiency. In this instance, the model might have misunderstood the conditionality of the events, making the changing of the motor's position a necessary condition for the motorboat to start, while in fact the motorboat could have started if only the gear were in neutral.

2. Overemphasis on Last Event: Although the prompt asks the model to consider actions that don't immediately lead to a result, there might be a bias towards the most recent event (in this case, Ned changing the position of the motor), causing the model to incorrectly attribute the cause.

3. Disregard for Unnecessary Actions: The model is asked to evaluate the conventional function of each event and possible omission, avoidance or deviation from norms. It seems that it didn't recognize that Ned's action of changing the motor's position was not necessary for the motorboat to start.

To improve the prompt:

1. Specificity: Make clear that the model needs to evaluate each event individually and not give greater importance to more recent actions. 

2. Nuanced Understanding: Encourage the model to be more sensitive to conditionality and the concept of unnecessary conditions. When multiple factors can cause an outcome, the model should question the necessity of each.

3. Clarity: Ensure the instruction about necessary and sufficient conditions is explicit, i.e., whether the event must happen for the outcome or whether the event alone can cause the outcome.

4. Consideration of Non-Actions: Emphasize that the model should also consider the impact of non-actions (here, not putting the motor in the lock position wouldn't prevent the boat from starting).

response:
<START> Analyze the sequence of events and their respective outcomes with a balanced approach, focusing on both immediate and indirect influences. While it's crucial to note the chronological order, don't mistake it as an indicator of cause and effect. Each event should be viewed in its specific context and evaluated based on its concrete impact on the ultimate outcome, regardless of its place in the timeline. During instances wherein multiple events contribute to the outcome, systematically determine their necessity - whether they are indispensable for the effect to happen, and their sufficiency - whether they can alone result in the outcome. Additionally, compare actions that were intended towards a result to the unintentional, incidental outcomes. Pay heed to the function each event typically serves and any potential lapses, avoidances, or divergences from norms that may occur. Be aware that biases can occur due to the sequencing of these events or multiple causative factors. Realize that not every event's outcome is purposely intended and distinguish between 'immediate causes' and ‘underlying causes’. Consider any possibilities of intervention or ownership in the outcomes. In complicated matters, strive to untangle mixed causes, accurately evaluating each event’s participation and relevance to the result, without making assumptions based on conventional sequencing or causality. Remember to assess the influence of actions and non-actions on the final outcome; just because an action was taken doesn't necessarily mean it contributed to the outcome, and the non-performance of an action shouldn't automatically lead to the assumption that it didn't contribute to the result. In scenarios where multiple causes can lead to one effect, question whether each factor was indeed necessary, not merely a condition present at the time. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
John's job in the plastics division exposed him to asbestos, a known carcinogen, which ultimately led to his lung cancer. This exposure was a direct cause of his premature death. However, the accidental administration of the wrong medication by the new nurse also played a role in his death, as it triggered a severe allergic reaction and cardiac arrest. While John's job in the plastics division was a contributing factor to his premature death, the immediate cause of his death was the wrong medication administered by the nurse.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1> 
Question: Did John's job cause his premature death?

The model seems to consider the direct causes that led to John's actual death, but it also takes into account remote causes that contributed to his overall health condition. In the example given, the immediate cause of John's death was the wrong medication and not the job he did, even though his job led to his cancer condition. The prompt, as it stands, encourages an examination of all elements including the indirect causes such as the cancer. However, the question asks if the job (implying direct causality) was the cause of his premature death, to which, based on this specific situation, the answer should be "No".

Reasons for the model's mistake:
1. Construction of the prompt: The prompt encourages a comprehensive analysis of the events, their consequential outcomes and the psychological motivations. It pushes the model towards deliberation on both direct and indirect causations. As a result, the AI might consider indirect causal factors, such as the cancer caused by asbestos exposure at John's job, as viable inputs in determining his death. 

2. Interpretation of 'Cause': The model, guided by the prompt, might have conflated the immediate (direct) cause of death with the underlying (indirect) causes. Thus, it took into account the lung cancer due to asbestos exposure at John's job as a contributing factor to his death.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Highlight the need for discerning direct and immediate causes from indirect and remote causes in the situation. This will help the model focus on what directly resulted in the event in question.

2. The prompt can encourage the model to look specifically at what the question is asking for (immediate cause vs. underlying cause) to prevent it from conflating the two when forming an answer.

3. The prompt can also draw the model's attention to the context and nuances within the question for more accurate interpretations, resulting in an answer based on the specific circumstances described. It could instruct the model to isolate the main cause of the event (in this case, the death) from preceding conditions that are not the immediate cause. 

4. Encourage the model to distinguish between 'intentional and accidental' actions with more precision, aligning the output more with the actual question rather than relying on a broader interpretation.

5. Lastly, the prompt could emphasize discerning between elements that simply precede an event and those that directly cause it. It can include a guideline for the AI to consider the pathway of 'cause-effect' based on the immediacy of events.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>

Current Prompt Reasoning: The language model seems to have misinterpreted the causal relationship between the actions and events in the scenario. The model incorrectly identifies that setting the temperature to HIGH was the direct cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes. 

Misinterpretation: The question clearly establishes two conditions: the cycle set on MAX DRY or the temperature set on HIGH. Any of these settings would cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. In the given scenario, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY before David changes the temperature setting. Thus, even without changing the temperature, the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes.

<2>

Current Prompt Reasoning: The language model wrongly assigns the start of the motorboat to the gear being in neutral and disregards the other condition that could also have caused the motorboat to start.

Misinterpretation: The model seems to have an issue interpreting ‘or’ conditions, as it assumes that the condition that wasn't changed couldn't be the cause of the effect. Here, the motor being in the lock position is also a valid precondition for the motorboat to start.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Provide more guidance on dissecting complex conditions, especially when multiple actions, decisions, or events could potentially cause the result. 

2. Direct the model to pay extra attention when there are conditions related to 'and'/'or' in scenarios. 

3. Ask the model to focus on distinguishing between actions that are causative and actions that are merely incidental to the event, even if those actions were done intentionally.

4. Instruct the model to cross-check the conditions that were already met before the final action. 

5. Encourage the model to analyze the necessity of actions towards the resulting effect in the scenarios. An action is necessary if the outcome couldn't have happened without it.

7. The model should also be guided to interpret 'cause and effect' scenarios where multiple causes can lead to the same effect. Here it should be asked to consider other conditions as well in the analysis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind the characters' actions. Consider both deliberate and inadvertent causes when addressing questions about causal relationships. Acknowledge that a direct cause can result in unintended consequences and that multiple causes may contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions. Evaluate the actor's state of mind and motives at the time of the event, distinguishing between intentional actions and actions that accidentally cause certain outcomes. Do not equate causation with intentionality unless the evidence points to purposeful behavior. Be critical when analyzing scenarios and cautious before making assumptions in interpreting 'cause and effect' relations.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. The direct cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes was the change in the temperature setting, as indicated by the conditions set for the dryer to achieve that outcome. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The motorboat started because the gear was in neutral, not because Ned did not change the position of the motor. Therefore, the answer is (B) No. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>

Current Prompt Reasoning: The language model seems to have misinterpreted the causal relationship between the actions and events in the scenario. The model incorrectly identifies that setting the temperature to HIGH was the direct cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes. 

Misinterpretation: The question clearly establishes two conditions: the cycle set on MAX DRY or the temperature set on HIGH. Any of these settings would cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. In the given scenario, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY before David changes the temperature setting. Thus, even without changing the temperature, the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes.

<2>

Current Prompt Reasoning: The language model wrongly assigns the start of the motorboat to the gear being in neutral and disregards the other condition that could also have caused the motorboat to start.

Misinterpretation: The model seems to have an issue interpreting ‘or’ conditions, as it assumes that the condition that wasn't changed couldn't be the cause of the effect. Here, the motor being in the lock position is also a valid precondition for the motorboat to start.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Provide more guidance on dissecting complex conditions, especially when multiple actions, decisions, or events could potentially cause the result. 

2. Direct the model to pay extra attention when there are conditions related to 'and'/'or' in scenarios. 

3. Ask the model to focus on distinguishing between actions that are causative and actions that are merely incidental to the event, even if those actions were done intentionally.

4. Instruct the model to cross-check the conditions that were already met before the final action. 

5. Encourage the model to analyze the necessity of actions towards the resulting effect in the scenarios. An action is necessary if the outcome couldn't have happened without it.  

6. The prompt should also direct the model not to associate a cause solely with the last action if other conditions were already fulfilled. 

7. The model should also be guided to interpret 'cause and effect' scenarios where multiple causes can lead to the same effect. Here it should be asked to consider other conditions as well in the analysis. 

In summary, the model needs to improve its interpretation of 'or' conditions and should not be swayed by a bias towards the last action performed. Instead, it should consider all factors that could have led to the result. The prompt should enforce these aspects, clearly guiding the model to take into account any pre-set conditions, not equating causation with the final action unless the analysis has thoroughly looked at all aspects.

Remember that an action, even if carried out deliberately, can sometimes be incidental to the outcome, particularly when other preconditions were already in place. Be aware that direct causation can lead to unintended consequences and that more than one cause can contribute to a singular effect. Carefully differentiate between intentional actions and actions that incidentally create certain outcomes. Don’t automatically associate the final action with causation, particularly if previous conditions were already met. Unless proof indicates that the action was purposefully done to generate the consequence, do not equate intentionality with causation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the direct cause of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address was the simultaneous login of Alice and Zoe, which violated the company's policy. Alice's action of logging in when Zoe was already logged in contributed to the triggering of the email being sent. However, it was the combination of both Alice and Zoe being logged in at the same time that led to the unintended consequence of the empty email being sent.

Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The error in this example arises from a misinterpretation of how responsibility is shared between Alice and Zoe when the company policy is violated. The prompt emphasizes heavily on causation, which can make the model to oversimplify the situation by equating the action of Alice with the consequence. In fact, the violation of the company policy happened when Zoe logged in during the morning, not Alice.

Reasons for error:
1. The prompt's focus on direct causes and consequences may lead the model to place too much responsibility on the latest action (in this case, Alice's login) rather than evaluating the context in which the consequential event occurred. The causation is more multifaceted being a conjunction of actions by Zoe and Alice.

2. The model did not take into consideration that Alice followed the company's policy, whereas Zoe's action was one that violated it. This influence of behavior (following or violating rules) is not addressed in the prompt, and it may be important for determining causation in this particular example.

3. The current prompt suggests equating causation with intentionality if there is evidence of purposeful behavior. The model may have interpreted Alice logging on to the system while aware of the policy as purposeful, which indeed is not the case in this scenario.

Improvements:
1. Modify the prompt to add instructions for considering violations of known rules or regulations when determining causation.

2. Add instructions to differentiate between the latest action taken and its real influence on the outcome, rather than directly linking the final action with the consequential event. 

3. Clarify the distinction between 'intentional' and 'purposeful' behaviors within the context of known rules or policies.

4. Include instructions to consider overlapping or simultaneous causes rather than attributing an effect to a single direct cause. This could avert the model from focusing solely on the final action while determining causation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the direct cause of Karen's death was her severe allergic reaction to the wine sauce in the Moules Mariniere due to her rare hereditary disease. Mr. Carlson's choice of dish, while unknowingly contributing to the allergic reaction, was not the ultimate cause of Karen's death. The underlying cause was Karen's genetic condition and the specific proteins in the wine sauce that triggered the reaction. Therefore, the answer is:

The model's input is:
Conduct a detailed examination of events in the chronological order that they occur, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind individual actions. Pay particular attention to the context, including any governing rules or policies. Do not simplify causal relationships, instead acknowledge both deliberate and inadvertent causes, be they direct or indirect contributions. Understand that a single effect may be a result of multiple causes, sometimes overlapping or intersecting, and a single cause might result in various unintended consequences. Always consider the actors' state of mind and motives at the time of the event, differentiating between actions that were purposefully performed and actions which resulted in accidental outcomes. Recognize that causation does not necessarily align with intentionality unless a clear evidence of purposeful behavior is present. Exercise critical analysis and prudence before making attributions or making assumptions about 'cause and effect'. Understand that the latest action may not always be the most direct cause of the consequential event while on the contrary, earlier actions or violations of established rules, despite the chronology, can be the most impactful on the outcome.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the outcome of Louie winning the $100 bet was not solely due to him making the layup at the end of the game. The bet was contingent on Louie making either a layup or a 3-point shot, and he had already made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game. Therefore, the $100 win was a result of Louie making both a 3-point shot and a layup during the game.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

gradient:
In the first example, the language model labelled the answer as B (No), suggesting that Mr. Carlson's choice of dish did not cause Karen's death. The error here seems to have resulted from a nuanced interpretation of the causality relationship. While it is accurate that the direct cause of Karen's death was her severe allergic reaction due to her rare condition, the prompt explicitly asked for evaluation of causality with careful consideration of both direct and indirect contributions. Given the detail in the prompt to pay attention to complete contextual evaluation as well as the chronology of the actions, it is clear that the dish chosen by Mr. Carlson did in fact contribute causally to Karen's lethal allergic reaction, even though this was unintentional. Therefore, the answer should have been (A) Yes.

In the second example, the language model has incorrectly analyzed the requirements of the question and isolated the final event (the layup) as the cause of Louie winning the $100, while in truth, Louie had already met the conditions to win with his 3-point shot at the start of the game. This misinterpretation could be attributed to the language model's possible overemphasis on the chronological order or the impact of more recent actions.

Based on these reasons, improvements to the prompt might include:

1. Clarifying what is meant by direct and indirect causality and emphasizing the importance of evaluating the entire context of a situation, rather than focusing too heavily on certain aspects or treating the chronology as a determinant.
2. Add more emphasis on the interpretation of sequence. More recent actions do not necessarily imply more direct causality.
3. Further emphasize the necessity of distinguishing accidental and intentional outcomes, and understanding the individuals' knowledge and intentions when assessing causality.
4. Giving more detailed explanations or examples on 'cause and effect' and explaining the necessity of applying critical thinking in identifying the most impactful cause in any given scenario.
5. Placing further importance on the significance of understanding and acknowledging the conditions established, such as rules or agreements in scenarios and how they should be evaluated in causality analysis.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?

(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind the characters' actions. Consider both deliberate and inadvertent causes when addressing questions about causal relationships. Acknowledge that a direct cause can result in unintended consequences and that multiple causes may contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions. Evaluate the actor's state of mind and motives at the time of the event, distinguishing between intentional actions and actions that accidentally cause certain outcomes. Do not equate causation with intentionality unless the evidence points to purposeful behavior. Be critical when analyzing scenarios and cautious before making assumptions in interpreting 'cause and effect' relations.

Consider the broader context of the situation, and factor in any rules, policies, or agreements that exist. Address the complexities of causality by acknowledging both intentional and unintentional causes, whether they directly or indirectly contribute to the outcome. Be aware that a single cause can have multiple effects, some unintended, and a single effect may be the result of multiple intersecting or concurrent causes. Assess the state of mind and intentions of the actors at the time of the event, making a clear distinction between deliberate acts and accidental consequences. Understand that causation does not automatically imply intention, and direct evidence of premeditated action must be present to consider it as such. Exercise a high degree of critical evaluation, epistemic caution and sound judgement in inferring 'cause and effect' relationships. Remember that the latest action or the chronological last may not be the most influential cause for the eventual outcome. Earlier actions, violations of set rules, or the fulfillment of certain conditions, regardless of when they occur, can be pivotal in shaping the ending scenario. Assess all relevant factors thoroughly and holistically, and never isolate events from their context when attributing causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's action of spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game clearly state that Alex will win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green as expected, he won the game based on the predetermined conditions of the game. Therefore, the spinning of the spinner was not the direct cause of Alex winning the game.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils out of the box before the polar bear arrived. The hedgehog's actions were not intentional as it was unaware of the new rule about pencil use. The bear, on the other hand, knowingly took pencils despite the rule. Therefore, the bear's actions were the primary cause of the polar bear not being able to finish his homework.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Question 1:

The question seeks to determine causality based on conditions that allowed Alex to win the game. The correct answer is A because according to the presented rules, Alex wins if he rolls a total higher than 2 or the spinner lands on green.

However, the language model selected option B, indicating the rules of the game caused Alex's win and not his spinning of the spinner. This seems to stem from the prompt's emphasis on multiple and nuanced causes, which could have led the language model to explore broader conditions of game rules than directly focusing on the immediate causes (i.e., rolling the dice and spinning the spinner).

The prompt might also have led the language model to focus too heavily on the states of mind and motives (which here, as it is a game based on chance, are of less importance). It — presumably — then assumed that since Alex's intention to win the game didn't directly correlate with his spinning the spinner, it wasn't a substantial cause for his win.

2. Question 2:

This question also involves a causal relationship. The correct answer is A because the hedgehog, despite ignorance of the rule, still participated in the depleting of the pencils, thereby indirectly contributing to the polar bear’s problem.

The language model, however, chose option B, reasoning that the hedgehog's action — due to ignorance of the rules — could not carry as much causality. Since the hedgehog's actions weren't 'purposeful,' this might have led the model to perceive it as less or not causative.

This misconception could have been prompted by its guidance not to acknowledge causation if “clear evidence of purposeful behavior'' isn't present. This may also stem from the prompt’s emphasis on distinguishing "purposefully performed" actions from those causing "accidental outcomes".

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

1. The prompt could be improved by placing more importance on direct and evident causes of events, irrespective of actors' knowledge or intent.
2. The model should be guided to identify causality from the immediate actions leading to an observed effect, regardless of rules or policies, especially when the rules are not explicit in exempting inadvertent actions.
3. The prompt should highlight that accidental or unintended actions can still cause significant outcomes.
4. Prompts should acknowledge that an actor's state of mind or intent is not always necessary for their actions to have causal effects.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils out of the box before the polar bear arrived. The hedgehog's actions were not intentional as it was unaware of the new rule about pencil use. The bear, on the other hand, knowingly took pencils despite the rule. Therefore, the bear's actions were the primary cause of the polar bear not being able to finish his homework.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1. Question 1:

The question seeks to determine causality based on conditions that allowed Alex to win the game. The correct answer is A because according to the presented rules, Alex wins if he rolls a total higher than 2 or the spinner lands on green.

However, the language model selected option B, indicating the rules of the game caused Alex's win and not his spinning of the spinner. This seems to stem from the prompt's emphasis on multiple and nuanced causes, which could have led the language model to explore broader conditions of game rules than directly focusing on the immediate causes (i.e., rolling the dice and spinning the spinner).

The prompt might also have led the language model to focus too heavily on the states of mind and motives (which here, as it is a game based on chance, are of less importance). It — presumably — then assumed that since Alex's intention to win the game didn't directly correlate with his spinning the spinner, it wasn't a substantial cause for his win.

2. Question 2:

This question also involves a causal relationship. The correct answer is A because the hedgehog, despite ignorance of the rule, still participated in the depleting of the pencils, thereby indirectly contributing to the polar bear’s problem.

The language model, however, chose option B, reasoning that the hedgehog's action — due to ignorance of the rules — could not carry as much causality. Since the hedgehog's actions weren't 'purposeful,' this might have led the model to perceive it as less or not causative.

This misconception could have been prompted by its guidance not to acknowledge causation if “clear evidence of purposeful behavior'' isn't present. This may also stem from the prompt’s emphasis on distinguishing "purposefully performed" actions from those causing "accidental outcomes".

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

1. The prompt could be improved by placing more importance on direct and evident causes of events, irrespective of actors' knowledge or intent.
2. The model should be guided to identify causality from the immediate actions leading to an observed effect, regardless of rules or policies, especially when the rules are not explicit in exempting inadvertent actions.
3. The prompt should highlight that accidental or unintended actions can still cause significant outcomes.
4. Prompts should acknowledge that an actor's state of mind or intent is not always necessary for their actions to have causal effects.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind the characters' actions. Consider both deliberate and inadvertent causes when addressing questions about causal relationships. Acknowledge that a direct cause can result in unintended consequences and that multiple causes may contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions. Evaluate the actor's state of mind and motives at the time of the event, distinguishing between intentional actions and actions that accidentally cause certain outcomes. Do not equate causation with intentionality unless the evidence points to purposeful behavior. Be critical when analyzing scenarios and cautious before making assumptions in interpreting 'cause and effect' relations.
(3) Conduct a detailed examination of events in the chronological order that they occur, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind individual actions. Pay particular attention to the context, including any governing rules or policies. Do not simplify causal relationships, instead acknowledge both deliberate and inadvertent causes, be they direct or indirect contributions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?

The receptionist has repeatedly emailed them reminders that only administrative assistants are allowed to take the pens. On Monday morning, one of the administrative assistants encounters Professor Smith walking past the receptionist's desk. Both take pens. Later that day, the receptionist needs to take an important message... but she has a problem. There are no pens left on her desk. Did the administrative assistant cause the problem?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Model's Answer: (B) No
Correct Answer: (A) Yes

An incorrect understanding of the problem seems to have led the model astray. The question specifically asked whether Billy caused the motion detector to go off. Here, the assumption is that the alarm would go off if at least one person appeared in the room, and as such, both Billy and Suzy, individually, would have caused the alarm to go off. The model falsely interpreted the trigger event as a combined presence of Billy and Suzy, leading to a wrong answer.

Possible improvements based on this error:

1. The prompt could clarify its request for the model to consider some "causes" as independently sufficient to bring about an "effect" even if other causes are also independently sufficient.
  
2. The prompt could ask the model to pay attention to the logical conditions given in the problems, such as "at least one person" in this case.

<2>
Question: Did the administrative assistant cause the problem?
Model's Answer: (A) Yes
Correct Answer: (B) No

The model got this incorrect because it attributed the result (the pens being gone) to the apparent action of the administrative assistant taking a pen, even though this was a permitted action. The faculty member, who was not allowed to take the pens, was the actual cause of the situation - the lack of pens. The model seems to have distributed culpability based on an action (taking a pen) rather than considering the rule that was violated.

Possible improvements based on this error:

1. The prompt could more explicitly ask the model to consider the established rules and their violation in causation factors and not just the actions directly leading to the event.

2. The prompt could instruct the model to focus more closely on the role of intentionality in causal relationships, as well as the norms and rules governing the situation.

Based on these reasons:

1. It would be helpful if the prompt more explicitly referred to the logical conditions at play, asking the model to consider single, independent causes as capable of producing an effect.

2. The prompt could push the model harder to consider the rules of the situation and not just the actions.

3. The prompt could ask the model to more thoroughly consider the intentionality behind actions, especially in situations where rules or norms are present.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
The sniper intentionally shot and killed the enemy commander, but he did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The heating of the barrel was an unintended consequence of his intentional action of pulling the trigger.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Kylie and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. However, Drew doesn't usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, unexpectedly, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, and Oliver also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The question involves intentional action causing an unintentional side effect. The sniper intentionally pulls the trigger knowing it will heat up the gun barrel, but he doesn't care about that effect. Although the prompt instructs the model to consider both intentional and unintentional causes and effects, it seemingly leads the model to differentiate too much between deliberate and inadvertent actions. The prompt might be leading the model to focus more on the actor's indifference towards the side effect rather than the clear cause-effect relationship that the sniper knew pulling the trigger would heat up the barrel. So, while it is true the heating of the barrel was incidental to the sniper’s primary intent (killing the enemy commander), he nonetheless knowingly brought about this outcome by triggering the gun.

Example 2:
The question requires a comprehensive understanding that causality does not equal to participation. In this case, all Drew, Kylie, and Oliver contributed to the end result since each of their actions of purchasing coffee collectively caused the profit. However, it's also true that either Kylie's or Oliver's action alone is sufficient to cause the profit. That is, if Drew had not ordered coffee, the coffee shop still would have made a profit due to Kylie and Oliver. The prompt could be leading model to oversimplify the concept of 'cause and effect' by overlooking the prompt's counsel to understand that "earlier actions, even when inadvertent or unknowing of rules, could have significant impact on the final outcome", fail to recognize that cause and effect isn’t a straightforward, one-to-one relationship. It seems to rely too much on the sequence of the events and the direct participation, rather than considering the actual causation.

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Better emphasize that an individual knowing a certain outcome will occur as a side effect of their actions, regardless of whether they care about that outcome, can still be seen as intentional causation of that outcome.
2. Further clarify that an individual’s action contributing to an outcome doesn't necessarily mean their action caused the outcome, especially when the outcome would have occurred regardless of their action.
3. Give more guidance on assessing overlapping causes and their effects. The prompt could emphasize that a cause must be necessary for its effect; if the effect could have happened regardless of the cause, then that cause may not necessarily be "a cause" of the outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind the characters' actions. Consider both deliberate and inadvertent causes when addressing questions about causal relationships. Acknowledge that a direct cause can result in unintended consequences and that multiple causes may contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions. Evaluate the actor's state of mind and motives at the time of the event, distinguishing between intentional actions and actions that accidentally cause certain outcomes. Do not equate causation with intentionality unless the evidence points to purposeful behavior. Be critical when analyzing scenarios and cautious before making assumptions in interpreting 'cause and effect' relations.
(3) Conduct a detailed examination of events in the chronological order that they occur, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind individual actions. Pay particular attention to the context, including any governing rules or policies. Do not simplify causal relationships, instead acknowledge both deliberate and inadvertent causes, be they direct or indirect contributions. Understand that a single effect may be a result of multiple causes, sometimes overlapping or intersecting, and a single cause might result in various unintended consequences. Always consider the actors' state of mind and motives at the time of the event, differentiating between actions that were purposefully performed and actions which resulted in accidental outcomes. Recognize that causation does not necessarily align with intentionality unless a clear evidence of purposeful behavior is present. Exercise critical analysis and prudence before making attributions or making assumptions about 'cause and effect'. Understand that the latest action may not always be the most direct cause of the consequential event while on the contrary, earlier actions or violations of established rules, despite the chronology, can be the most impactful on the outcome.
(4) Analyze the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the actions taken by individuals. Emphasize on the immediate and direct causes of these outcomes, taking into account both deliberate and unintended actions, regardless of their intention or knowledge of rules. Understand that cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors, sometimes overlapping or intersecting. Acknowledge that a single cause might have various effects, including inadvertent ones. When considering causality, do not overly rely on the actor's state of mind and motives; note that unintended actions can still have substantial outcomes. Causation does not always align with intentionality. Exercise prudence in making attributions about 'cause and effect' and remember: even if an actor’s intentions were not evident or an action appears accidental, it can still be causative. Remain aware that earlier actions, even when inadvertent or unknowing of rules, could have significant impact on the final outcome, regardless of chronological sequence of events.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Examine the sequence of events in chronological order, their resulting outcomes, and the intentional and unintentional actions of individuals. Emphasize on both the direct causes of these outcomes, as well as the indirect ones, considering the different factors that potentially intersect and overlap, giving rise to multiple potential effects, intended or otherwise. It is crucial to remember that an intentional action may result in unintentional side effects that the actor knew would happen but was indifferent towards; this is still a form of intentional causation. While evaluating causality, be careful not to overly consider the actors' intents and motivations; unintentional actions can have substantial effects. Causation does not always correlate with intentionality. When an individual's action contributes to an outcome, discern whether their action was a necessary cause or merely coincidental, as an outcome that would have occurred regardless of their contribution does not constitute causation by them. Understand that causality entails not only participation but also the necessity of an action for an outcome. Apply prudence in making attributions about 'cause and effect,' keeping in mind that intentionality is not always evident. An action, regardless of how accidental it appears or how indifferent the actor was to its rules or consequences, can still have causative properties. Lastly, keep in mind that preceding actions, whether intentional or unknowing of rules, could profoundly influence the final outcome, regardless of chronological sequences. The goal is to discern the underlying causal relationships in a nuanced, multi-faceted manner. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
Alex won the game because of the combination of both the coin flip and rolling a 12. If either the coin had come up tails or he had rolled less than 12, he would not have won. Therefore, the answer is:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Janet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?

(A) Yes
(B) No

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did Alex win because of the coin flip?

The model answered 'Yes' to this question primarily because the prompt directed the model to consider the "immediate and direct causes" of an outcome and to acknowledge when an action, regardless of intention or knowledge, contributes to an effect. The model took both conditions, the dice roll and the coin flip, as causative factors for Alex's win since both conditions had to be met.

However, the question was not asking about both conditions. It specifically pointed to the coin flip, which was the incorrect answer since Alex's winning is primarily caused by the dice roll that has less probability compared to coin flip. The prompt failed to guide the model to emphasize more on the significant factor when considering a combination of multiple factors.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?

The model answered 'No' to this question primarily because the prompt instructed it to "understand that cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors, sometimes overlapping or intersecting," and it could be drawn to prioritize Janet’s omitted action as the main cause, overlooking Kate’s inaction.

However, the question is about the action, or rather the inaction, of Kate and whether her decision against filling the oil resulted in the machine breakdown. Although it wasn't her responsibility, she knew the risks involved. The prompt seemed to inadvertently lead the model to over-focus on the 'actor's state of mind' or 'responsibility' i.e., in the responsibility lies with Janet, not Kate.

To improve the language prompt for the task and prevent these errors:

1. Prompt clarification: Clarify that the model should prioritize evaluating the 'cause' in focus i.e., if a question asks about a particular cause, the model should prioritize it over a combination of causes.
   
2. Address mitigating factors: Instruct the model to assess the gravity, probability, and effect of the action or inaction under question in comparison to other factors.
   
3. Responsibility vs. Causality: Distinguish that the model should consider the causality directly associated with an action. The actor’s responsibility or lack thereof should not deviate from the cause and effect analysis.
   
4. Clear instructions: Make it clear that unintentional or non-intrusive factors can potentially have significant outcomes. Ignoring or failing to carry out an action can be just as critical as performing an action.  

The revised prompt could be:

Analyze events, outcomes, and actions. Primarily focus on the immediate causes of these outcomes, involving both deliberate and unintentional actions. Pay careful attention to the impact, chances, and importance of an action or inaction, comparing it to other factors when examining questions focused on a specific cause. Consider the causality directly associated with an action more than the responsibility associated with the actor. Remember that ignoring or failing to carry out pivotal actions can be just as causative. Always consider the causality in focus when queried about a particular cause. Keep in mind that a causal chain can result from multiple factors, but prioritize evaluating the 'cause' in question.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the actions taken by individuals. Emphasize on the immediate and direct causes of these outcomes, taking into account both deliberate and unintended actions, regardless of their intention or knowledge of rules. Understand that cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors, sometimes overlapping or intersecting. Acknowledge that a single cause might have various effects, including inadvertent ones. When considering causality, do not overly rely on the actor's state of mind and motives; note that unintended actions can still have substantial outcomes. Causation does not always align with intentionality. Exercise prudence in making attributions about 'cause and effect' and remember: even if an actor’s intentions were not evident or an action appears accidental, it can still be causative. Remain aware that earlier actions, even when inadvertent or unknowing of rules, could have significant impact on the final outcome, regardless of chronological sequence of events.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Alex won the game because of the combination of both the coin flip and rolling a 12. If either the coin had come up tails or he had rolled less than 12, he would not have won. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Janet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Kate not putting oil in the machine did not cause it to break down. The immediate and direct cause of the machine breaking down was Janet forgetting to put oil in it. Kate's decision not to put oil in the machine, while a contributing factor, was not the primary cause of the breakdown.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did Alex win because of the coin flip?

The model answered 'Yes' to this question primarily because the prompt directed the model to consider the "immediate and direct causes" of an outcome and to acknowledge when an action, regardless of intention or knowledge, contributes to an effect. The model took both conditions, the dice roll and the coin flip, as causative factors for Alex's win since both conditions had to be met.

However, the question was not asking about both conditions. It specifically pointed to the coin flip, which was the incorrect answer since Alex's winning is primarily caused by the dice roll that has less probability compared to coin flip. The prompt failed to guide the model to emphasize more on the significant factor when considering a combination of multiple factors.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?

The model answered 'No' to this question primarily because the prompt instructed it to "understand that cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors, sometimes overlapping or intersecting," and it could be drawn to prioritize Janet’s omitted action as the main cause, overlooking Kate’s inaction.

However, the question is about the action, or rather the inaction, of Kate and whether her decision against filling the oil resulted in the machine breakdown. Although it wasn't her responsibility, she knew the risks involved. The prompt seemed to inadvertently lead the model to over-focus on the 'actor's state of mind' or 'responsibility' i.e., in the responsibility lies with Janet, not Kate.

To improve the language prompt for the task and prevent these errors:

1. Prompt clarification: Clarify that the model should prioritize evaluating the 'cause' in focus i.e., if a question asks about a particular cause, the model should prioritize it over a combination of causes.
   
2. Address mitigating factors: Instruct the model to assess the gravity, probability, and effect of the action or inaction under question in comparison to other factors.
   
3. Responsibility vs. Causality: Distinguish that the model should consider the causality directly associated with an action. The actor’s responsibility or lack thereof should not deviate from the cause and effect analysis.
   
4. Clear instructions: Make it clear that unintentional or non-intrusive factors can potentially have significant outcomes. Ignoring or failing to carry out an action can be just as critical as performing an action.  

The revised prompt could be:

Analyze events, outcomes, and actions. Primarily focus on the immediate causes of these outcomes, involving both deliberate and unintentional actions. Pay careful attention to the impact, chances, and importance of an action or inaction, comparing it to other factors when examining questions focused on a specific cause. Consider the causality directly associated with an action more than the responsibility associated with the actor. Remember that ignoring or failing to carry out pivotal actions can be just as causative. Always consider the causality in focus when queried about a particular cause. Keep in mind that a causal chain can result from multiple factors, but prioritize evaluating the 'cause' in question.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind the characters' actions. Consider both deliberate and inadvertent causes when addressing questions about causal relationships. Acknowledge that a direct cause can result in unintended consequences and that multiple causes may contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions. Evaluate the actor's state of mind and motives at the time of the event, distinguishing between intentional actions and actions that accidentally cause certain outcomes. Do not equate causation with intentionality unless the evidence points to purposeful behavior. Be critical when analyzing scenarios and cautious before making assumptions in interpreting 'cause and effect' relations.
(3) Conduct a detailed examination of events in the chronological order that they occur, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind individual actions. Pay particular attention to the context, including any governing rules or policies. Do not simplify causal relationships, instead acknowledge both deliberate and inadvertent causes, be they direct or indirect contributions. Understand that a single effect may be a result of multiple causes, sometimes overlapping or intersecting, and a single cause might result in various unintended consequences. Always consider the actors' state of mind and motives at the time of the event, differentiating between actions that were purposefully performed and actions which resulted in accidental outcomes. Recognize that causation does not necessarily align with intentionality unless a clear evidence of purposeful behavior is present. Exercise critical analysis and prudence before making attributions or making assumptions about 'cause and effect'. Understand that the latest action may not always be the most direct cause of the consequential event while on the contrary, earlier actions or violations of established rules, despite the chronology, can be the most impactful on the outcome.
(4) Analyze the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the actions taken by individuals. Emphasize on the immediate and direct causes of these outcomes, taking into account both deliberate and unintended actions, regardless of their intention or knowledge of rules. Understand that cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors, sometimes overlapping or intersecting. Acknowledge that a single cause might have various effects, including inadvertent ones. When considering causality, do not overly rely on the actor's state of mind and motives; note that unintended actions can still have substantial outcomes. Causation does not always align with intentionality. Exercise prudence in making attributions about 'cause and effect' and remember: even if an actor’s intentions were not evident or an action appears accidental, it can still be causative. Remain aware that earlier actions, even when inadvertent or unknowing of rules, could have significant impact on the final outcome, regardless of chronological sequence of events.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Assess the sequence of events, direct consequences, and individual actions. Prioritize the immediate causes behind these events, considering both intentional and unintentional actions irrespective of their conscious intent or awareness of rules. When analysing questions targeting a specific cause, evaluate the cause under focus rather considering a combination of causes. Be mindful that causes and their effects can emanate from multiple overlapping or intersecting factors. Accept that one cause can ignite diverse effects, including unexpected ones. Don't solely rely on the actor's intent or motives when assessing causality; acknowledge the fact that unintentional actions can induce significant effects. Causation is not always parallel to intentionality. In your judgment of 'cause and effect', exercise caution and understand that an action may still be causative, even if its actor’s intent was unclear or if the action seemed accidental. Keep in mind that earlier actions, whether willful or ignorant of rules, may significantly shape the final outcome, without being strictly tied to the chronological sequence of events. Always remember, regardless of the individual's role or responsibility, their actions or non-interventions may hold pivotal implications in the context of cause and effect. <END>

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that when the bullet travels through the air it will definitely disturb the air molecules around it. But the sniper doesn't care at all about disturbing air molecules, he just wants to shoot his target. So, he pulls the trigger. As the sniper expected, as the bullet travels from his gun into the enemy commander, it disturbed some air molecules. Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the immediate and direct cause of the work emails containing important customer information being deleted from the central computer was the fact that both Billy and Suzy were logged into the central computer at the same time. This action was a violation of the company's policy, which stated that only one person should be logged in at a time to prevent such issues from occurring. Therefore, the cause of the deletion of the work emails was the simultaneous login of both Billy and Suzy, rather than any specific action taken by Suzy.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, Joe caused his son's injury. His decision to stop and help the injured person led to a chain of events that ultimately resulted in his son getting hurt.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example 1:
The model wrongly answers yes, suggesting the sniper intentionally disturbed air molecules. The prompt emphasizes the need to carefully look at both deliberate and unintended actions, deliberate being defined as carried out consciously and intentionally. The model, however, fails at discerning between actions that are a byproduct of an intentional action and actions that are intentional themselves. The sniper intended to shoot the enemy commander, disturbing the air molecules was an unavoidable result of this action but not his primary or secondary intention.

For example 2:
The model wrongly answers no, rejecting that Suzy caused the central computer to delete work emails. The guideline in the prompt specifies that "cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors." In this case, both Suzy and Billy's simultaneous action caused the system to delete the emails. The model failed to recognize that causation may involve multiple actors.

For example 3:
The model answers yes, attributing causality of the child’s injury to Joe. The prompt reinforces the need to be cautious about attributing cause and effect. Despite Joe's delay indirectly leading to the situation, Joe cannot be held as the direct cause of the injury. Elements out of Joe's control (the drunk driver hitting the car) were the immediate cause of the accident and his son’s injury.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify the difference between intentional actions and unintentional consequences of those actions.
2. Highlight that causality can involve multiple actors and their collective actions that lead to a result.
3. Reinforce that while understanding cause and effect is important, the direct and immediate cause should hold more weight in determining causation.
4. Provide examples to guide the model's understanding of cause and effect. The model needs concrete examples in order to construct accurate schemas for complex concepts, balancing rule-based reasoning and intuitive thinking about causation.

But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, Joe caused his son's injury. His decision to stop and help the injured person led to a chain of events that ultimately resulted in his son getting hurt. Although Joe's intention was to help someone in need, the unintended consequence of his actions was the injury to his son. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For example 1:
The model wrongly answers yes, suggesting the sniper intentionally disturbed air molecules. The prompt emphasizes the need to carefully look at both deliberate and unintended actions, deliberate being defined as carried out consciously and intentionally. The model, however, fails at discerning between actions that are a byproduct of an intentional action and actions that are intentional themselves. The sniper intended to shoot the enemy commander, disturbing the air molecules was an unavoidable result of this action but not his primary or secondary intention.

For example 2:
The model wrongly answers no, rejecting that Suzy caused the central computer to delete work emails. The guideline in the prompt specifies that "cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors." In this case, both Suzy and Billy's simultaneous action caused the system to delete the emails. The model failed to recognize that causation may involve multiple actors.

For example 3:
The model answers yes, attributing causality of the child’s injury to Joe. The prompt reinforces the need to be cautious about attributing cause and effect. Despite Joe's delay indirectly leading to the situation, Joe cannot be held as the direct cause of the injury. Elements out of Joe's control (the drunk driver hitting the car) were the immediate cause of the accident and his son’s injury.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify the difference between intentional actions and unintentional consequences of those actions.
2. Highlight that causality can involve multiple actors and their collective actions that lead to a result.
3. Reinforce that while understanding cause and effect is important, the direct and immediate cause should hold more weight in determining causation.
4. Provide examples to guide the model's understanding of cause and effect. The model needs concrete examples in order to construct accurate schemas for complex concepts, balancing rule-based reasoning and intuitive thinking about causation.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the sequence of events and the consequential outcomes. Consider both direct and indirect contributions when answering the questions about cause and effect relations in the scenario. Pay attention to the chronological order and acknowledge multiple causes if they contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions.
(2) Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind the characters' actions. Consider both deliberate and inadvertent causes when addressing questions about causal relationships. Acknowledge that a direct cause can result in unintended consequences and that multiple causes may contribute to a single effect in the causal attribution questions. Evaluate the actor's state of mind and motives at the time of the event, distinguishing between intentional actions and actions that accidentally cause certain outcomes. Do not equate causation with intentionality unless the evidence points to purposeful behavior. Be critical when analyzing scenarios and cautious before making assumptions in interpreting 'cause and effect' relations.
(3) Conduct a detailed examination of events in the chronological order that they occur, their consequential outcomes, and the psychological motivations behind individual actions. Pay particular attention to the context, including any governing rules or policies. Do not simplify causal relationships, instead acknowledge both deliberate and inadvertent causes, be they direct or indirect contributions. Understand that a single effect may be a result of multiple causes, sometimes overlapping or intersecting, and a single cause might result in various unintended consequences. Always consider the actors' state of mind and motives at the time of the event, differentiating between actions that were purposefully performed and actions which resulted in accidental outcomes. Recognize that causation does not necessarily align with intentionality unless a clear evidence of purposeful behavior is present. Exercise critical analysis and prudence before making attributions or making assumptions about 'cause and effect'. Understand that the latest action may not always be the most direct cause of the consequential event while on the contrary, earlier actions or violations of established rules, despite the chronology, can be the most impactful on the outcome.
(4) Analyze the events in chronological order, their consequential outcomes, and the actions taken by individuals. Emphasize on the immediate and direct causes of these outcomes, taking into account both deliberate and unintended actions, regardless of their intention or knowledge of rules. Understand that cause and effect can stem from a combination of multiple factors, sometimes overlapping or intersecting. Acknowledge that a single cause might have various effects, including inadvertent ones. When considering causality, do not overly rely on the actor's state of mind and motives; note that unintended actions can still have substantial outcomes. Causation does not always align with intentionality. Exercise prudence in making attributions about 'cause and effect' and remember: even if an actor’s intentions were not evident or an action appears accidental, it can still be causative. Remain aware that earlier actions, even when inadvertent or unknowing of rules, could have significant impact on the final outcome, regardless of chronological sequence of events.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze the series of events in the sequence they occur, the resulting outcomes, and the actions taken by the participants. Focus on the immediate and direct causes of these consequences, considering both intended and unplanned actions, regardless of the actor's primary objectives or understanding of rules. Recognize that cause and effect can result from an assortment of factors which may overlap or intersect. Consider the potential multiple effects that can be caused by a single action, including unintended ones. When evaluating causality, do not heavily lean on the actor's mindset or motives; observe that even unintended actions can lead to substantial consequences. Understand that causation does not necessarily equate to intentionality. Exercise caution when making assumptions about 'cause and effect' and remember: an action can still be causative, whether or not the actor’s intentions were clear or the action appeared accidental. Consideration should also be given to the fact that previous actions, even those undertaken unknowingly or inadvertently, could have a long-lasting impact on the final outcome. Furthermore, remind yourself that multiple persons can collectively cause an outcome and causality does not have to be tied to a single person but can be distributed among several actors. Distinguish between the actions that were merely side-effects of an intentional action and not intentional themselves. When determining causality, give more weight to the direct, immediate cause of the outcome rather than ancillary impacts.  <END>

   prompt: Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes. Be mindful of both direct influences - events that directly lead to a result - and indirect influences, which set the stage for other events to occur. Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence. In cases where multiple events contribute to a single effect, maintain a disciplined approach in evaluating the necessity - does the event need to occur for the outcome to happen? - and sufficiency - is the event alone enough to cause the outcome? - of each cause. Pay particular attention to the intended and usual function of each event, disregarding bias that may result from their sequence or from the presence of more than one cause. Consider the possibility of overlooked actions, omissions, or deviations from expected patterns and their potential as cause factors. Always differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. In complex scenarios, strive to untangle multiple intertwined causes, focusing on each event's true contribution and relevance to the outcome and guarding against any presumption rising from the traditional order or connection of events in the given context.

Pay attention to both the direct influences - actions that immediately lead to a result - and indirect influences, which pave the way for consequential actions. In your analysis, keep in mind that chronological order is not necessarily an indicator of cause and effect. Instead, each event should be evaluated for its actual impact on the final outcome, regardless of its order. In scenarios where multiple events influence the outcome, hold a balanced approach to determine their necessity - whether the event must happen for the outcome and their sufficiency - can the event alone cause the outcome. Pay heed to intended actions versus incidental outcomes. Consider the conventional function of each event and possible omission, avoidance or deviation from norms, disregarding biases that may arise from event sequencing or presence of multiple causes. Understand that not all outcomes resulting from an event are purposefully intended. Highlight the difference between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. Take into account responsibility and potential intervention in the outcomes. In complex situations, aim to dissect interlaced causes, accurately assessing each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, while keeping clear of any tendency to make assumptions based on traditional sequencing or causality. Remember to equally evaluate impact of actions and non-actions on the final outcome.

Remember, the chronological order of events does not necessarily show a cause-and-effect relationship. Each event should be scrutinized based on its actual impact on the final outcome, irrespective of the position it holds in the sequence. When outcomes are driven by multiple events, ensure a balanced judgment in determining the necessity of the event - is the event crucial for the outcome, and its sufficiency - can the event by itself trigger the outcome? Pay careful attention to actions that are intentional and those that have inadvertent outcomes. Understand the standard role of each event and any evasions, omissions, or deviations from standards, putting aside biases that may arise from the order of events or multiple causes. While not all outcomes are intentional, remember that knowledge of potential impacts can imply responsibility. Always differentiate between 'direct causes' and 'background causes' and consider who holds the responsibility and the potential for intervention in the outcomes. In layered situations, strive to tease apart intertwined causes, accurately gauging each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, avoiding any bias based on traditional sequence or causality. Always remember to equally appraise both actions and inactions and their impact on the final outcome. Focus on the direct question asked, considering the nuances of responsibility even when multiple causal factors are present.

   prompt: Thoroughly examine the sequence of events and critically evaluate their resulting outcomes to determine the cause-effect relationships. Be mindful of both direct influences that explicitly lead to a result and indirect influences that might pave the way for other resultant occurrences. Do not be swayed by the chronology of events; instead, focus on the impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its chronological position. When a single effect is influenced by multiple events, remain disciplined in your analysis of the necessity - whether the event is indispensable for the outcome- and sufficiency - if the event in itself is adequate to cause the outcome - of each cause. Make it a point to assess the inherent and defined function of each event while disregarding any biases that may originate from their sequence or from concurrent causes. Look out for actions, omissions, or deviations from the expected norm that might have been overlooked and understand their potential significance in the cause-effect equation. Acknowledge both 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes' and appreciate their distinctions. In intricate scenarios where several causes are interwoven, endeavor to extricate each cause, focusing on its true contribution to the outcome. Brace against any presumptions stemming from traditional sequences or connections of events within the given context. Comprehend the elements of chance, choice or contingency in the unfolding of events. Incorporate understanding from a human perspective when attributing causes to the situation at hand. Be especially attentive when addressing scenarios with multiple sufficient causes and treat all possible influences uniformly without bias. Register that the event's consequence is as important if not more than the event in itself.

   prompt: Assess the sequence of events, direct consequences, and individual actions. Prioritize the immediate causes behind these events, considering both intentional and unintentional actions irrespective of their conscious intent or awareness of rules. When analysing questions targeting a specific cause, evaluate the cause under focus rather considering a combination of causes. Be mindful that causes and their effects can emanate from multiple overlapping or intersecting factors. Accept that one cause can ignite diverse effects, including unexpected ones. Don't solely rely on the actor's intent or motives when assessing causality; acknowledge the fact that unintentional actions can induce significant effects. Causation is not always parallel to intentionality. In your judgment of 'cause and effect', exercise caution and understand that an action may still be causative, even if its actor’s intent was unclear or if the action seemed accidental. Keep in mind that earlier actions, whether willful or ignorant of rules, may significantly shape the final outcome, without being strictly tied to the chronological sequence of events. Always remember, regardless of the individual's role or responsibility, their actions or non-interventions may hold pivotal implications in the context of cause and effect.

   prompt: In any scenario, evaluate the role of each direct and indirect actor, considering potential errors in communication or actions, misunderstandings, or environmental influences. Keep in mind that multiple separate actions can independently lead to the same outcome. According to these terms, your task is to determine what or who played a causative role in a certain outcome. Evaluate each potential cause independently, accepting that shared or divided causation is possible. This process isn't about assigning blame, but identifying causative actions of each individual or event. It is also important to consider hypothetical scenarios where one actor's action is removed to understand if the same outcome would still occur. Remember, this exercise targets the understanding of "necessary" and "sufficient" causes for an outcome. With this in mind, please give your best judgment on the role of specific individuals or events in causing a particular outcome.

Remember, a necessary condition is one that must be present for an event to occur, while a sufficient condition is one that, if met, guarantees the event. In many instances, one direct action isn't the ultimate or only catalyst; there may be simultaneous or alternative causes at play. This could include miscommunications, actions, misunderstandings, or circumstantial influences. Understand that causation isn't always linear—one event leading directly to another—but often involves a series of interlinked actions over time. So keep contingencies, circumstantial elements, normative or rule-related factors, as well as potential multiple or alternative causes in mind. Now, with this nuanced understanding of causation, answer the following questions on causal attribution.

   prompt: Analyze both the direct and indirect influences, considering communication gaps, actions, misunderstandings, or circumstantial elements in situations. Highlight the influence of rule-related factors where appropriate and distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for an event. Also, acknowledge that multiple factors may contribute to an event, be it through alternative causes or simultaneous causes. Moreover, avoid overcomplication when a single causal action is evident. Keep in mind, in the assessment of intent, bear weightage on primary intent over possible outcomes. Lastly, strive to interpret the scenario from the perspective of a 'typical' person, understanding the distinction between intent, causation, recklessness or indifference. Based on this detailed understanding, respond to these questions about causal attribution.

   prompt: Taking into account both direct and indirect influences and possible lapses in communication, actions or circumstantial elements, critically assess the causal factors involved. Place strong emphasis on rules or norms that are in effect and distinguish between what is required and what is merely sufficient for a situation to transpire. Understand the possibility of multiple causes playing a part, whether concurrently or as alternatives. Accept that several elements might come together to result in a particular event. Including all these considerations, when responding to queries about cause and effect relationships, strictly stick to factual, event-based reasoning, and avoid drifting into moral attribution. Make sure to provide a summary of identified causes before you give final responses; this will aid in better understanding and interpretation of the scenario. Consider all the rules, norms, and instructions in the scenario carefully. If possible, present a concise timeline of events or a cause-effect relationship map. Lastly, solidify your understanding of the scenario by deliberately refuting incorrect options based on the provided factual context. Now, proceed to answer the following questions about causal attribution.

   prompt: Examine the events carefully and give thoughtful attention to their consequential outcomes. Be mindful of both direct influences - events that directly lead to a result - and indirect influences, which set the stage for other events to occur. Do not let the chronology of events sway your understanding of cause and effect; it's essential to evaluate the real impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its position in the sequence. In cases where multiple events contribute to a single effect, maintain a disciplined approach in evaluating the necessity - does the event need to occur for the outcome to happen? - and sufficiency - is the event alone enough to cause the outcome? - of each cause. Pay particular attention to the intended and usual function of each event, disregarding bias that may result from their sequence or from the presence of more than one cause. Consider the possibility of overlooked actions, omissions, or deviations from expected patterns and their potential as cause factors. Always differentiate between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. In complex scenarios, strive to untangle multiple intertwined causes, focusing on each event's true contribution and relevance to the outcome and guarding against any presumption rising from the traditional order or connection of events in the given context.

   prompt: Analyze carefully both the sequence of events and their succeeding consequences. Evaluate critically both overt and less obvious influences when answering the questions about cause-effect relationships within the given scenario. Avoid favoring event succession; however, do acknowledge the chronological order of the events. Actions and inactions alike can have significant contributions to the final outcome, so consider both when defining the cause of an outcome. When confronted with a situation where multiple causes might have led to a single effect, study diligently each cause's necessity and adequacy. Remain wary of any assumptions that might arise from their sequence or multiplicity. Remember that causes can be active or passive, and evaluate them based on their actual impact and importance towards the end result, not based on their active or passive nature. Finally, keep in mind that not adjusting to a situation can be equally causative to the outcome as making a change.

When addressing questions related to cause-effect relationships, consider both direct and indirect influences, as each event can have diverse impacts on the final result. Avoid biases due to event order or immediacy, instead, focus on evaluating the true contribution of each event towards the final outcome. In scenarios where multiple causes converge to a single outcome, analyze the role and contribution of each one individually. Be cautious of presumptions arising from the order of events or the presence of multiple causes. Recognize that a single effect can be precipitated by multiple causative agents, as well as exclusively by an immediate trigger. Be consistent in how you articulate the conclusion, conforming to the chosen response format to avoid ambiguity. Remember, there may be instances where multiple potential causes could lead to an effect, but in certain contexts, only one causative agent might instigate the result.

Take into consideration both immediate and distant influences when deconstructing questions about cause-effect relationships. Maintain your focus on the chronological order of events, while being cautious not to let immediacy or sequence bias your judgment. Assess each incident individually for its unique impact on the end result. When multiple causes contribute to a single effect, evaluate the separate influence of each cause. Stay alert against assumptions based on the sequence of events or presence of multiple causes. Acknowledge the role of both immediate catalysts and long-standing causes in your examination. The role of intent, especially in complex interactions involving luck or probability, should be carefully interpreted. Ensure to be coherent in conveying your conclusion with the provided response option, avoiding any ambiguity. Understand that sometimes, the effect might be a result of one specific cause, despite the presence of multiple potential causes. Contextualize your analysis considering both the conscious decisions and actions of the involved individuals as well as broader influencing factors.

   prompt: Thoroughly examine the sequence of events and critically evaluate their resulting outcomes to determine the cause-effect relationships. Be mindful of both direct influences that explicitly lead to a result and indirect influences that might pave the way for other resultant occurrences. Do not be swayed by the chronology of events; instead, focus on the impact of each event in relation to the final outcome, regardless of its chronological position. When a single effect is influenced by multiple events, remain disciplined in your analysis of the necessity - whether the event is indispensable for the outcome- and sufficiency - if the event in itself is adequate to cause the outcome - of each cause. Make it a point to assess the inherent and defined function of each event while disregarding any biases that may originate from their sequence or from concurrent causes. Look out for actions, omissions, or deviations from the expected norm that might have been overlooked and understand their potential significance in the cause-effect equation. Acknowledge both 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes' and appreciate their distinctions. In intricate scenarios where several causes are interwoven, endeavor to extricate each cause, focusing on its true contribution to the outcome. Brace against any presumptions stemming from traditional sequences or connections of events within the given context. Comprehend the elements of chance, choice or contingency in the unfolding of events. Incorporate understanding from a human perspective when attributing causes to the situation at hand. Be especially attentive when addressing scenarios with multiple sufficient causes and treat all possible influences uniformly without bias. Register that the event's consequence is as important if not more than the event in itself.

   prompt: Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes. Pay attention to both the direct influences - actions that immediately lead to a result - and indirect influences, which pave the way for consequential actions. In your analysis, keep in mind that chronological order is not necessarily an indicator of cause and effect. Instead, each event should be evaluated for its actual impact on the final outcome, regardless of its order. In scenarios where multiple events influence the outcome, hold a balanced approach to determine their necessity - whether the event must happen for the outcome and their sufficiency - can the event alone cause the outcome. Pay heed to intended actions versus incidental outcomes. Consider the conventional function of each event and possible omission, avoidance or deviation from norms, disregarding biases that may arise from event sequencing or presence of multiple causes. Understand that not all outcomes resulting from an event are purposefully intended. Highlight the difference between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes'. Take into account responsibility and potential intervention in the outcomes. In complex situations, aim to dissect interlaced causes, accurately assessing each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, while keeping clear of any tendency to make assumptions based on traditional sequencing or causality. Remember to equally evaluate impact of actions and non-actions on the final outcome.

   prompt: Carefully consider the presented scenario and pay thoughtful attention to the sequence of events leading to the final outcome. When tasked to identify causations, focus primarily on the specific event or action being questioned. Be mindful to differentiate between 'direct causes' - events that are immediately responsible for a result - and 'indirect causes' - events that lead to the manifestation of a direct cause. Evaluate each cause based on the necessity - did the event need to occur for the outcome to happen? - and sufficiency - did the event alone forge the outcome? - while answering. When multiple events are involved, avoid broad analysis and unnecessary complexity; stay centered on the question's immediate context and the individual event it focuses on. In intricate scenarios, isolate the direct cause relevant to the question from the surrounding events or triggers. Strive for clear, concise answers in line with the given options, ensuring the answer strictly aligns with the context of the question being asked. The goal is to accurately identify the cause or effect within the context of the specific question, rather than providing a broad, complex analysis of the entire situation.

   prompt: Analyze the events and their subsequent outcomes, giving emphasis to both direct influences leading to immediate results and indirect influences that set the backdrop for consequent actions. Maintain a neutral standpoint that chronological order doesn't necessarily reflect cause and effect. Instead, each event must be appraised individually for its factual contribution to the final outcome, irrespective of its sequence. In scenarios involving multiple events, strive for a balanced approach in delineating their necessity and sufficiency in leading to the outcome. Don't overlook the possible operational forms of each event or the potential for omittance, deviation or avoidance from the norm while discarding biases that may arise from sequence or multiple causality. Discern between purposeful outcomes of an event and those that are incidental. Distinguish between 'immediate causes' and 'underlying causes', and assess each action's contribution & relevance to the outcome apart from making assumptions based on traditional sequence or causality relevance. Take into account both actions and non-actions and their corresponding impact on the outcome. Consider both primary intentions (where the occurrence was the main goal) and anticipated incidental outcomes (events that were expected or accepted while achieving the main goal). Refrain from infusing judgments of morality into causality analysis.

   prompt: Critically analyze the sequence of events and their corresponding outcomes, focusing on both direct and indirect influences that lead to the results. Remember, the chronological order of events does not necessarily show a cause-and-effect relationship. Each event should be scrutinized based on its actual impact on the final outcome, irrespective of the position it holds in the sequence. When outcomes are driven by multiple events, ensure a balanced judgment in determining the necessity of the event - is the event crucial for the outcome, and its sufficiency - can the event by itself trigger the outcome? Pay careful attention to actions that are intentional and those that have inadvertent outcomes. Understand the standard role of each event and any evasions, omissions, or deviations from standards, putting aside biases that may arise from the order of events or multiple causes. While not all outcomes are intentional, remember that knowledge of potential impacts can imply responsibility. Always differentiate between 'direct causes' and 'background causes' and consider who holds the responsibility and the potential for intervention in the outcomes. In layered situations, strive to tease apart intertwined causes, accurately gauging each event's contribution and relevance to the outcome, avoiding any bias based on traditional sequence or causality. Always remember to equally appraise both actions and inactions and their impact on the final outcome. Focus on the direct question asked, considering the nuances of responsibility even when multiple causal factors are present.

   prompt: Analyze the sequence of events and their respective outcomes with a balanced approach, focusing on both immediate and indirect influences. While it's crucial to note the chronological order, don't mistake it as an indicator of cause and effect. Each event should be viewed in its specific context and evaluated based on its concrete impact on the ultimate outcome, regardless of its place in the timeline. During instances wherein multiple events contribute to the outcome, systematically determine their necessity - whether they are indispensable for the effect to happen, and their sufficiency - whether they can alone result in the outcome. Additionally, compare actions that were intended towards a result to the unintentional, incidental outcomes. Pay heed to the function each event typically serves and any potential lapses, avoidances, or divergences from norms that may occur. Be aware that biases can occur due to the sequencing of these events or multiple causative factors. Realize that not every event's outcome is purposely intended and distinguish between 'immediate causes' and ‘underlying causes’. Consider any possibilities of intervention or ownership in the outcomes. In complicated matters, strive to untangle mixed causes, accurately evaluating each event’s participation and relevance to the result, without making assumptions based on conventional sequencing or causality. Remember to assess the influence of actions and non-actions on the final outcome; just because an action was taken doesn't necessarily mean it contributed to the outcome, and the non-performance of an action shouldn't automatically lead to the assumption that it didn't contribute to the result. In scenarios where multiple causes can lead to one effect, question whether each factor was indeed necessary, not merely a condition present at the time.

Consider the broader context of the situation, and factor in any rules, policies, or agreements that exist. Address the complexities of causality by acknowledging both intentional and unintentional causes, whether they directly or indirectly contribute to the outcome. Be aware that a single cause can have multiple effects, some unintended, and a single effect may be the result of multiple intersecting or concurrent causes. Assess the state of mind and intentions of the actors at the time of the event, making a clear distinction between deliberate acts and accidental consequences. Understand that causation does not automatically imply intention, and direct evidence of premeditated action must be present to consider it as such. Exercise a high degree of critical evaluation, epistemic caution and sound judgement in inferring 'cause and effect' relationships. Remember that the latest action or the chronological last may not be the most influential cause for the eventual outcome. Earlier actions, violations of set rules, or the fulfillment of certain conditions, regardless of when they occur, can be pivotal in shaping the ending scenario.

   prompt: Conduct a detailed analysis of events in the chronological order of their occurrence, consequential outcomes, and individual actions' psychological motivations. Focus on the context, including any governing rules, policies, or logical conditions that could affect the outcome. Do not oversimplify causal relationships but instead acknowledge direct and indirect contributions of both deliberate and inadvertent causes. Understand how multiple, sometimes overlapping or intersecting causes can contribute to a single effect. Be mindful that a single cause can generate various unintended consequences.  Always evaluate actors' state of mind and motives at the time of the event, differentiating actions that resulted from deliberate intention from those with accidental outcomes. Remember, causation does not necessarily align with intentionality unless there's clear evidence of purposeful behavior. Do not overlook the possibility of single, independent causes being sufficient to cause an effect. Do not rush into attributing an effect to the latest action or implication, as earlier actions or violations of established rules could, despite the chronological order, impact the outcome significantly. When assessing causation, respect the roles of actions and rules both, attributing outcomes to rule violations when applicable and understanding the role of permitted actions as part of the normative background rather than as primary causes.

   prompt: Examine the sequence of events in chronological order, their resulting outcomes, and the intentional and unintentional actions of individuals. Emphasize on both the direct causes of these outcomes, as well as the indirect ones, considering the different factors that potentially intersect and overlap, giving rise to multiple potential effects, intended or otherwise. It is crucial to remember that an intentional action may result in unintentional side effects that the actor knew would happen but was indifferent towards; this is still a form of intentional causation. While evaluating causality, be careful not to overly consider the actors' intents and motivations; unintentional actions can have substantial effects. Causation does not always correlate with intentionality. When an individual's action contributes to an outcome, discern whether their action was a necessary cause or merely coincidental, as an outcome that would have occurred regardless of their contribution does not constitute causation by them. Understand that causality entails not only participation but also the necessity of an action for an outcome. Apply prudence in making attributions about 'cause and effect,' keeping in mind that intentionality is not always evident. An action, regardless of how accidental it appears or how indifferent the actor was to its rules or consequences, can still have causative properties. Lastly, keep in mind that preceding actions, whether intentional or unknowing of rules, could profoundly influence the final outcome, regardless of chronological sequences. The goal is to discern the underlying causal relationships in a nuanced, multi-faceted manner.

   prompt: Assess the sequence of events, direct consequences, and individual actions. Prioritize the immediate causes behind these events, considering both intentional and unintentional actions irrespective of their conscious intent or awareness of rules. When analysing questions targeting a specific cause, evaluate the cause under focus rather considering a combination of causes. Be mindful that causes and their effects can emanate from multiple overlapping or intersecting factors. Accept that one cause can ignite diverse effects, including unexpected ones. Don't solely rely on the actor's intent or motives when assessing causality; acknowledge the fact that unintentional actions can induce significant effects. Causation is not always parallel to intentionality. In your judgment of 'cause and effect', exercise caution and understand that an action may still be causative, even if its actor’s intent was unclear or if the action seemed accidental. Keep in mind that earlier actions, whether willful or ignorant of rules, may significantly shape the final outcome, without being strictly tied to the chronological sequence of events. Always remember, regardless of the individual's role or responsibility, their actions or non-interventions may hold pivotal implications in the context of cause and effect.

Focus on the immediate and direct causes of these consequences, considering both intended and unplanned actions, regardless of the actor's primary objectives or understanding of rules. Recognize that cause and effect can result from an assortment of factors which may overlap or intersect. Consider the potential multiple effects that can be caused by a single action, including unintended ones. When evaluating causality, do not heavily lean on the actor's mindset or motives; observe that even unintended actions can lead to substantial consequences. Understand that causation does not necessarily equate to intentionality. Exercise caution when making assumptions about 'cause and effect' and remember: an action can still be causative, whether or not the actor’s intentions were clear or the action appeared accidental. Consideration should also be given to the fact that previous actions, even those undertaken unknowingly or inadvertently, could have a long-lasting impact on the final outcome. Furthermore, remind yourself that multiple persons can collectively cause an outcome and causality does not have to be tied to a single person but can be distributed among several actors. Distinguish between the actions that were merely side-effects of an intentional action and not intentional themselves. When determining causality, give more weight to the direct, immediate cause of the outcome rather than ancillary impacts.
