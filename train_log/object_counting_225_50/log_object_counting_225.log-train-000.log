I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
I have a donkey, a dog, a mouse, a frog, a pig, a fish, two chickens, a cat, a rabbit, and a goat. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have 10 animals.

The correct label is: 11
The model's prediction is: 10.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
I have a lettuce head, three garlics, a flute, three carrots, a potato, a cauliflower, a yam, a head of broccoli, and an onion. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have 9 vegetables.

The correct label is: 12
The model's prediction is: 9.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 
The question in this example is a basic counting problem. The error in response originated from the miscounting of the two chickens as one entity. The language model might have calculated the number of animals as separate entities. Thus, the prompt leads to the wrong answer because it doesn't specifically state that the model needs to pay attention to numerals in front of the nouns as they indicate the quantity of that particular animal.

Example 2: 
In this question, the wrong answer was generated because the model computed the number of different types of vegetables without considering the quantities. The "three garlics" and "three carrots" should each be counted as three separate items. The prompt might have confused the model, making it count distinct types of vegetables instead of the total quantity.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Clarify The Task:
The initial prompt, "Answer questions about causal attribution", could be misleading for the model as neither of the examples provided falls under the theme of causal attribution. Reformulating the prompt to indicate the specific task (like counting the total number of items or considering quantities in front of nouns) could improve the accuracy of the model's responses.

2. Including Quantitative Complexity:
Specify in the prompts that all quantities specified in front of each item should be taken into account while providing an answer for a more accurate count.

3. Identify Content Topics:
Create prompts that distinguish between different kinds of tasks - like causal attribution vs. counting problems. This can help ensure that the model understands what is being asked more accurately.

4. Clearly Define Entity Types:
You could state in the prompt to consider the quantity of similar types when dealing with enumerations of the same entities or animals. This could help the model correctly calculate the total sum.

Overall, a more suitable instruction can be: "Count the total number of specified items considering quantities".

Wrong Example 1:

Prompt: Answer questions about causal attribution
Example's question: I have two accordions, three clarinets, a piano, a drum, a flute, a trombone, a violin, and a trumpet. How many musical instruments do I have?
Model's response: You have a total of 10 musical instruments.
Correct label: 11

Analysis: 
The issue at hand seems to be that the question asked is entirely unrelated to the original prompt. The prompt instructs the model to answer questions about causal attribution, which refers to determining what caused an event to happen. However, the question asked is a simple counting task - it involves no causality or attribution. 

One primary reason this prompt leads to a wrong answer is the mismatch between what the prompt asks the model to do, and the task at hand in the question. The model could have been confused as it was directed to focus on causal attribution, when the question really required simple arithmetics. 

A more minor issue could be that the model failed to correctly count the number of instruments, possibly due to a straightforward counting error, or misunderstanding of the individual instruments.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Make sure the prompt aligns with the type of questions: The prompt should clearly direct the model to the type of tasks or questions that it will be answering. In this case, if most questions are related to counting, the prompt could be "Answer questions related to counting the items." 
   
2. Specificity in instructions: The prompt should ideally instruct the model not just on the nature, but the approach to the task. A prompt like "Precisely count the number of items listed in each sentence" could better direct the model in this case. 

3. Clarity and simplicity of language: The language of the prompt should be clear and simple to facilitate model understanding. Instead of using terms such as 'causal attribution' that might confuse the model, the language of the input prompt should be simplified.  

In conclusion, the disconnect between the nature of the prompt and the actual question being asked seems to be the dominant issue in this model's performance. Realigning the prompt to better represent the tasks the model is actually required to perform could significantly improve the accuracy of its responses.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
1. Incorrect Interpretation: The model misinterpreted the number of vegetables. It did not recognize that "two cabbages" translates to two separate items, and not just one. It took the total count as 11, while it should be 13.
2. Prompt Irrelevancy: The prompt does not correspond with the input provided. The prompt requires answering questions about causal attribution, which denotes understanding the reasons behind particular actions, behaviors, or outcomes. However, the information provided is a list of vegetables, and the question is about counting, not cause-effect relationships.

Wrong Example 2:
1. Incorrect Counting: The model made an error in counting the musical instruments. It did not account for the 'accordion' as a musical instrument, giving the number 3 instead of 4.
2. Disconnect Between Prompt and Input: Just like the first example, the prompt does not match the question. The input here requires counting musical instruments, but the prompt asks to answer questions related to causal attribution.

Based on these observations, the following improvements could be made to the prompt:
1. Clarity: The prompt needs to reflect the type of questions that the model should answer. In the given examples, the prompt should be more applicable to counting items in a list.
2. Context-Specific Instructions: If the test involves different types of questions, contextualize the prompt for specific tasks. Instead of the current general prompt, a more specific one like "Count the number of items in the list" would be more suitable for these examples.
3. Right Information Processing: The prompt should be designed such that the model could comprehend all given inputs correctly, including understanding that phrases such as "two cabbages" signify two separate items.

gradient:
<1>
The model seems to be only considering individual items mentioned, regardless of the quantity of each item specified. Therefore, when the question mentions 'four potatoes,' the model counts this as one item rather than four. This flaw made the model give an incorrect answer.

<2>
Similar to the first case, the model fails to take into account the exact number of each item. It registers 'four accordions' as a single item rather than four separate ones as the question indicates.

<3>
This example also reflects the model's failure to count the exact number of items mentioned. In failing to count 'two drums' as two separate items, it comes up with an inaccurate answer.

<4>
Just like in the earlier examples, the model miscounts the total number of fruits by considering multiple quantities of a single item as only one. It does not correctly acknowledge 'four apples' as four separate items.

<5>
Yet again, the language model simply counts the different number of vegetables in the question, not the specific quantity of each type. Here, it counts 'three carrots' and 'three yams' each as a single item, not three.

From these examples, the model consistently fails to count the appropriate number of items when there are multiple quantities of a single item. It's possible that the model doesn't understand that it needs to include these quantities in its count.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Specify in the prompt that the model should consider the quantity applicable to each item. 
2. Emphasize the importance of counting each item individually, even when presented as a group or set.
3. The prompt could make it clear that the model is expected to deliver a mathematical calculation performed upon natural language data.

Question: I have a duck, a mouse, three pigs, two fish, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

The model's response is: There are six items mentioned in the question. 

Step by step examination:

- A possible reason for the model's wrong response might have been the misunderstanding of the word "items". Here, "items" refers to animals, not the distinct types of animals. 
- The model hasn't considered the quantity of each animal ("three pigs", "two fish") and took each as a single entity, resulting in the incorrect answer of six instead of eight.

<2> 
Question: I have three lettuce heads, a cabbage, a potato, a cauliflower, a carrot, a head of broccoli, a stalk of celery, and an onion. How many vegetables do I have?

The model's response is: You have 9 vegetables. 

Step by step examination:

- Similar to the first example, the model seems confused about the definition of "items". Here, "items" should refer to individual vegetable pieces, not the types of vegetables. 
- The model might have overlooked "three lettuce heads" considering it as one item, which resulted in the erroneous count of nine instead of ten.

Based on the above reasons, the following aspects can be considered to improve the prompt:

1. Be more specific: Instead of saying "items", explicitly instruct the model to consider the quantities associated with each item. For instance, "Count the number of animals mentioned in the question, considering the quantity mentioned for each animal."

2. Incorporate examples: Include a sample task in your prompt to provide context. For example, "If I say 'I have three ducks and two dogs,' the model should respond with '5' because there are three ducks and two dogs."

3. Prompt refinement: Encourage more precise interpretation by the model. E.g., "Determine the total quantity of all items mentioned in each question, considering each item's quantity, if specified."

4. Encourage comprehension: Instigate the model to fully understand the question before attempting to solve it. You could use prompts like, "Accurately comprehend and then count each item, including any numbers mentioned alongside them, in the questions."

5. Specify the output: Make sure the model knows the expected output is a number. Make it clear that the answer should be the total count of items, not just the count of different items mentioned in the question. E.g., "Respond with the total numerical count of all items under discussion in each question."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

This example's question is designed to test the AI's understanding of what can be classified as an 'animal'. But the prompt simply asks to "count the number of items mentioned in each question". The model seems to be identifying animals directly named, and doesn't count the 'toaster' as it's not an animal. Most likely, it has also not identified the 'snail' and 'bear' as animals, thus leading to the incorrect answer of 5 rather than the correct 7.

Example 2:

In the second example, the model's task should be to identify vegetables then count the number of vegetable items, including the quantities mentioned in the context (two onions, two cabbages, two heads of broccoli, two lettuce heads). However, the model is not identifying and processing these quantities accurately due to the ambiguity inherent in the original task prompt, leading it to miscount.

From these examples, it becomes clear that the model has trouble identifying categories correctly (like animal or vegetable). And even when it does, it struggles with properly quantifying them if the number exceeds one. These problems likely stem from the prompt's lack of specificity.

Aspect to improve the prompt:

1. Clarity: The prompt needs to specify that the task is about recognizing and counting items within a specific category (ex: vegetables, animals), which is mentioned in the questions.

2. Numerical identification: The prompt must instruct the model to factor multiples of the same item into its count.

3. Specificity: The instructions for counting need to be made specific to the question's context. For example, "animal" can be a broad term. The model should be prompt that if the question asks for number of animals, this might include any creature that falls under the category, not just the directly named ones.

4. Quantity recognition: The model also needs guidance where quantity recognition is concerned. It needs to be aware that some items might be mentioned together with a quantity word (e.g., "two bears", "three lettuce heads") and this should be factored into the final count. 

An improved prompt might look like this: Identify the category of items mentioned in each question. Then, count the number of those items, making sure to consider any quantity words (like 'two' or 'three') that would increase the item count.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The model incorrectly identified the total number of vegetables because the term "vegetables" was not clearly defined in the prompt. The model considered all items as vegetables, including fruits such as a banana, a raspberry, and a strawberry. Hence, the prediction was 7 items rather than the correct 5 items (garlic, potato, carrot, and two heads of broccoli).

Here are potential issues that led to the wrong answer by the model:

1. Lack of context: The expected response in the prompt is for a numerical total of all items mentioned. However, some questions may only be interested in certain items, as is the case in the example where we were only interested in the vegetables and not fruits. 

2. Lack of distinction: The prompt does not instruct the model to differentiate between different types of items.

3. Absence of specific categorization: The prompt does not prompt the model to count based on certain categories.

4. Misinterpretation: The model interpreted the prompt literally and included all the items mentioned in the question, regardless of their nature or category.

To improve the prompt, consider the following aspects:

1. Inclusion of context: Clarify that the model needs to consider the specific context of each example. 

2. Distinguishing between different categories: The prompt should instruct the model to distinguish between different types of items, such as fruits and vegetables.

3. Specify categorization: The prompt should guide the model to categorize the items based on the context of the question.

4. Clear instructions: Ensure the model understands the difference between the total number of items mentioned and the total number of items in a specific category.

New version of the prompt:
Analyze each question considering its specific context and identify the total number of individual items mentioned within the required category, making note of specific quantities if given.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this example, the model simply adds up the number of different items without considering the specific quantities of each when it should have taken into account the given quantities "four" for both celery and yams. This lack of attention to the presence of quantities means it displays an error in summing up the total amount of vegetables.

Example 2:
The model commits an overcounting error. It includes the total number of items, without segregating the vegetables from the non-vegetables. The prompt allows the model to count all items numerically mentioned under the assumption they are all relevant to the question, which misleadingly increases the final count.

Example 3:
Again, the model does a simplistic per-item count and ignores the quantities "five" for yams and "three" for lettuce heads. This type of error is characteristic of the model misunderstanding the significance of specific quantities attached to items.

Improvements:
Based on the issues, the prompt can be improved on the following aspects:
1. Reinforce the handling of specific quantities: The prompt should be more explicit about having the model note, understand, and apply the specified quantities for each item.
2. Introduce context-specific analysis: Emphasize on analyzing the context of the question. In this case, the model needs to identify that it must count only certain items (vegetables) and not all items mentioned.
3. Emphasize requirement understanding: The prompt should steer the model towards interpreting and considering the specific requirements of the question. The model should understand the difference between counting "items" and "kinds of items".
4. Enhance comprehension of plural forms: It appears the model didn't count 'lettuce heads' and 'yams' properly in their various quantities due to their form. The revised prompt should instruct the model to account for plural noun forms and the quantities associated with them.

3. Emphasize requirement understanding: The prompt should steer the model towards interpreting and considering the specific requirements of the question. The model should understand the difference between counting "items" and "kinds of items".
4. Enhance comprehension of plural forms: It appears the model didn't count 'lettuce heads' and 'yams' properly in their various quantities due to their form. The revised prompt should instruct the model to account for plural noun forms and the quantities associated with them.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

The model's response is: 
There are a total of 10 fruits mentioned in the question.

The correct label is: 11
The model's prediction is: 10.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

In this example, the language model correctly identified the number of fruits mentioned. The error in the prediction lies in the fact that the model incorrectly interpreted the "two ducks" as part of the count for the fruits. It is clear from the context of the question that ducks are not fruits. This implies that the model is unable to correctly discern between different types of items.

<2>

In the second example, the model failed to accurately count the total number of vegetables. It seems that the model did not consider that the question is referring to each individual item as a quantity. Therefore, the term 'a yam', 'an onion', and 'a carrot' each should be counted as one.

<3>

In the third example, the model again failed to accurately count the total number of fruits. Similar to the previous example, it appears the model has difficulty interpreting the quantity attached to each individual item. It seems that the model is having difficulty interpreting the number associated with 'three bananas' as 3 instead of 1 fruit, even though the question specifically mentions a quantity.

Reasons for the wrong answers:

1. The statement "identify the total number of individual items mentioned" may have led the model to assume that the question seeks to know the different types of items, not the sum of each item. This causes an inability to account for quantities for each individual item.
2. The prompt also requests to "making note of specific quantities if given" which might be confusing the model, causing it to ignore quantities when no specific note is provided.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that the model should be counting each individual item and not just different types of items. A possible improvement can be: "Analyze each question and account for each individual item mentioned separately, and add the quantities when given."
2. Include an indication that everything mentioned might not be needed for the answer. A possible addition: "Be sure to only include relevant categories when determining counts."
3. Explicitly state that the model should not ignore quantities when no specific note is given. This can be along the lines of: "Even if no specific note is provided for the quantities, each item mentioned should be counted as 1 unless otherwise specified."

<3> In this case, the model underestimated the total by considering 'four fish' as one item instead of representing four individual animals. The model may be struggling with quantifiers and might not be understanding the quantity of the items in the input. It interprets 'four fish' as one item and miscounts.

<4> Similar to the third example, this case indicates a misunderstanding of quantity. The model doesn't count 'three accordions' and 'three trumpets' correctly and interprets them as one individual item each.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Specify that items should be individually counted, even if they belong to the same category.
2. Clearly mention that, when a quantity is provided for a type of item, that quantity should be multiplied with the item to arrive at the total.
3. Incorporate the understanding that the quantity of each item may be provided individually and that the model should count each item regardless of its type.
4. The definition of 'item' or 'unit' should be expanded to include the understanding that each individual entity counts as one unit, even if multiple of them are grouped together.

gradient:
<1> 
Problem: This question requires the model to both count quantities and categorize items - fruits versus non-fruits. The model's mistake comes in the categorization. It acknowledges that the list contains more than just fruits, but it still counts the non-fruits in the total.

<2> 
Problem: The model wrongly ignores the five grapes and counts them as one because the prompt didn’t clarify that it should count individual grapes.

<3> 
Problem: Similar to the first example, this question requires counting and categorizing different items. The model recognizes vegetables, but miscounts the number due to its failure to correctly process quantity expressions like "a stalk of celery."

<4> 
Problem: Again, the model seems to have issues with expressions of quantity. In "a stalk of celery," it counts the item as one whole piece instead of considering the celery individually.

<5> 
Problem: There doesn't seem to be an issue with the model's understanding of the question or counting in this example. However, the model's prediction being off by one suggests it is not considering the first item in the list in its total.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Make the prompt explicitly mention the need to discern between different kinds/categories of items mentioned in the question, if the question requires it.
2. Include explicit instructions in the prompt on handling collective nouns or quantity expressions (like a bunch of grapes, a stalk of celery) to ensure accurate counting.
3. Make the prompt instruct the model in handling cases where multiple quantities are mentioned in the question.
4. Add a quality check to ensure the model counts all items in a list correctly before determining their categories.

The correct label is: 2
The model's prediction is: 1.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Problem: This question requires the model to both count quantities and categorize items - fruits versus non-fruits. The model's mistake comes in the categorization. It acknowledges that the list contains more than just fruits, but it still counts the non-fruits in the total.

<2> 
Problem: The model wrongly ignores the five grapes and counts them as one because the prompt didn’t clarify that it should count individual grapes.

<3> 
Problem: Similar to the first example, this question requires counting and categorizing different items. The model recognizes vegetables, but miscounts the number due to its failure to correctly process quantity expressions like "a stalk of celery."

<4> 
Problem: Again, the model seems to have issues with expressions of quantity. In "a stalk of celery," it counts the item as one whole piece instead of considering the celery individually.

<5> 
Problem: There doesn't seem to be an issue with the model's understanding of the question or counting in this example. However, the model's prediction being off by one suggests it is not considering the first item in the list in its total.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Make the prompt explicitly mention the need to discern between different kinds/categories of items mentioned in the question, if the question requires it.
2. Include explicit instructions in the prompt on handling collective nouns or quantity expressions (like a bunch of grapes, a stalk of celery) to ensure accurate counting.
3. Make the prompt instruct the model in handling cases where multiple quantities are mentioned in the question.
4. Add a quality check to ensure the model counts all items in a list correctly before determining their categories.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model under-counted the total number of animals due to overlooking the "two" in "two plums". Even though a "plum" is not an animal, the numerical quantifier should have been carried over to the next item, "a duck," making it "two ducks" instead of one. This misunderstanding seems to have occurred because the prompt is not clear enough about how the numerical quantifiers apply to the items mentioned.

<2> 
In the second example, the model miscounted the total number of fruits. In particular, it categorized "three ducks" as fruits, which led to an overestimation of the total fruit count. This shows that the model had difficulty distinguishing between different categories of items (i.e., fruits and animals) within the same statement. The prompt needs to clarify this aspect for improved results.

<3> 
In the third example, the model seriously under-counted the total number of vegetables. It seems that the model did not correctly interpret and apply the prompt to the question. It might have encountered confusion in dealing with more complex multi-item statements, particularly those involving different types of vegetables. This suggests that the prompt needs to be more specific about handling such complexity.

Improving the prompt:

Following the above observations, the prompt can be improved in several ways:

1) Make clear how the model should interpret numerical quantifiers and apply them to each item in a list. 

2) Explicitly state that the task involves identifying and counting only certain categories of items, regardless of other items mentioned in the same statement.

3) Provide guidance on handling more complex multi-item statements. For example, the prompt could specify that the model has to take each item mentioned into account and consider the quantity of the item mentioned before it.

4) It could be useful to include an instruction on ignoring irrelevant objects in the question, specifying that the objects to be considered will be directed by the query ("How many X do I have?").

A refined prompt could be: "Count and sum up the total number of specific items or units mentioned in the question (e.g., animals, fruits, or vegetables), carefully interpreting numerical quantities associated with each named item and distinguishing between different categories and types of items within the statement. Do not count objects that are not relevant to the specific ask in the question."

gradient:
<1> 
This question involves counting the total number of objects mentioned, irrespective of the type of object. The model incorrectly categorizes each type of item (chair, table, fridge) as separate quantities and returns a count of 1 for each, rather than counting the total number of objects overall.

<2> 
Here, the model seems to understand the need to count the total number of animals but it mistakenly doesn't include the quantity detail of four frogs and three violins in the count. It therefore counts 1 for each type of animal, resulting in a total of 10 rather than the correct answer of 13.

<3> 
In this question, the model correctly identifies the need to count all objects, including multiplying where quantities are specified (e.g., for toasters, couches, and ovens). It seems to have processed the prompt correctly in this instance and returned the correct comprehensive count of 14.

Reasons for Incorrect Answers:
1. Misinterpretation of the task: The model may be incorrectly interpreting the task as to separately count each type of item, rather than counting the total sum of items. 
2. Ignoring quantity details: The model sometimes neglects to count specified quantities of certain items.
3. Mistakenly considering each item as a separate quantity: The model incorrectly categorizes each type of item as separate quantities and return a count of 1 for each.

Improvement aspects of the prompt:

1. The term "specified item" in the prompt could be leading the model to believe each type of item should be calculated separately. Changing "specified item" to "all items" could help to rectify this.
2. Adding an instruction in the prompt to pay attention to quantities mentioned for each item, and to add together all items regardless of type may help improve the model's understanding of the task.
3. In the context of training, it may be helpful to include a variety of examples that consider different types of counting tasks, including those with quantities specified and without. This could help the model to improve its counting capability. 
4. Specify in the prompt to count the 'total number of items in all' or the 'sum of all items' to help the model understand when to aggregate counts.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The incorrect prediction seems to be down to the language model failing to recognize "trumpet" as a musical instrument, and therefore not including it in the total count.

Example 2:
The error in this example seems to be a result of the model not taking into account the multiple quantities of individual items. Here, the model has given each item (including those with quantities mentioned, such as two lettuce heads) a count of one.

Example 3:
Like the previous example, the model wrongly gives each mentioned item a count of one, regardless of specified quantities. This leads to an underestimation of the total number of items.

Example 4:
Though the model correctly identifies the total number of fruits, there seems to be a systemic issue with the predictions all being off by a certain measure - in this case, the prediction is lower than the correct answer.

Based on these issues, we can observe the following aspects that can be improved:

1. The model needs to better recognize and classify objects as per their types.
2. The prompt needs to emphasize the importance of considering mentioned quantities when counting the total number of items. For instance, we could improve the prompt with a specification like "Count the total number of each specified item, considering both single items and multiple quantities of the same item."
3. There seems to be an inherent issue with the predictions being off by a certain margin, indicative of a potential systematic error that needs to be investigated and rectified.

You have a total of 6 vegetables: 2 lettuce heads, 1 cauliflower, 1 carrot, 1 cabbage, and 1 yam.

The correct label is: 6
The model's prediction is: 1.

The model's input is:
Count the total number of each specified item, taking into account the quantities mentioned for each.
I have a car, a toaster, four tables, a microwave, two lamps, a chair, a fridge, a couch, and two stoves. How many objects do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 13 objects:
1 car
1 toaster
4 tables
1 microwave
2 lamps
1 chair
1 fridge
1 couch
2 stoves

The correct label is: 14
The model's prediction is: 2.

<4> 
The model's input is:
Count the total number of each specified item, taking into account the quantities mentioned for each.
I have a blackberry, a raspberry, and a grape. How many fruits do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 3 fruits - 1 blackberry, 1 raspberry, and 1 grape.

The correct label is: 3
The model's prediction is: 1.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:
The incorrect prediction seems to be down to the language model failing to recognize "trumpet" as a musical instrument, and therefore not including it in the total count.

Example 2:
The error in this example seems to be a result of the model not taking into account the multiple quantities of individual items. Here, the model has given each item (including those with quantities mentioned, such as two lettuce heads) a count of one.

Example 3:
Like the previous example, the model wrongly gives each mentioned item a count of one, regardless of specified quantities. This leads to an underestimation of the total number of items.

Example 4:
Though the model correctly identifies the total number of fruits, there seems to be a systemic issue with the predictions all being off by a certain measure - in this case, the prediction is lower than the correct answer.

Based on these issues, we can observe the following aspects that can be improved:

1. The model needs to better recognize and classify objects as per their types.
2. The prompt needs to emphasize the importance of considering mentioned quantities when counting the total number of items. For instance, we could improve the prompt with a specification like "Count the total number of each specified item, considering both single items and multiple quantities of the same item."
3. There seems to be an inherent issue with the predictions being off by a certain margin, indicative of a potential systematic error that needs to be investigated and rectified.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The first erroneous example indicates that the language model didn't comprehend the prompt correctly. It wasn't asked to categorize the items into animals or non-animals. Therefore, it missed the snail and rabbit as animals. The language model failed to make the correct prediction because the prompt was focused more on counting items, with no special emphasis on comprehending their types or categories.

<2> 
The second error in the model's prediction also mirrors the issue in the first situation. The language model didn't seem to properly understand the prompt's requirement to classify items into their respective categories, in this case, fruits. It simply counted the elements without considering their contextual meaning. 

From the above examples, it's evident that the language model struggled to understand the nuance of categorizing items, even though it could understand the function of counting items. Hence, the main issue lies in the model's inability to classify items according to their respective types/categories.

Improvements:
1. Make the prompt more specific: The prompt could be clearer in terms of guiding the model to classify items into their respective categories before counting. 
2. Set clear instructions: The language should clearly instruct the model to categorize the items and consider their quantities. 
3. Contextual understanding: The wording of the prompt could indicate the importance of understanding the context in which individual items are used or mentioned.
4. The Language model training: Training the model with more datasets that carry similar tasks may improve its predictive performance.

gradient:
Example 1:
The main problem with the response in this example is that the model has not correctly interpreted the quantities assigned to the donkeys and the dogs. Instead of counting them as 4 and 3 respectively, it has counted them as 1 each. This indicates that the model didn't understand the instruction regarding the consideration of quantities for each specified item.

Example 2:
In this example, the model made a similar mistake to the first example. The quantities specified for the fridges and the lamps have not been correctly interpreted. Instead of counting the fridges and lamps as 3 and 2 respectively, they have been counted as 1 each.

In both examples, the model correctly organized the items into categories and recognized the significance of the items in their contexts, but failed to correctly calculate the total quantity. 

Reasons for Misinterpretation:
1. The instruction about considering quantities may not be clear enough, which resulted in the model considering all given items as single entities, irrespective of their assigned quantities.
2. The model might have trouble understanding the importance of the word 'each.' The term 'each' may have led the model to count each type of item as one, even when quantities are specified. 

Improvements:
1. Make the instruction regarding the consideration of quantities clearer. 
2. Reiterate the importance of considering the quantities assigned to each item.
3. Make it clear that the quantity of a specific item could be more than one.
4. Incorporate a clarification that different types of a broader category each have their own counts, and these should not default to one when quantities are specified.

gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the model interpreted each unique type of vegetable as a single "item," not taking into account the quantities mentioned in the task. Therefore, although it correctly recognized the six types of vegetables present, it did not factor in the stated quantities of onions and yams, ultimately leading to an undercount.

<2> 
Similarly in the second example, the model correctly sorted all the vegetables and identified the correct number of each type. However, it misunderstood 'four garlics' as four different species of garlic, when it should have been counted as four individual units, just like the three stalks of celery.

<3> 
In the third example, the model reduced the count, and it appears that it did not consider both the cow and the donkey as individual items or units. It may have categorized the cow and the donkey under the same category (animals), resulting in the incorrect conclusion that there is only one item in the category.

Increasing the clarity and specifying the instructions in the prompt could prevent these types of errors. Specifically, the prompt could be improved by:

1. Emphasizing that quantities should be considered. Instead of only stating "taking into account the quantities mentioned for each," it would be helpful to stress that the quantities listed should be added together for the final total.

2. Clarifying that each individual item should be counted, not just unique types of items. This could prevent misunderstandings like the one in the third example, where multiple items of the same type are present.

3. Specifying that the total means the sum of all items and not the sum of categories.

4. Making clear that items with the same count are not interpreted as different species but as individual units of the same category.

gradient:
Example 1 analysis:
- The initial part of the prompt, "Sort the given items into their respective categories", is correctly understood and performed by the model as it correctly places the items into vegetable and animal categories.
- Similarly, "understand their significance based on the context" is correctly interpreted as the model identified distinct categories.
- However, the model misinterprets "and then count the total number of each specified item in every category, taking into account the quantities mentioned for each" - it provides the number of categories rather than the number of items in the requested category. 

Example 2 analysis:
- The model correctly discerns categories (Furniture, Appliances, Miscellaneous). 
- However, it fails when it comes to "count the total number of each specified item in every category, taking into account the quantities mentioned for each." The model considers the "two lamps" and "three stoves" as one item each, rather than accounting for their quantities.

Reasons for errors:
- The instruction is not directly clear about considering quantity while counting. The phrase "taking into account the quantities mentioned for each" could mean both considering quantity for each category or each item.
- The model may need explicit training on the understanding of quantities in text, like "two lamps", "three stoves" should be considered as two and three items respectively.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
- Make explicit that quantities need to be considered individually rather than in a category.
- Clarify that the goal is to find the total number of items in the specific/requested categories.
- The prompt could simply be “Identify categories based on given items, then count the total number of items per category considering their individual quantities. Specify the total quantity in the requested category."

For example: 
"Identify categories based on these items, and count the items in each category considering their individual quantities: a carrot, a potato, a yam, a dog, a cauliflower, a stalk of celery, and a chicken. How many vegetables are there?" With such a prompt, the model has clear instructions to count per item, not per category.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Why it's wrong: The model fails to accurately count the vegetables. It's only considering individual types of vegetables as single units, irrespective of their quantity. This is why the count is 12, despite there being 13 vegetables in total when you account for the multiple quantities of certain vegetables (two heads of broccoli and two onions).

<2>
Why it's wrong: This error appears to be a classification mistake. The model is viewing cauliflower as a fruit instead of a vegetable, which has overinflated its count of fruits to 2 instead of the correct count of 1.

<3>
Why it's wrong: In this instance, it seems that the model has counted the quantities of certain vegetables as one instead of considering the precise quantities assigned to them (three carrots and two heads of broccoli). Therefore, it’s total count is 10 rather than the correct 12.

<4>
Why it's wrong: Similar to the first example, the model is incorrectly counting multi-quantity items as single units. This is reflected in its count of 11 objects, despite there being 12 objects in total when you consider the two toasters, two stoves, and five chairs.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Clarify the need to count each individual item, even if they appear as multiples of the same type in the sentence. Specify that an item appearing multiple times should be counted separately each time it appears.
2. Further emphasize the distinction between different categories; the model should be able to correctly categorize all items in the list and only count those within the specified category.
3. Explicitly state the importance of differentiating between singular and plural quantities in item listings.
4. Offer illustrative examples that distinguish individual counts from category counts, and singular from plurals. Providing clear examples may facilitate the model's ability to approach the task more effectively.

gradient:
Wrong example reasonings:

1. The prompt instructs the model to "sort the items into appropriate categories," but does not clarify how to categorize. In this case, the model should categorize all inputs as vegetables, but that's not specifically mentioned.

2. While the prompt does mention to consider quantities specified for each item, it's not emphasized enough. The model fails to acknowledge "four cabbages," counting it as one item instead of four.

3. Even though the prompt specifies the "final count should reflect the precise quantities," it may still be interpreted as counting the types of items, leading to the model's incorrect output. In particular, the model is treating the combination of "four cabbages" as a single item.

4. The prompt does not explicitly provide guidelines for interpreting questions like "How many vegetables do I have?" The model could interpret this as either the number of types of vegetables or the total amount of individual vegetable items.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Explicit instructions should be given to make the model understand the types of items in categorization, not the individual items in each category.

2. The model needs clear instructions to take into account the quantity of each type of item rather than counting it as one, especially when the expression is "number + noun."

3. Emphasise that if a quantity is defined, it should be multiplied with the type of item to get the total number of that item in the task.

4. Include instructions for the model to interpret the questions like "How many vegetables do I have?" specifically as asking for the total quantities of items, not the number of categories or types of items.

5. Address that the "final count" means the total number of items, not the number of types of items.

I have a carrot, a cauliflower, a garlic, a yam, four cabbages, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
- Carrot
- Cauliflower
- Cabbage (4)
- Yam
- Potato

Total number of vegetables: 7

The correct label is: 9
The model's prediction is: 7.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong example reasonings:

1. The prompt instructs the model to "sort the items into appropriate categories," but does not clarify how to categorize. In this case, the model should categorize all inputs as vegetables, but that's not specifically mentioned.

2. While the prompt does mention to consider quantities specified for each item, it's not emphasized enough. The model fails to acknowledge "four cabbages," counting it as one item instead of four.

3. Even though the prompt specifies the "final count should reflect the precise quantities," it may still be interpreted as counting the types of items, leading to the model's incorrect output. In particular, the model is treating the combination of "four cabbages" as a single item.

4. The prompt does not explicitly provide guidelines for interpreting questions like "How many vegetables do I have?" The model could interpret this as either the number of types of vegetables or the total amount of individual vegetable items.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Explicit instructions should be given to make the model understand the types of items in categorization, not the individual items in each category.

2. The model needs clear instructions to take into account the quantity of each type of item rather than counting it as one, especially when the expression is "number + noun."

3. Emphasise that if a quantity is defined, it should be multiplied with the type of item to get the total number of that item in the task.

4. Include instructions for the model to interpret the questions like "How many vegetables do I have?" specifically as asking for the total quantities of items, not the number of categories or types of items.

5. Address that the "final count" means the total number of items, not the number of types of items.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this example, the model failed to count the number of dogs specified. It counted one dog instead of five. This may be due to the prompt not being clear enough in clarifying that numbers attached to each item should be counted as the actual quantity of the item, and not as a single item. It seems like the model understood the prompt in abstract terms or general concepts but struggled with specific enumeration.

Example 2:
The model correctly identified the types of fruits mentioned, but made an error in quantity. Similar to the first example, it ended up counting the types of fruits rather than the total number of individual fruits. It seems there is a confusion in the model's understanding of 'items' versus 'types of items,' which maybe because the prompt lacks clear instructions for counting the items and understanding their context.

Example 3:
In this example, the model failed to recognize that the "three cows" count as three individual animals. It seems that when the model has to count an unspaced numerical value put in front of the noun, it gets confused and counts them as one. It also added a category division between mammals and fish, which indicates that creating categories for context might not be entirely useful when the task has simple computation.

Example 4:
The model correctly formed various categories of vegetables, but again miscounted the number of cabbages and garlics. This indicates that the model had difficulty processing the quantities when assigned to each type of individual item. 

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Make the instructions more explicit about the need to recognize and consider the specified quantities for each type of item. Use simple and straight forward language.

2. Include instructions to distinguish between counting types of items and quantities of individual items. 

3. Explicitly instruct the model to consider numbers attached to nouns as quantities, especially when in front of nouns.

4. Instructions about taking into account the context and creating categories might be redundant when the problem is about plain counting. It might be better to also include a specific directive for instances where categorization is unnecessary, but accurate quantity counting is crucial.

5. Instruction can include an example of how to count correctly to give the model a better context of how it should execute the task.

gradient:
<1> 

Question: I have a fridge, a table, two couches, a microwave, two chairs, and a bed. How many objects do I have?

Wrong Answer: 7

Reason: The model made a mistake in counting the total number of items. It correctly identified the categories as furniture and appliances and also defined their significance within the context. However, it failed to accurately count the total numbers. In this case, the model interpreted the phrase "two couches" as one item, instead of counting them as different units.

<2> 

Question: I have a peach, an onion, two garlics, a nectarine, a yam, a carrot, a potato, a head of broccoli, a cabbage, a banana, and a stalk of celery. How many vegetables do I have?

Wrong Answer: 8

Reason: The model appeared to classify the items correctly, but faltered in the counting process. The statement has "two garlics," which should have been considered as two different items. Evidently, the model counted two garlics as just one individual item.

<3> 

Question: I have four cauliflowers, a lettuce head, a garlic, a yam, a cabbage, a stalk of celery, a head of broccoli, a potato, an onion, and a carrot. How many vegetables do I have?

Wrong Answer: 11

Reason: The model has difficulty handling tasks involving quantities multiply attached to individual items. This is evident when four cauliflowers are treated as a single entity rather than four separate units. 

Improvement Suggestions:

1. The prompt needs to be clearer about treating quantities associated with items as individual units. For example, "always count items with a stated quantity greater than one (such as 'two couches') as separate, individual items, not just one total item."
  
2. The model may benefit from a reiteration within the prompt to ensure it pays careful attention to the numerals or quantity expressions associated with each item. 

3. An explicit alert should be included in instructions that the total count should include all specified quantities of every individual item, not just the variety of items. 

4. The concept of individual items versus types can be reiterated, making it more evident that repeated items should be considered in the count.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Classify the provided items according to their categories, identify their individual significance within the context, and calculate the total of every item specified. Ensure you count each individual item, regardless of whether there are multiples of the same type, and not just unique item types. Add together the quantities stated for each, as the total should reflect the sum of all individual units, not the sum of categories or types. Always interpret items with the same count as individual units in one category, not as different species. Dedicate careful attention to context clues when determining the significance of each "item".

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

Question: I have a fridge, a table, two couches, a microwave, two chairs, and a bed. How many objects do I have?

Wrong Answer: 7

Reason: The model made a mistake in counting the total number of items. It correctly identified the categories as furniture and appliances and also defined their significance within the context. However, it failed to accurately count the total numbers. In this case, the model interpreted the phrase "two couches" as one item, instead of counting them as different units.

<2> 

Question: I have a peach, an onion, two garlics, a nectarine, a yam, a carrot, a potato, a head of broccoli, a cabbage, a banana, and a stalk of celery. How many vegetables do I have?

Wrong Answer: 8

Reason: The model appeared to classify the items correctly, but faltered in the counting process. The statement has "two garlics," which should have been considered as two different items. Evidently, the model counted two garlics as just one individual item.

<3> 

Question: I have four cauliflowers, a lettuce head, a garlic, a yam, a cabbage, a stalk of celery, a head of broccoli, a potato, an onion, and a carrot. How many vegetables do I have?

Wrong Answer: 11

Reason: The model has difficulty handling tasks involving quantities multiply attached to individual items. This is evident when four cauliflowers are treated as a single entity rather than four separate units. 

Improvement Suggestions:

1. The prompt needs to be clearer about treating quantities associated with items as individual units. For example, "always count items with a stated quantity greater than one (such as 'two couches') as separate, individual items, not just one total item."
  
2. The model may benefit from a reiteration within the prompt to ensure it pays careful attention to the numerals or quantity expressions associated with each item. 

3. An explicit alert should be included in instructions that the total count should include all specified quantities of every individual item, not just the variety of items. 

4. The concept of individual items versus types can be reiterated, making it more evident that repeated items should be considered in the count. 

5. Incorporate clearer directions about treating each and every object with multiple counts as separate entities, and not just as a single unit.

6. Consider adding an explicit instruction section related to counting to prevent any undercounting mistakes.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution

(3) Classify the provided items according to their categories, identify their individual significance within the context, and calculate the total of every item specified. Ensure you count each individual item, regardless of whether there are multiples of the same type, and not just unique item types. Add together the quantities stated for each, as the total should reflect the sum of all individual units, not the sum of categories or types. Always interpret items with the same count as individual units in one category, not as different species. Dedicate careful attention to context clues when determining the significance of each "item".

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Issue: The model incorrectly identified the count of animals as "1". 

Reason: Although the prompt clearly stated to consider individual units, not just unique types, the model still failed to count the three different animals as three individual units. 

Example 2:

Issue: The model incorrectly identified the total count of objects as "12", not "14". 

Reason: Though the model successfully classified the items into categories (Furniture, Appliances, and Vehicle), it failed to correctly count the total number of items. This suggests that the model might have misinterpreted the task and possibly considered "three stoves" as one item, likewise for "three toasters" and "three couches" which reduced the correct count from 14 to 12.

Example 3:

Issue: The model incorrectly identified the total count of objects as "1". 

Reason: Similar to Example 1, despite the prompt clearly instructing to consider individual units, the model failed to count the three different items - two chairs and a bed, as three individual units. 

In the light of these observations, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:

1. Clarification: Ensure that the model understands the difference between item types and individual units. Just because two items belong to the same type, they shouldn't be counted as one but as two individual items.

2. Detailing of Instructions: Make the prompt more explicit and illustrative regarding how to interpret and count the items. 

3. Aggregation: Further emphasize the concept of summing the quantity of all specified items, regardless of their categories.

4. Simplicity: Reduce the complexity of the prompt by avoiding ambiguous phrases, such as "items with the same count as individual units in one category, not as different species", which can confuse the model.

5. Context Sensitivity: Make sure the prompt has enough instructions for the model to follow the context, especially when counting the total number of objects. 

6. Concrete Examples: Including small examples in the prompt can help the model understand the task better. 
   
7. Error Analysis: It's also important to carry out an error analysis to understand what specific aspects of the task the model is struggling with, and accordingly create a detailed prompt that addresses these issues. 

By focusing on these aspects, the prompt can be significantly improved, allowing the model to answer accurately and correctly.

This could be because the model is considering the vegetables as one category, despite the instruction to count each individual item.

<2> 

Here, the model is asked to count the total number of animals. While it correctly accounted for individual item counts for the animals, it failed to add the two chickens correctly in the total count, making its prediction as 9 instead of the correct answer, 10. It seems the model overlooked or did not comprehend the quantity stated for the chickens, even though the prompt asked it to add together the quantities stated for each item.

<3> 

In this scenario, the model is asked to count the total number of musical instruments. Similar to the previous example, the model didn't correctly account for the multiple accordions, pianos, and trombones, and returned a prediction of 10 instead of the correct total of 11. Again, the model did not comprehend the "two" mentioned before these items despite rather clear instructions in the prompt.

As per these examples, the problem repeatedly seems to be in the model's understanding and handling of individual item counts, particularly when there are multiple items of the same kind. The model seems to be registering only individual unique items and ignoring when a quantity is stated before an item.

To improve the prompt, emphasize the need to pay attention to quantities mentioned before each item and ensure that the sum of all items, not just unique ones, is counted. Tailor the language so it's clear that the 'total' should reflect the sum of all individual items, even if there are multiples of the same item. Also, make the language a bit simpler - too many instructions could be confusing the model. The simpler, the better.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Classify the provided items according to their categories, identify their individual significance within the context, and calculate the total of every item specified. Ensure you count each individual item, regardless of whether there are multiples of the same type, and not just unique item types. Add together the quantities stated for each, as the total should reflect the sum of all individual units, not the sum of categories or types. Always interpret items with the same count as individual units in one category, not as different species. Dedicate careful attention to context clues when determining the significance of each "item".

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In the model's input, the items description includes quantities such as "a potato" (1 potato) and "two cabbages" (2 cabbages). The model didn't distinguish between singular and plural instances of items. It appears to count each instance (both singular and plural) as one item only. 

<2>
Similarly in the second example, the model failed to recognize multiple instances of musical instruments. It didn't associate the quantity "three" with "violins" and "four" with "clarinets". Therefore, it undercounted the total number of musical instruments.

<3>
The same issue as the first two examples can be seen here. The model could not recognize that "four lettuce heads" referred to four separate vegetables, rather than a single item. Hence, it undercounted the actual number of vegetables.

<4>
Consistent with the previous examples, the model could not recognize that "three nectarines" meant three separate fruits.

In summary, the root of the problem lies in the prompt's failure to specify that the model needs to consider the quantities of each item. The model misunderstands counting each "mention" of an item as a singular entity, without taking into account if multiple quantities of the same item have been listed.

To improve the prompt:

1. Modify the prompt to elaborate the task more clearly. For instance: "Analyze the list, taking into account the number associated with each item and calculate the total count of the specific items requested."

2. Make it explicit for the model that quantities associated with items should be considered during the computation.

It's essential that the prompt encourages the model to execute a task-specific comprehension, where it accounts for both the type and quantity of items in a given list.

<1>
In this question, the model failed to account for the count of three bananas that were specified. The prompt doesn't specify whether the model should consider the quantitative words like "three" in the input while counting. Therefore, it might have failed to clearly instruct the model to take into account such details which led to the wrong prediction.

<2>
The situation here is fairly similar. The model hasn't counted the "two donkeys" and "three ducks" separately but took them as individual items. The prompt doesn't instruct the model to consider multiple counts of the same item separately. Thus, it lacks a clear specification about treating multiple occurrences of an item as multiple items.

<3>
Again, the model fails to account for the distinct counts of "three couches", "four microwaves" as separate items and treated them as single items. The prompt doesn't guide the model to understand that multiple counts of items should be treated as such.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. More explicit instruction: Make clear in the prompt that the model should take note of and count items that have a number associated with them as multiple items.

2. Consideration for quantities: The prompt should clearly imply or state that if a certain quantity is provided for an item (like 'three bananas'), the model should respectfully consider that quantity while counting the total items.

3. Guideline for understanding: Make clear in the prompt that the model should interpret multiple instances of an item as distinct counts. 

A revised prompt could be:
"Analyze the list, take into account the quantities specified for some items, and accurately count the total number of items."

<1> 
In the question, there are a total of seven animals mentioned: three donkeys, a fish, a cat, a snail, and a mouse. However, the model incorrectly identified six animals. The potential cause for this error might stem from the model's inability to correctly interpret the plural form of 'donkeys' - the model may not have understood that 'three donkeys' indicates three separate animals, thus undercounting the total.

<2> 
In this case, the total number of vegetables is seven, which includes an onion, a garlic, a potato, a yam, a cauliflower, and two cabbages. Similarly to the first example, the model seems to have a problem in recognizing the number 'two' preceding 'cabbages'. It seems to have counted 'two cabbages' as one item instead of two, thus resulting in an error in the final count.

Based on these detailed analyses, it's apparent that the language model struggles with correctly identifying and counting items when a numerical quantifier is involved. It does not seem to have trouble identifying singular items, but appears to count groups of items (like 'three donkeys' and 'two cabbages') as a single item.

Improvements to incorporate into the prompt might include being more specific about the task and providing further instructions, such as:

1. "Analyze the list and accurately count the individual specified items, paying careful attention to any numerical qualifiers that may indicate multiple of a single item"
2. "Interpret the list contextually, keeping in mind that numerical adjectives preceding a noun indicate the number of items present"
3. "Analyze the list and accurately count the specified items, considering items which are quantified with a number as multiple distinct items" 

These instructions encourage the model to pay careful attention to numerical qualifiers and context in a manner that may help correct the observed issue.

I have an onion, a garlic, a potato, a yam, a cauliflower, and two cabbages. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have 6 vegetables.

The correct label is: 7
The model's prediction is: 6.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the question, there are a total of seven animals mentioned: three donkeys, a fish, a cat, a snail, and a mouse. However, the model incorrectly identified six animals. The potential cause for this error might stem from the model's inability to correctly interpret the plural form of 'donkeys' - the model may not have understood that 'three donkeys' indicates three separate animals, thus undercounting the total.

<2> 
In this case, the total number of vegetables is seven, which includes an onion, a garlic, a potato, a yam, a cauliflower, and two cabbages. Similarly to the first example, the model seems to have a problem in recognizing the number 'two' preceding 'cabbages'. It seems to have counted 'two cabbages' as one item instead of two, thus resulting in an error in the final count.

Based on these detailed analyses, it's apparent that the language model struggles with correctly identifying and counting items when a numerical quantifier is involved. It does not seem to have trouble identifying singular items, but appears to count groups of items (like 'three donkeys' and 'two cabbages') as a single item.

Improvements to incorporate into the prompt might include being more specific about the task and providing further instructions, such as:

1. "Analyze the list and accurately count the individual specified items, paying careful attention to any numerical qualifiers that may indicate multiple of a single item"
2. "Interpret the list contextually, keeping in mind that numerical adjectives preceding a noun indicate the number of items present"
3. "Analyze the list and accurately count the specified items, considering items which are quantified with a number as multiple distinct items" 

These instructions encourage the model to pay careful attention to numerical qualifiers and context in a manner that may help correct the observed issue.

gradient:
<1> In the first wrong example, the model misinterprets the counting of the single items and those specified with numerical quantities. It skipped counting the items that don't have a numerical quantity explicitly mentioned before them. 

<2> The issue from the first example repeated here - the model didn't count items given individually ("a fridge", "a chair", "a toaster", "a table", "a microwave"), it only counted those with explicit numerical quantities ("three ovens").

<3> In this example, there is confusion around the category specification. The model started counting all the mentioned items rather than just focusing on the fruits. The problem stems from the task not being sufficiently clear about differentiating between different categories of items and focusing only on the relevant ones.

Improvements for the prompt:
- The prompt could specify that items, even if not marked with a number, should be counted as one item. This could solve the misunderstanding regarding individual items.
- The instruction should underline the importance of identifying and categorizing items properly before making any numerical calculation.
- The language model should be instructed to acknowledge an individual object as 'one' object when there is no number mentioned. "Analyze the list considering the numerical quantities associated with each item, as well as understand that an item without an explicit quantity is one unit of that item, then accurately compute and provide the total count of the specified category."
- Introduce differentiation for categories. So, if the query asks for a certain category, the model should be programmed to filter the required category first before computing the total count.

<1> 
The model's input has been misunderstood by the AI: The task for the model was to count the number of objects in the example. However, it seems the model may have misinterpreted the instructions and only took into account items that were specifically quantified (i.e., three chairs, two tables) and did not consider the objects mentioned without a specific number (i.e., The car, lamp, stove, couch, toaster). 

Reasons for the error:
1. The instructions in the prompt are complicated: The prompt asks the AI to "analyze the list considering the numerical quantities associated with each item" which may lead the AI to focus primarily on the items with the quantities expressly marked and overlook items listed individually.
2. Vagueness in the term "specified category": As the prompt uses the term "specified category," it could be causing confusion as the category isn't clearly defined in this case. The AI might have interpreted 'category' as the objects that were quantified and therefore did not count singularly listed objects.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Simplify language: The language in the prompt could be simplified to clearly instruct the AI to count all items mentioned in the input.
2. Define "category" : To avoid confusion, the term 'category' should be clearly defined or replaced with a term such as 'object' to make sure each item, whether or not it is associated with a numerical quantity, is considered.
3. Creative a directive: Consider incorporating a directive that both singular items and items with numerical quantities must be counted in the total. 

An example of a revised prompt could be: "Analyze each object in the input, count the number of each object accurately, including those with and without expressed quantities, and provide the sum total of all objects."

Wrong Answer: You have a total of 9 animals: 2 nectarines, 5 mice, 1 fish, 1 donkey, 1 duck, 3 pigs, 1 blackberry, 1 rabbit, and 2 chickens.

Reason: The model failed to correctly identify 'animals' as the specified category. For some reason, it considers "nectarines" and "blackberry" as animals, which is incorrect. They are fruits, not animals. This misidentification greatly influenced the total count of the animals.

Question: I have a violin, an oven, a drum, a chair, a bed, a trumpet, a clarinet, a piano, five accordions, a trombone, and a flute. How many musical instruments do I have?

Wrong Answer: There are a total of 11 musical instruments in the list. 

Reason: The model failed to consider "oven", "chair", and "bed" as non-musical items. This mistake didn't impact the counting of musical instruments directly, but shows a problem with the model's categorization capability. The error in the total count, however, is due to it not counting the violin, illustrating its inability to accurately tally numerical quantities associated with items in the list.

gradient:
<1> 

In this example, the model's interpretation of the prompt seems to be woefully incorrect. It treats each discrete variety of fruit as a separate "object." It incorrectly counts individual cases of multiple fruits (like two strawberries or two blackberries) as a singular item and then counts these singular items to get a total of 9, which is mathematically incorrect.

Reasons for the incorrect analysis could be:

- The model might be confusing between "types" and "quantity." It is counting the types of fruits instead of the actual quantity asked for.

- The phrase "quantity of each object" might be leading the model to consider each type of fruit as a singular object, disregarding the exact quantity mentioned.

<2> 

In the second example, the model's response is correct, but the model's prediction is wrong because it predicts only one fruit, even though it correctly identified and listed five fruits in its answer.

Reasons for the incorrect analysis could be:

- There is a discrepancy between the model's itemizing of different fruits and its final prediction. It means there is something wrong with the model's summation or prediction logic.

- The model may not be correctly interpreting the meaning of "total." It can correctly list and identify each individual item, but it fails to provide the cumulative number accurately.

Based on the errors in these examples, here are some potential improvements for the prompt:

1. Specify clearly in the prompt that the model needs to consider each instance of an item in the list, not just unique items or types of items.

2. Clarify the meaning of "total" — that it refers to the summed quantity of all items, not just the number of unique items or types.

3. The prompt should ensure the model understands the difference between counting unique items types (like kinds of fruit) and counting individual instances of items (like five apples).

4. Use simpler and more straightforward instructions, such as "Calculate the exact number of times each item is mentioned in the list, and then provide the total count of all the items."

5. Make sure the prompt makes it clear that numbers mentioned before items should be taken into account in the final tally.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Examine every item in the list, whether quantified or not. Accurately count the quantity of each object and then provide the total number of all the objects combined.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Examine every item in the list, whether quantified or not. Accurately count the quantity of each object and then provide the total number of all the objects combined.
I have two clarinets, a raspberry, two blackberries, an apple, a plum, two oranges, a peach, a violin, a grape, two strawberries, a banana, and a nectarine. How many fruits do I have?


The model's response is: 
There are a total of 9 fruits in the list:
- 1 raspberry
- 2 blackberries
- 1 apple
- 1 plum
- 2 oranges
- 1 peach
- 1 grape
- 2 strawberries
- 1 banana
- 1 nectarine

The correct label is: 13
The model's prediction is: 1.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Examine every item in the list, whether quantified or not. Accurately count the quantity of each object and then provide the total number of all the objects combined.
I have a blackberry, an orange, a peach, an apple, and a strawberry. How many fruits do I have?


The model's response is: 
There are 5 fruits in total. 
- 1 blackberry
- 1 orange
- 1 peach
- 1 apple
- 1 strawberry

The correct label is: 5
The model's prediction is: 1.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

In this example, the model's interpretation of the prompt seems to be woefully incorrect. It treats each discrete variety of fruit as a separate "object." It incorrectly counts individual cases of multiple fruits (like two strawberries or two blackberries) as a singular item and then counts these singular items to get a total of 9, which is mathematically incorrect.

Reasons for the incorrect analysis could be:

- The model might be confusing between "types" and "quantity." It is counting the types of fruits instead of the actual quantity asked for.

- The phrase "quantity of each object" might be leading the model to consider each type of fruit as a singular object, disregarding the exact quantity mentioned.

<2> 

In the second example, the model's response is correct, but the model's prediction is wrong because it predicts only one fruit, even though it correctly identified and listed five fruits in its answer.

Reasons for the incorrect analysis could be:

- There is a discrepancy between the model's itemizing of different fruits and its final prediction. It means there is something wrong with the model's summation or prediction logic.

- The model may not be correctly interpreting the meaning of "total." It can correctly list and identify each individual item, but it fails to provide the cumulative number accurately.

<1> In this example, the model seemed to misunderstand the input. The prompt was accurate and specific, yet the model made an error in its classification. It's not clear why the model predicted '2' when it correctly identified 5 items in the list. This might suggest the model does not always use the information it generated (a list of vegetables) to produce the answer. 

<2> In this instance, the model incorrectly counted non-instrument objects (i.e., the nectarines, bananas, and strawberries) as musical instruments. The error here appears to be with classifying which objects in the list qualified as musical instruments, not with the counting itself. 

<3> This response by the model was correct despite stating the prediction as '2'. This discrepancy is puzzling as the model clearly understands the task and performs it correctly, yet it gets the final number prediction wrong. 

Based on these examples, the following improvement factors come to mind:

- A need to improve the model's classification skills: The model needs to categorize items accurately based on the context, such as discerning a musical instrument from a fruit.

- Ensure the model uses its own generated information: The model correctly recognized and counted objects in example one but still arrived at the wrong final count. 

- Clearer definitions in the prompt: While the prompt seemed clear, it might help to explicitly mention that the categories (like 'musical instruments') help determine what the model should include in the count.

- Debug model output: There seems to be an anomaly between the model's correct listing/identification of items and the incorrect numerical prediction it makes in some instances. 

- Enhanced comprehension capabilities: Although the prompts are clear, some errors indicate a lack of understanding of indirect categorization (e.g., not counting fruits as objects).

<1> Analysis: 
This example is misunderstood by the model because there is a confusion between the number of item types and the total individual count. The prompt instructs the model to "count the quantity of each object," and this might be interpreted as count the types of objects, leading to an incorrect answer. 

<2> Analysis: 
Similar to the first example, the model seems to misunderstand the distinction between the types of items and the individual count of each item. The interaction between "counting each object" and providing "the total number of all the objects combined" could have been confusing for the model.

<3> Analysis:  
In this case, the model counts each type of animals mentioned but adds them incorrectly. The complexity of the task seems to have compromised the model's counting ability, leading to a mathematical error. 

Improvements: 

1. Need to clarify the difference between types of items and total individual items – The prompt should be designed so that the distinction between counting types of items and counting individual items is clear.

2. Specify the task more explicitly – The instruction should unequivocally instruct the model to count each individual item, regardless of whether it's of the same type or not.

3. Simplicity – The prompt should be designed in a simple way that doesn't overwhelm the model with too much information. It should guide the model to focus on the most important task: counting individual items.

4. Double-check calculations – The prompt can include a direction prompting the model to verify its calculations for accuracy. 

Therefore, a revised prompt might be:
"Count each individual item in the list, regardless of whether they are the same type or not. Confirm the accuracy of your calculations. Then, provide the total number of items or objects."

Question: I have a lamp, a microwave, a table, a fridge, a stove, four beds, a toaster, an oven, two couches, and a chair. How many objects do I have?

Incorrect Answer: You have a total of 13 objects.

Analysis:
The error occurs because the model incorrectly counted the number of 'beds'. The context mentioned 'four beds', but the model only counted it as one instance, therefore under-counting the total number of objects. The prompt does ask the model to consider numbers mentioned before items, but it appears the model didn't fully comprehend this part of the prompt.

<2>
Question: I have three mice, a bear, a frog, a fish, a donkey, a duck, a pig, a rabbit, a goat, and a snake. How many animals do I have? 

Incorrect Answer: You have a total of 11 animals.

Analysis:
Just like in example 1, the error occurs because the model made a mistake in counting 'mice'. The input mentioned 'three mice', however, the model counted this as one on its total tally. The error indicates an issue with the model's comprehension of the existing prompt. 

From the aforementioned issues, we can derive the following set of ideas to improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize Counting Multiple Instances: The need to count mentioned numbers before items can be emphasized more in the prompt. By explicitly stating that items might occur multiple times, the model can be better informed to look for numerical descriptors associated with items.

2. Add Specific Examples: The task could be further clarified through an example. The example should cover a case where a listed quantity impacts the total count, reinforcing the need to consider numbers mentioned before items.

3. Separation of Item Identification and Count: The model may benefit from having two distinct steps in the prompt - first identifying unique items and their quantities and second, performing the final tally.
   
Improved Prompt: Examine each item mentioned in the list. Consider that some items might have a number associated with them, indicating their frequency. It's crucial to consider the individual count of each item, even when the same item is mentioned multiple times. As a simple example: for "two cats and a dog", the summation would be 3, not 2. Now, calculate the total sum of all the individual instances of each item.

I have three mice, a bear, a frog, a fish, a donkey, a duck, a pig, a rabbit, a goat, and a snake. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
3 mice + 1 bear + 1 frog + 1 fish + 1 donkey + 1 duck + 1 pig + 1 rabbit + 1 goat + 1 snake = 11 animals

Therefore, you have a total of 11 animals.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Question: I have a lamp, a microwave, a table, a fridge, a stove, four beds, a toaster, an oven, two couches, and a chair. How many objects do I have?

Incorrect Answer: You have a total of 13 objects.

Analysis:
The error occurs because the model incorrectly counted the number of 'beds'. The context mentioned 'four beds', but the model only counted it as one instance, therefore under-counting the total number of objects. The prompt does ask the model to consider numbers mentioned before items, but it appears the model didn't fully comprehend this part of the prompt.

<2>
Question: I have three mice, a bear, a frog, a fish, a donkey, a duck, a pig, a rabbit, a goat, and a snake. How many animals do I have? 

Incorrect Answer: You have a total of 11 animals.

Analysis:
Just like in example 1, the error occurs because the model made a mistake in counting 'mice'. The input mentioned 'three mice', however, the model counted this as one on its total tally. The error indicates an issue with the model's comprehension of the existing prompt. 

From the aforementioned issues, we can derive the following set of ideas to improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize Counting Multiple Instances: The need to count mentioned numbers before items can be emphasized more in the prompt. By explicitly stating that items might occur multiple times, the model can be better informed to look for numerical descriptors associated with items.

2. Add Specific Examples: The task could be further clarified through an example. The example should cover a case where a listed quantity impacts the total count, reinforcing the need to consider numbers mentioned before items.

3. Separation of Item Identification and Count: The model may benefit from having two distinct steps in the prompt - first identifying unique items and their quantities and second, performing the final tally.
   
Improved Prompt: Examine each item mentioned in the list. Consider that some items might have a number associated with them, indicating their frequency. It's crucial to consider the individual count of each item, even when the same item is mentioned multiple times. As a simple example: for "two cats and a dog", the summation would be 3, not 2. Now, calculate the total sum of all the individual instances of each item.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the list and accurately count the specified items
(2) Analyze the list considering the numerical quantities associated with each item, then accurately compute and provide the total count of the specified category.
(3) Examine every item in the list, whether quantified or not. Accurately count the quantity of each object and then provide the total number of all the objects combined.
(4) Looking at each item listed, including those with multiple quantities, calculate the exact number of individual instances of each specified item. Remember to consider numbers mentioned before items. Then, accurately provide the total sum of all the individual instances.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

Question Details: The question asks for a count of all individual fruit items specified. 

Model Response: The model correctly identified the counts of each individual fruit and summed them to give the correct answer as 5. However, the model's prediction was incorrectly stated as 1.

Possible Reason for Error: This result may not necessarily be a reflection of the prompt but possibly a technical or computing error. The model seems to have understood the prompt properly and given a correct response but the prediction was incorrect. 

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:

Question Details: The question provides a mixed list of items including some animals with varying quantities and asks for a total count of the animals only.

Model Response: The model identifies all the animals correctly, adds counts of most of them correctly, but misses out on counting one of the frogs.

Possible Reason for Error: This error could be due to an oversight on the part of the model in not correctly identifying that the quantity "two" preceding "frogs" indicates there are two instances of the item. This indicates that the model may struggle to accurately count items with explicit quantities mentioned.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarification: Include more specific guidance in the prompt about the importance of correctly counting the instances when quantities are given before the items. This could help avoid miscounts like with the frog instances in the second question.
   
2. Specification: Given the error in the first example, the prompt could be more specific by stating that the model should not only provide the total count but also its prediction accurately. It could also specify that the model checks if the total count in its response matches its prediction.

3. Scope Definition: The prompt could define the scope of the task better by specifying the model to only consider mentioned quantities and not assume any hidden quantities or categories of items. It could be amended to state that the model only needs to calculate total counts based on explicit numerical information provided. 

4. Examples: Provide examples within the prompt to make it clearer how the model should handle specific situations such as when quantities are explicitly mentioned. 

5. Validation: The prompt can ask the model to double-check its answers and ensure it is accurate. This may prevent errors from oversight. 

6. Limitations: The prompt must clarify that when an item appears more than once, each mention should be treated as an individual instance.

<1> 
In this example, the model made an error in identifying all the animals. While the prompt asked to calculate instances of each item, the model didn't consider 'snakes' as a single item with multiple instances but treated it as a single entity. This led to undercounting the total number of animals present. 

<2> 
In this case, the model's response is completely correct. However, it made prediction 1 instead of the correct label 2. Perhaps the instructions in the prompt were misinterpreted by the model, causing it to err in counting.

<3> 
For this example, the error in the model’s prediction might have occurred for the same reason as the first example. The model might have considered 'drums' as a singular item, rather than treating it as an item with multiple instances. The model didn't understand to include each item, not just the types of items, which led to an incorrect total count of musical instruments.

To improve the prompt, we could:
1. Emphasize "count each occurrence of every item, even if they belong to the same category," to ensure that the model doesn't skip counting multiple instances of the same item as different entities.
2. Alternatively, we can specify to "consider singular and plural items as separate entities. For example, treat '1 cat' and 'four snakes' as different, contributing to the total count as 1+4 = 5".
3. Make the language less verbose to minimize confusion. For example, "Calculate the total number of each item and then provide the sum of these numbers."
4. Instead of using the rather vague 'instances', be more specific by asking the model to 'count each individual item'. This might help avoid confusion around grouped items like 'four snakes'. 

By addressing these issues it would help the model improve the counting, especially for grouped items, and reduce misinterpretation.

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis: 

The prompt asks the model to count each object 'regardless of its quantity.' However, in the given example, the carrots are counted as one object, even though there are three. The phrase 'regardless of its quantity' likely misled the model, making it count the total types of vegetables rather than the total number of individual vegetables.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis

In the second example, the same issue applies. The model correctly identifies all the fruit but it miscounts them when there are multiple of the same type of fruit. Again, the model is interpreting ‘count each object regardless of its quantity’ as to count the types of fruit, not the total number of fruits.

Improvements Respective to the Identified Issues:
- Remove the phrase about counting each object 'regardless of its quantity.’
- Clearly instruct the model to count each individual occurrence or repetition of each object, not the types of objects.
- Make distinction between 'objects' and 'types of objects' clearer.
- Specify the importance of quantity while making the count in the new prompt.
- Highlight the significance of context in understanding and classifying the items.

Improved Prompt: 

Review each mentioned item from the list, ensuring you're aware of the context in which they're presented. Each individual occurrence or repetition of an object should be counted, not just the types of objects. If objects fall under specified categories, focus your counting on that category. Should objects be classified under different categories, separate and count them as per their respective categories. Always use these recognized details when generating the final count.

gradient:
<1>
In this case, the model's error is due to misunderstanding the quantity. While the model correctly lists all the fruits, it miscounts the raspberries. It recognizes the three raspberries as one item, leading to one less overall count. The prompt should have stressed on recognizing plurality and considering multiple items as separate entities, not as one. 

<2>
Similar to the first example, the model has failed to recognize plurality in the grapes and bananas. Although the prompt mentioned to count each object regardless of its quantity, it didn't place enough emphasis on counting repeated items separately. Hence, the model views four grapes as one fruit, and two bananas as one piece of fruit.

<3>
Once again, the model makes an error in counting the oranges. This repetition of mistakes across several examples indicates that the model has a conceptual misunderstanding. This blunder occurs despite the prompt stating explicitly to count each object, indicating that the model struggles with understanding plurality.

<4>
With this example, the model seems to fail handling categorization. Even though the prompt describes separating items according to their categories, the model does not generate the count correctly. It miscategorizes the items, attributing a score of 1 instead of 3. Here, the model's issue is not about plurality but its more fundamental understanding of categories and integer counting.


To summarize from these examples, the improvements needed for the prompt are:

1. Improve clarity: Add more details on counting multiple instances of a single item indicated as a plural or specified quantity rather than treating them as one.
2. Definition of Object: Encourage the model to understand each item as a unique countable entity, especially when a number in front of an object indicates its quantity.
3. Emphasize importance of categories: The prompt must stress the fact that every object classified under a certain category must be counted towards the final total, irrespective of the quantity of each item.
4. Strengthen numerical understanding: The model should be informed to accurately count the items mentioned in each category, focusing on numerical listing as well. 
5. Explicit Instruction: Clearly instruct the model to give an accurate total count after evaluating all categories, quantities and items mentioned.

Examining the first wrong example:

<1> 
Input: 
I have a dog, a stalk of celery, two heads of broccoli, a mouse, a yam, three cabbages, an onion, two garlics, a cauliflower, a carrot, a lettuce head, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?

Model's wrong response: 
Vegetables:
- Stalk of celery
- Two heads of broccoli
- Three cabbages
- An onion
- Two garlics
- A cauliflower
- A carrot
- A lettuce head
- A potato

Total vegetables: 12

Correct label: 14
Model's prediction: 12

Step by Step Analysis:

1. The prompt instructs the model to "Count each object regardless of its quantity", but it seems like the model has not correctly interpreted this instruction. It counted a stalk of celery, two heads of broccoli and two garlics as individual objects, rather than taking their quantity into account.

2. The model seems to follow the line "Distinguish objects based on their categories as portrayed in the context". It correctly identifies and categorizes vegetables from non-vegetables but is unable to apply the rule of counting accurately.

Reasons for the Wrong Answer:

1. Ambiguous Instructions: The phrase "Count each object regardless of its quantity" can be interpreted as asking the model to count each type of object once, regardless of how many of the object there are. This seems to be the interpretation the model has chosen, leading to the wrong answer.

2. Misunderstanding of Quantity: The model does not seem to clearly understand what is meant by "quantity". Instead of counting the individual units of each type of vegetable, it interprets the quantity as a singular entity.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clear Instructions: The prompt must include more clear instructions about counting individual units within each category of objects. For example, "Count each individual unit within its respective category, rather than considering each type of object as a singular entity."

2. Emphasis on Quantity: The new prompt should emphasize the importance of quantity and the model should be instructed on the difference between quantity (the number of individual units) and variety (the number of different types). For example, "Give weight to the quantity of each object, meaning, each stalk, each head, and each piece should be counted independently."

3. Pasting the query in the prompt: The question that is being asked should be used in the prompt. If the question is "How many vegetables do I have", that question should be emphasized in the text to be ascertained so the model knows exactly what to look into.

4. Redefining Object: Define 'object' in this context as an individual unit or piece, and not as a type or category of item.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully review every item mentioned in the list. Distinguish objects based on their categories as portrayed in the context. Count each object regardless of its quantity, focusing on the certain category if specified, then provide the total accurate count. If the objects are classified under different categories, separate them accordingly. Ensure to utilize the identified information when generating the final count.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Carefully review every item mentioned in the list. Distinguish objects based on their categories as portrayed in the context. Count each object regardless of its quantity, focusing on the certain category if specified, then provide the total accurate count. If the objects are classified under different categories, separate them accordingly. Ensure to utilize the identified information when generating the final count.
I have a dog, a stalk of celery, two heads of broccoli, a mouse, a yam, three cabbages, an onion, two garlics, a cauliflower, a carrot, a lettuce head, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?


The model's response is: 
Vegetables:
- Stalk of celery
- Two heads of broccoli
- Three cabbages
- An onion
- Two garlics
- A cauliflower
- A carrot
- A lettuce head
- A potato

Total vegetables: 12

The correct label is: 14
The model's prediction is: 12.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Examining the first wrong example:

<1> 
Input: 
I have a dog, a stalk of celery, two heads of broccoli, a mouse, a yam, three cabbages, an onion, two garlics, a cauliflower, a carrot, a lettuce head, and a potato. How many vegetables do I have?

Model's wrong response: 
Vegetables:
- Stalk of celery
- Two heads of broccoli
- Three cabbages
- An onion
- Two garlics
- A cauliflower
- A carrot
- A lettuce head
- A potato

Total vegetables: 12

Correct label: 14
Model's prediction: 12

Step by Step Analysis:

1. The prompt instructs the model to "Count each object regardless of its quantity", but it seems like the model has not correctly interpreted this instruction. It counted a stalk of celery, two heads of broccoli and two garlics as individual objects, rather than taking their quantity into account.

2. The model seems to follow the line "Distinguish objects based on their categories as portrayed in the context". It correctly identifies and categorizes vegetables from non-vegetables but is unable to apply the rule of counting accurately.

Reasons for the Wrong Answer:

1. Ambiguous Instructions: The phrase "Count each object regardless of its quantity" can be interpreted as asking the model to count each type of object once, regardless of how many of the object there are. This seems to be the interpretation the model has chosen, leading to the wrong answer.

2. Misunderstanding of Quantity: The model does not seem to clearly understand what is meant by "quantity". Instead of counting the individual units of each type of vegetable, it interprets the quantity as a singular entity.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clear Instructions: The prompt must include more clear instructions about counting individual units within each category of objects. For example, "Count each individual unit within its respective category, rather than considering each type of object as a singular entity."

2. Emphasis on Quantity: The new prompt should emphasize the importance of quantity and the model should be instructed on the difference between quantity (the number of individual units) and variety (the number of different types). For example, "Give weight to the quantity of each object, meaning, each stalk, each head, and each piece should be counted independently."

3. Pasting the query in the prompt: The question that is being asked should be used in the prompt. If the question is "How many vegetables do I have", that question should be emphasized in the text to be ascertained so the model knows exactly what to look into.

4. Redefining Object: Define 'object' in this context as an individual unit or piece, and not as a type or category of item.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the list and accurately count the specified items
(2) Analyze the list considering the numerical quantities associated with each item, then accurately compute and provide the total count of the specified category.
(3) Examine every item in the list, whether quantified or not. Accurately count the quantity of each object and then provide the total number of all the objects combined.
(4) Carefully review every item mentioned in the list. Distinguish objects based on their categories as portrayed in the context. Count each object regardless of its quantity, focusing on the certain category if specified, then provide the total accurate count. If the objects are classified under different categories, separate them accordingly. Ensure to utilize the identified information when generating the final count.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Examine each item mentioned in the list, taking note of the specific category it belongs to as described in the context. When counting, consider every individual unit within each defined category, not just the type or variety of the object. Quantities attached to the objects must be given proper weight during counting. For example, two heads of broccoli should count as two vegetables. Whilst focusing on a specific category if mentioned, provide the total count incorporating each unit's quantity. If objects belong to different categories, tally those according to their categories. The question about the count should be a crucial source of instruction - use it wisely while processing the quantity. An object in this matter refers to individual pieces or units within a type or category of an object. <END>

   prompt: Classify the provided items according to their categories, identify their individual significance within the context, and calculate the total of every item specified. Ensure you count each individual item, regardless of whether there are multiples of the same type, and not just unique item types. Add together the quantities stated for each, as the total should reflect the sum of all individual units, not the sum of categories or types. Always interpret items with the same count as individual units in one category, not as different species. Dedicate careful attention to context clues when determining the significance of each "item".

   prompt: Please classify the specified items according to their categories, and identify their individual roles within the context. Pay close attention to any language that indicates quantity (such as 'two couches' or 'four cauliflowers') and ensure that you count these as individual units – not as one single item. Calculate and provide the total number of every item mentioned, taking into account the quantities specified for each. The total should be the sum of all individual units, not simply a count of unique item types or categories. Treat items with the same count as individual units within one category, not as different species. Remember, items with multiple counts are calculated as separate entities in their respective categories. Compile these findings and, with the utmost precision, deduce the total number of items, including every instance of each individual item, not merely the variety of items.

   prompt: Analyze the list of items mentioned in the given context. Arrange these items into their related categories based on their nature and significance. Whenever a category is requested for counting, consider all unique types of items within that category. Remember that each unique type of item might be represented multiple times with a number specifying its quantity. Do not ignore these numbers or interpret them as "one." Each instance of an item should be accounted for in the total count irrespective of its repetition in the list. Calculate the count by considering both the variety of the types and the quantities of each type within the requested category. The predicted answer should be an accurate count reflecting the precise quantities assigned to each type of item within their respective category. This necessitates clear differentiation between singular and plurality in listings, and understanding that words like 'two', 'three', etc., before an item mean more than one of that item. Consider the following example: 'I have two apples, a carrot, and three oranges. How many fruits do I have?' , the correct answer should be five, counting two apples and three oranges.

   prompt: Interpret the given input, determine the categories related to the items, and identify each item's significance based on its context. When enumerating each item, be aware even if a type of item is listed multiple times, you should treat it as one and consider the quantities mentioned next to them. If a quantity is indicated along with an item, it should be multiplied by the count of that item type. The final count should consider the exact quantities of each item, where each item refers to the total quantity of each type of object, not just the item category. In questions asking for quantities like "how many vegetables do I have?", give the total quantity of individual items in the category, rather than the different types of items present.

   prompt: When presented with a list of items, it is crucial to count the total number of each item, including the quantities described for each one. Bear in mind that each type of item may have a specified number, which represents the actual quantity of the item -- do not count this as a single item. For example, if three apples are mentioned, count it as three separate items (apples) rather than one type of item (apple). Strictly adhere to the rule of counting the quantities mentioned in the input, regardless of the category or context of the items. Your final output should provide the accurate total count of each kind of item mentioned in the specificity.

   prompt: Please classify the specified items according to their categories, and identify their individual roles within the context. Pay close attention to any language that indicates quantity (such as 'two couches' or 'four cauliflowers') and ensure that you count these as individual units – not as one single item. Calculate and provide the total number of every item mentioned, taking into account the quantities specified for each. The total should be the sum of all individual units, not simply a count of unique item types or categories. Treat items with the same count as individual units within one category, not as different species. Remember, items with multiple counts are calculated as separate entities in their respective categories. Compile these findings and, with the utmost precision, deduce the total number of items, including every instance of each individual item, not merely the variety of items.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the quantity of each item mentioned in the provided information. Both single items and multiples of the same items must be noted as separate units when counting the total. Do not group multiples of the same item into one count; each is its own unit. Perform the task by classifying the items into their categories, if necessary, but ensure that the total reflects the sum of all individual items and not the sum of categories or types. Do not differentiate items of the same type as different species. Use the context clues for understanding the nature and significance of each item, making sure to maintain focus on the total count. For example, if the input is "I have three goats and two sheep", your response should be "You have 5 animals in total", and not "You have 2 types of animals".

   prompt: Based on the provided context, classify items into suitable categories and calculate the total count of all items. Pay extra attention to the quantities stated for each item and make a careful note of multiples. Remember, the total should be a sum of all individual units, even if they are multiples of the same kind. Your goal is to identify the total count of individual items rather than unique types or categories. Consider every item with a similar count as individual units within a category. Apply this method even when distinguishing between items of the same species. Make certain to heed context clues in order to correctly assess the significance of each item.

   prompt: Evaluate each element in the list given, acknowledging those with assigned quantities as well as those without explicit quantities mentioned. Accurately calculate the number of individual instances for each listed item, ensuring specifically to count every instance where numbers precede items. Subsequently, provide a comprehensive total sum of all individual instances. Make sure to correctly evaluate and state your final prediction. Use the quantities provided explicitly and do not infer any hidden quantities or categories. For items that appear multiple times, treat each appearance as a separate instance. For example, if two frogs are mentioned in the list, it should be counted as two separate instances of frogs, not one. Please double-check your counts for accuracy before providing the final prediction.

   prompt: Thoroughly examine each item mentioned in the list, taking into account the context in which they're presented. Count every individual instance of an object regardless of how many times it is listed. Particularly observe if objects fall under specific categories; in this case, intensify your focus on that category for counting. In circumstances where objects are divided under diverse categories, isolate and tally them according to their relevant categories. Remember to account for numerical quantities associated with each item, as they are pertinent for calculating the total accurate count. The information you identify about each object, including its repeated occurrences and categories, is crucial in shaping the final count.

   prompt: Thoroughly examine every item mentioned in the list. Representatives of the same object that appear multiple times, whether as a single, plural entity, or with a specified number, should be counted as individual entities. Categorize objects based on their types as suggested in the context. Produce the total count for each category, considering the quantity of each object if specified. If objects fall under different categories, separate and count them according to their specific classifications. After taking into account all detail levels such as categories, specific quantities and items' repetitions, provide the complete and exact final count.

   prompt: Examine each item mentioned in the list, taking note of the specific category it belongs to as described in the context. When counting, consider every individual unit within each defined category, not just the type or variety of the object. Quantities attached to the objects must be given proper weight during counting. For example, two heads of broccoli should count as two vegetables. Whilst focusing on a specific category if mentioned, provide the total count incorporating each unit's quantity. If objects belong to different categories, tally those according to their categories. The question about the count should be a crucial source of instruction - use it wisely while processing the quantity. An object in this matter refers to individual pieces or units within a type or category of an object.
