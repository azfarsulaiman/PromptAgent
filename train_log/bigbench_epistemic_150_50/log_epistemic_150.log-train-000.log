I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava thinks that Thomas thinks that the Sooner football player carrying the ball is trying to avoid being tackled. Hypothesis: Thomas thinks that the Sooner football player carrying the ball is trying to avoid being tackled.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava assumes that Charles believes that a woman is applying lip makeup to another woman who seems to have some green in her hair. Hypothesis: Charles believes that a woman is applying lip makeup to another woman who seems to have some green in her hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
1. The question is about the relationship between two statements, asking the model to determine if there's 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' However, the prompt doesn't provide a clear definition or context for 'entailment' or 'non-entailment,' which probably misleads the model.
2. The task requires high-level understanding of reasoning and human psychology, the current language model might not fully understand that Ava's thoughts about Thomas's thoughts does not necessarily mean those are Thomas's true thoughts.
   
Example 2:
1. Again, the language model misinterpreted 'entailment' and 'non-entailment.' It seems to be interpreting these terms as simple causality or direct implication rather than understanding the nuanced inferences.
2. The model also seemed to fail in understanding the difference between an assumption and a fact. Just because Ava assumes something about Charles does not make it a reality for Charles.

Based on the issues found from the two examples, the following improvements can be made:
1. Define or provide examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt so that the model clearly understands what it's supposed to identify.
2. Make it clear in the prompt that the task requires understanding of third-party perspectives. The model should not assume the thoughts and beliefs attributed to a third party by someone are indeed that third-party's thoughts and beliefs.
3. Possibly incorporate a prompt that encourages the model to differentiate between assumptions and reality or facts.
4. Include more context or information that can guide the model's reasoning and decision-making process better.

gradient:
For example <1>, the issues with the prompt include:

- The prompt asks for "causal attribution," but the question requires logical reasoning and ability to identify linguistic entailment, which are not the same things. This could be why the model predicted a non-entailment. It might not understand that a man "dressed only in a towel" in a sauna could logically entail a "human not wearing any clothes" in a room. 

- The prompt also does not provide clear instructions about how to reason about entailment (i.e., establish the implication or logical correlation between premise and hypothesis). Without a clear directive, the language model might struggle to make correct inferences.

For example <2>, the issues are similar:

- Again, the prompt requests "causal attribution" when the question requires understanding and application of the concept of entailment. The model might fail to identify that the premise and hypothesis are identical and hence entail each other. 

- The prompt does not sufficiently instruct the model on the entailment concept or how to apply it to understand the linguistic relations of these sentences.

In both examples, the model is asked to do a different task than what the prompt requests, which results in incorrect answers.

Prompt Improvements:

1. Change the prompt request from "causal attribution" to logical inference or entailment, depending upon the task of analyzing relations between sentences.

2. Provide instructions about entailment, specifying that it involves determining whether the premise logically implies or contradicts the hypothesis.

3. Specify that if the premise and the hypothesis are identical, the relation is always entailment.

4. It could also be helpful to add examples of entailment and non-entailment in the prompt as reference.

5. Request the model to consider the semantic correlation between sentences.

By revising these directions, the model will be better placed to correctly perform the entailment tasks.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

In this example, the model fails to correctly determine the 'entailment' relationship even though there is clear parity between the premise and the hypothesis. This is not a matter of the model misunderstanding causal attribution, but rather a task of logical comprehension and entailment recognition, which is not specified in the prompt. The wrong output seems to be a result of misunderstanding the description of the characters involved, rather than failing to connect cause and effect in a situation.

Wrong Example 2: 

Just like the first example, the model fails to recognize the 'entailment' between the given premise and hypothesis. The model is not being instructed to correctly determine a logical relationship between two statements involving the same characters and situations, but is rather tasked with answering questions about causal attribution. This might have caused confusion to the model, leading to the incorrect answer. 

Improvement:

Based on these analyses, it's clear that the prompt 'Answer questions about causal attribution' is not representative of the tasks provided, which are more about assessing logical comprehension or entailment. So, the prompt should reflect the core tasks which are 'logical comprehension' and 'entailment recognition'. Therefore, it can be rewritten as: 

"Assess the logical relationships between premises and hypotheses and identify whether they 'entail' or do not 'entail' each other."

Furthermore, to avoid any ambiguity about the format of the answer, the instructions part in the prompt can clarify this by adding: 

"Provide your answer by choosing from the given options and present your answer between the tags <answer> and </answer>."

gradient:
For Example 1:

The premise and hypothesis are very similar in describing the same situation - a man in a sweatshirt using a power saw. The difference is the descriptor of the man ("a man" vs "the guy"). The model appears to incorrectly interpret this difference in descriptor as a possible different entity, instead of recognizing it as the same entity being referred to. This leads to it classifying the relationship as 'non-entailment' whereas it should be 'entailment'.

For Example 2:

The premise describes a specific scenario in which children are playing in the snow, and the hypothesis generalizes this scenario to children playing in the snow in general. The model seems to incorrectly perceive the specific-to-general inference as a lack of guaranteed truth, therefore classifying it as 'non-entailment'. Yet, the premise of children playing in the snow does indeed entail that children, in general, play in the snow. 

For Example 3:

The premise refers to a tennis player performing a specific action during a game (spiking the ball), and the hypothesis generalizes to the player playing tennis. Similar to Example 2, the model seems to struggle with specific-to-general inference, classifying it as 'non-entailment'. The model should recognize that the premise of a tennis player performing a specific action within the sport inherently suggests that the player is playing tennis. 

Improvements:

1. Clarify the interpretation of different descriptors: The model must understand that slight variations in how an entity is described, like "a man" and "the guy," do not inherently suggest different entities.

2. Improve understanding of specific-to-general inferences: The model should recognize the implicitly general statement in the specific ones .For example, 'children playing in the snow and making a snowball' does imply 'children play in the snow'

3. Include more explicit examples in the prompt: To guide the model more effectively, the prompt could include clear examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' scenarios.

4. Ensure comprehension of implied activities: If a specific action within an activity is mentioned (like spiking the ball in tennis), the larger activity should be recognized as implied (playing tennis).

5. Specify that all characters/events referenced within the premise are assumed to be consistent and continuous into the hypothesis. This helps the model infer that characters/events in the hypothesis are the same as those found in the premise.

Example Analysis:

In example one, the model incorrectly inferred 'non-entailment' over 'entailment'. The problem arises from the composition of the prompt, which seems to highlight assumptions and guesses about another person's thoughts or beliefs and how they do not confirm the second person's actual thoughts or beliefs. However, in this particular example, it has been declared as a factual statement that "Joseph recognizes that John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp." In this scenario, it hasn't been mentioned that it's Joseph's assumption or guess, rather it's portrayed as something Joseph recognizes or knows, which would entail that John indeed thinks that.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Ambiguity in the prompt's language: The phrase "a person’s guess or assumption about what another person thinks or believes does not confirm that the second person indeed holds those thoughts or beliefs" might have given the model an impression that all inferences about someone's thoughts or beliefs should be treated as 'non-entailment'. 

2. Misinterpretation of 'factual statement' and 'assumption': The model seems to treat the recognition of a person towards another's thought as an assumption rather than a fact, which leads to the error.

Improvement suggestions:

1. Provide Contextual Clarity: Make it clear in the prompt that when something is recognized or acknowledged by a person about another person's thoughts, it should be treated as a factual statement rather than an assumption. 

2. Emphasize on the interpretation of premises: The prompt can further elaborate on interpreting premises as facts or assumptions and resolving entailment accordingly. 

3. Avoid Over-generalization: Instead of generalizing all assumptions and guesses, specify that this only includes ambiguous scenarios where the inference about other’s thoughts or beliefs is not explicit. 

Modified prompt: 

Analyze questions about relational inference, with the emphasis on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' signifies that the truth of one statement undoubtedly confirms the truth of another, whereas 'non-entailment' denotes that the truth of one statement does not conclusively prove the truth of another. While considering a person’s guess or assumption about someone else's thoughts or beliefs, keep in mind that such an assumption does not provide confirmation that holds those beliefs or thoughts, unless explicitly stated or acknowledged so. Interpret the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses and select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Consider supplied information as a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Ultimately, present your selected answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

<START> Analyze questions dealing with 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in relational inference. When 'entailment' is considered, it means that the truthfulness of one statement ensures the validity of another; on the other hand, 'non-entailment' denotes that the truth of one statement does not automatically ascertain the truth of another.

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Joseph assumes that man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping.
Options: 
(A) entailment 
(B) non-entailment

Model's response: The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Joseph assuming that a man is jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open does not necessarily mean that he assumes a man is jumping. <answer>[B) non-entailment]</answer>

Correct Label: A

Wrong answer analysis: 
1. Semantic understanding: The model failed to correctly understand that the premise does entail the hypothesis. In the premise, Joseph is assuming a man is jumping - albeit with added detail. This guarantees that he assumes a man is jumping, which is the hypothesis, thus the scenario is one of entailment.
2. Reductionism: This prompt asks the model to deduce a simpler scenario (a man jumping) from a more complex scenario (a man jumping and splitting his legs), but the model failed to reduce the premise correctly.
3. Precision: The decision framework provided by the prompt seems to have led the model to consider unnecessary precision, focusing on the additional details in the premise and overlooking the fact that these details are subsumed within the broader action of 'jumping'.

Improvement aspects:
1. Clarity: Make sure the prompt clearly explains entailment, emphasizing that even if additional details are present in the premise, as long as the basic scenario of the hypothesis is present, it is a case of entailment.
2. Semantic understanding: Improve the model's ability to understand the semantics of a situation, teaching it that a more complex action can entail a simpler one.
3. Simplification: Teach the model about reductionism and guide it towards recognizing simpler actions within more complex ones.
4. Precision: Guide the model to focus more on the broader picture rather than smaller, unnecessary details. For this, the prompt should instruct the model to not over-emphasize details.
5. Explicit instruction: The prompt could be improved by including instructions to consider assumptions inherent in the details of a more specific premise as applicable to a broader hypothesis.

However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example 1, the language model interpreted that Robert's memory of Richard's assumption does not necessarily confirm Richard's assumption. This perspective, while logical in the real world scenario, is at odds with how entailment is evaluated in linguistic inferentialism. Typically, in natural language inference tasks, such elements of personal belief or memory are treated as given fact, unless explicitly proved false within the context. This causes the model to predict non-entailment, while entailment was the correct choice.

In example 2, the model seems to distinguish between Ava's belief about Abigail's understanding and Ava's own beliefs, incorrectly categorizing the situation as non-entailment. This suggests the model's understanding of nested or layered beliefs/assumptions in the premise needs improvement. The model did not recognize that Ava's belief in Abigail's knowledge suggests Ava herself holds that belief, leading to the incorrect choice of non-entailment.

Reasons for the Prompt Leading to Incorrect Answers:
1. The model doesn't treat elements of personal belief or memory as given fact (unless explicitly contradicted). This approach prevents it from accurately identifying entailment in these situations.
2. The model struggles with handling nested or layered beliefs or assumptions, leading to incorrect identification as non-entailment.

Improvement Aspects:
1. The prompt should clarify how to treat elements of personal belief, memory, or assumption during the task, implicitly acknowledging them as fact for the purpose of entailment (unless contradicted). 
2. The prompt should explicitly address how to handle nested beliefs or assumptions. For instance, it should clearly state how 'A believes that B believes X' indicates 'A believes X', unless explicitly contradicted.
3. The prompt could include examples demonstrating entailment and non-entailment, providing the model with context about how these two differ, especially in scenarios involving beliefs, assumptions, or memory.
4. The prompt might address the role of wording and structure in the premise and hypothesis, insisting on careful analysis to determine whether a change in phrasing alters the overall meaning, and thus affects entailment.

3. The prompt could include examples demonstrating entailment and non-entailment, providing the model with context about how these two differ, especially in scenarios involving beliefs, assumptions, or memory.
4. The prompt might address the role of wording and structure in the premise and hypothesis, insisting on careful analysis to determine whether a change in phrasing alters the overall meaning, and thus affects entailment.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze questions about relational inference, focusing particularly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' implies that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not necessarily ensure the truth of another. Consider that a person’s guess or assumption about what another person thinks or believes does not confirm that the second person indeed holds those thoughts or beliefs. Identify the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Treat all information provided as either a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Finally, display your chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Analyze questions dealing with 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in relational inference. When 'entailment' is considered, it means that the truthfulness of one statement ensures the validity of another; on the other hand, 'non-entailment' denotes that the truth of one statement does not automatically ascertain the truth of another. Be mindful that a person’s assumption or guess about the beliefs or thoughts of another person cannot always be equated with the latter's true thoughts or beliefs. Such situations should ideally be treated as 'non-entailment', unless it is explicitly stated or understood that the person's thoughts or beliefs have been recognized or acknowledged. From the provided premises and hypotheses, deduce their relationship and select between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' in accordance to the information given. Handle the given information as either a declaration of fact or an assumption, based on the context. Finally, your selected answer should be presented bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reason for wrong example:

For this particular example, the confusion might arise because of the description of the setting in the premises and the hypothesis. While the premise describes two boys with distinctive shirts, the hypothesis mentions two boys sitting at the desks in a classroom. The model might be interpreting these as distinct scenarios and treating them as 'non-entailment'. It could also misconstrue the details about the boys' clothing as irrelevant when deciding on 'entailment'.

There could be other reasons related to the language of the prompt. The instructions may have been interpreted too strictly, causing the language model to be overly cautious about assumptions. In real-world scenarios and natural language understanding, some level of inference is often required.

Another major reason for the error could be lack of detailed clarity on what should majorly constitute an entailment or non-entailment. The model focuses more on information being identical to establish it as an entailment rather than seeing if the hypothesis can logically be deduced from the premise.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Include some clarification about the need for holistic understanding of the scenario. The model should understand that small deviations in specifics do not necessarily indicate 'non-entailment'.

2. Refine the definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. It should be clear that entailment doesn't require the premise and hypothesis to be identical, but that the latter can be logically inferred from the former.

3. Provide examples that illustrate the nuanced differences between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. This should explain how 'entailment' could apply even in cases where the hypothesis isn't an exact repetition of the premise.

4. Emphasize that the model should reflect human-like understanding of entailment and non-entailment, which may involve some degree of reasonable inference.

5. Highlight that in entailment it could be a scenario described differently or focusing on different aspects of the same scenario, but the core event or subjects involved are the same.

Wrong Example Analysis:

The prompt led the language model to the wrong answer for the following reasons:

1. Misinterpretation of Task: The prompt instructs the model to analyze the relational inference between the given premise and hypothesis. In this example, the model incorrectly judged the fictional character's belief as a fact rather than an assumption. The premise clearly states that "David remembers that Richard assumes..." with a clear distinction that it's an assumption. But the model mistakenly treats Richard's assumption as a factual claim and thus states that David's memory doesn't assure Richard's assumption's validity, identifying it as a 'non-entailment' case, which is not the task.

2. Overemphasis on Assumptions: The prompt emphasizes the handling of assumptions versus facts. However, it may be leading the model to over-prioritize the idea that assumptions should be treated as non-entailment, even when the task is to analyze the entailment relationship between a factual memory of an assumption and the assumption itself.

3. Unclear Definition of Entailment and Non-Entailment: The definitions and examples of entailment and non-entailment are not sufficiently clear in the prompt. This may result in the model incorrectly categorizing examples, as it appears to have done in this case.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify Task: The prompt should more clearly explain the task requires the model to analyze the relational inference between the given premise and hypothesis, regardless of whether the statements are factual or not.

2. Balance Emphasis: The prompt should balance its heavy emphasis on treating assumptions as 'non-entailment' cases.

3. Revise Definitions: Provide more comprehensive definitions and examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. This will help the model better understand and categorize the statements.

4. Add Examples: Including specific examples in the prompt can help the model to better understand and apply the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

However, it may be leading the model to over-prioritize the idea that assumptions should be treated as non-entailment, even when the task is to analyze the entailment relationship between a factual memory of an assumption and the assumption itself.

3. Unclear Definition of Entailment and Non-Entailment: The definitions and examples of entailment and non-entailment are not sufficiently clear in the prompt. This may result in the model incorrectly categorizing examples, as it appears to have done in this case.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify Task: The prompt should more clearly explain the task requires the model to analyze the relational inference between the given premise and hypothesis, regardless of whether the statements are factual or not.

2. Balance Emphasis: The prompt should balance its heavy emphasis on treating assumptions as 'non-entailment' cases.

3. Revise Definitions: Provide more comprehensive definitions and examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. This will help the model better understand and categorize the statements.

4. Add Examples: Including specific examples in the prompt can help the model to better understand and apply the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze questions about relational inference, focusing particularly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' implies that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not necessarily ensure the truth of another. Consider that a person’s guess or assumption about what another person thinks or believes does not confirm that the second person indeed holds those thoughts or beliefs. Identify the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Treat all information provided as either a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Finally, display your chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Analyze questions dealing with 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in relational inference. When 'entailment' is considered, it means that the truthfulness of one statement ensures the validity of another; on the other hand, 'non-entailment' denotes that the truth of one statement does not automatically ascertain the truth of another. Be mindful that a person’s assumption or guess about the beliefs or thoughts of another person cannot always be equated with the latter's true thoughts or beliefs. Such situations should ideally be treated as 'non-entailment', unless it is explicitly stated or understood that the person's thoughts or beliefs have been recognized or acknowledged. From the provided premises and hypotheses, deduce their relationship and select between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' in accordance to the information given. Handle the given information as either a declaration of fact or an assumption, based on the context. Finally, your selected answer should be presented bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example <1>:

The model's incorrect answer suggests that it's conflating Michael's beliefs about James with what James actually recognizes. Given the nature of the task, this denotes a contraction of the instructions stated in the prompt, specifically the part that says: "...a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs." Essentially, it's overemphasizing the connection between Michael's beliefs and James's recognition, mistaking the former for implying the latter—an instance of incorrect entailment. This could be due to the task's complexity or because the directions fail to sufficiently stress that beliefs about other people's thoughts don't constitute factual indications of these thoughts.

For example <2>:

Like the previous example, it seems that the model doesn't grasp that John's beliefs about Richard don't automatically verify John's beliefs about the man with a painted face. Again, this issue might stem from the model's misunderstanding or disregarding of relevant instructions from the prompt, demonstrating a lack of comprehension of the difference between entailment and false entailment based on assumptions about assumptions. Another potential source of confusion may be the convoluted sentence structure used in the premise, leading the model to oversimplify the situation and arrive at a false conclusion.

To improve the prompt:

1. Reinforce the notion that a person's assumptions about another's thinking or beliefs do not constitute factual evidence of the latter's thoughts or beliefs and cannot be used to draw entailments.
  
2. Place additional emphasis on directing the model to evaluate entailment or non-entailment based solely on the information within the premise without inferring additional connections.

3. The wording or sentence structure of premises and hypotheses could be clearer and less convoluted to reduce misinterpretation. Complex constructions could muddy the implications needed for the modeling process.

4. Include additional or more explicit instructions relating to assumptions about assumptions. For example, alert the model to the fact that an assumption about another person’s assumption does not guarantee the truth of the final assumption. 

5. Provide more examples during training to help the model better understand how to apply the instructions. Each example must differ significantly from the others to expose the model to as many different cases as possible.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to analyze questions about inference relationships, with a specific focus on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In the context of 'entailment', the truth of one statement inherently guarantees the truth of another. 'Non-entailment', in contrast, is when the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily secure the truth of another. Bear in mind when analyzing assumptions that a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true. Remember, focus on the broad action or thought being conveyed in the premise and do not overemphasize the minute or additional details. All information provided should be treated either as a factual statement or an assumption, according to the context. Your chosen answer option must be marked between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Analysis: For this example, the prompt seems to have confused the model by emphasizing the lack of certainty when assumptions are involved. Although the premise indeed mentions that John "sees" rather than "assumes" the situation about Joseph's thoughts, it seems the model nonetheless interpreted this scenario as being uncertain. This shows misunderstanding of the concept of entailment, where the truth of premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Here, if John sees Joseph suspecting something, it must mean Joseph is indeed suspecting it.

<2>
Analysis: In this example, it appears the model has been unable to correctly parse that an inference drawn from someone's assumption does not necessarily make the assumption true. When David assumes something about Sophia, it doesn't guarantee that Sophia is actually assuming that. This might be because the instruction about assumptions might not be clear or emphasized enough for the model.

<3>
Analysis: The mistake in this example seems similar to the first one. Despite the premise clearly stating that Charles "suspects" something about Thomas' knowledge, the model still decides on non-entailment. This may show the model's general struggle with tasks that involve inference about someone's thoughts or beliefs based on another person's perspective.

Improvements:
1. Emphasize in a clearer way that the existence of an assumption stated in the premise does not guarantee its truth in the hypothesis.
2. Reinforce the understanding of entailment. The model must understand that when the premise is that Person A sees or hears or knows that Person B assumes or suspects something, it necessarily entails that Person B is assuming or suspecting that thing.
3. The model also seems to be getting tangled in the chain of assumptions and thoughts involving multiple individuals. So, try to break down and simplify the explanation in the prompt about how it should handle such scenarios.
4. Consider providing explicit examples of entailment and non-entailment to help the model understand the principle better.
5. Make sure to clarify the model of the difference between "seeing" or "knowing" something versus "assuming" or "suspecting" something; the former provides a stronger ground for inference than the latter.
6. Provide more emphasis on treating all information as either factual or an assumption depending on the context and guide the model to be more discerning about the level of certainty associated with a given statement.

response:
<START> Your task is to evaluate inference relationships in questions, primarily concentrating on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

Your primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Avoid getting lost in minor details and keep your attention centered on the overarching action or thought contained in the premise.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building. Hypothesis: Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1) Misinterpretation: The model may reflect a misunderstanding in the mechanics of entailment. While Richard's assumption about Abigail's perception is stated, there is no concrete evidence that Abigail indeed has such a thought, which means the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis.

2) Focus on the Surface: The model might have overly focused on the similarity in content between the premise and the hypothesis while neglecting the fact that the premise is based on Richard's assumption, causing it to inaccurately infer an entailment scenario.

3) Lack of Nuance in Assumptions: An important subtlety is that Richard's assumption does not automatically indicate confirmation of Abigail's thoughts. The model could have misunderstood the nature of assumptions in determining entailment.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Increase Clarity: Be clearer and emphasize that an entailment should only be deduced when there's enough evidence linking the premise and the hypothesis – not based on similarities in their content alone.

2) Explanation: Include more specific instructions on dealing with assumptions about a third party's thoughts or beliefs. Stress that unless these thoughts are confirmed by the person in question, assumptions should not be used to ensure the veracity of the hypothesis.

3) Examples: Incorporate examples that demonstrate the difference between valid entailments and instances where perceived entailments are actually non-entailments. This can guide the model to better understand the subtle distinctions it needs to apply.

4) Discourage Misinterpretation: Do not overemphasize the broad action or thought that the premise portrays. Doing so may encourage the model to disregard the importance of “assumption” and jump to conclusions. 

5) Context: Explain to the model that it should be more attentive to the context and connotations of the prompts and not just interpret them on face value. This will prevent the model from incorrectly inferring relations between premises and hypotheses.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to analyze questions about inference relationships, with a specific focus on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In the context of 'entailment', the truth of one statement inherently guarantees the truth of another. 'Non-entailment', in contrast, is when the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily secure the truth of another. Bear in mind when analyzing assumptions that a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true. Remember, focus on the broad action or thought being conveyed in the premise and do not overemphasize the minute or additional details. All information provided should be treated either as a factual statement or an assumption, according to the context. Your chosen answer option must be marked between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building. Hypothesis: Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1) Misinterpretation: The model may reflect a misunderstanding in the mechanics of entailment. While Richard's assumption about Abigail's perception is stated, there is no concrete evidence that Abigail indeed has such a thought, which means the truth of the premise doesn't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis.

2) Focus on the Surface: The model might have overly focused on the similarity in content between the premise and the hypothesis while neglecting the fact that the premise is based on Richard's assumption, causing it to inaccurately infer an entailment scenario.

3) Lack of Nuance in Assumptions: An important subtlety is that Richard's assumption does not automatically indicate confirmation of Abigail's thoughts. The model could have misunderstood the nature of assumptions in determining entailment.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Increase Clarity: Be clearer and emphasize that an entailment should only be deduced when there's enough evidence linking the premise and the hypothesis – not based on similarities in their content alone.

2) Explanation: Include more specific instructions on dealing with assumptions about a third party's thoughts or beliefs. Stress that unless these thoughts are confirmed by the person in question, assumptions should not be used to ensure the veracity of the hypothesis.

3) Examples: Incorporate examples that demonstrate the difference between valid entailments and instances where perceived entailments are actually non-entailments. This can guide the model to better understand the subtle distinctions it needs to apply.

4) Discourage Misinterpretation: Do not overemphasize the broad action or thought that the premise portrays. Doing so may encourage the model to disregard the importance of “assumption” and jump to conclusions. 

5) Context: Explain to the model that it should be more attentive to the context and connotations of the prompts and not just interpret them on face value. This will prevent the model from incorrectly inferring relations between premises and hypotheses.

(1) Analyze questions about relational inference, focusing particularly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' implies that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not necessarily ensure the truth of another. Consider that a person’s guess or assumption about what another person thinks or believes does not confirm that the second person indeed holds those thoughts or beliefs. Identify the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Treat all information provided as either a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Finally, display your chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

cur_prompt: Your task is to evaluate inference relationships in questions, primarily concentrating on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

Your primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Avoid getting lost in minor details and keep your attention centered on the overarching action or thought contained in the premise.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons for incorrect answers:

Example 1: 

The model seems to misinterpret the prompt's rule about the difference between seeing/knowing/hearing someone's beliefs vs assuming them. The premise states that "David suspects that Abigail understands that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home." David's suspicion implies knowledge about Abigail's understanding, making it an entailment situation. However, the model mistakenly labels this scenario as "non-entailment". 

Example 2: 

The model again seems to be confused about the aspect of assuming vs knowing someone's belief. The premise states that "Ava believes that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees." Here, Ava's belief does not solidify the truth of Olivia's thought, making it a non-entailment scenario. However, the model incorrectly assigns this scenario as entailment.

Based on the wrong examples, these are potential areas for improvement:

1. Clearly define and emphasize the difference between assuming versus knowing/seeing/hearing someone's beliefs. The model seems to struggle in distinguishing between these two scenarios, leading to incorrect answers.

2. Provide more explicit explanations or examples of situations where a person's assumptions or beliefs about another person do not necessarily mean the latter person's beliefs are valid. 

3. Clarify that the task is not to judge whether the premise is true, but to judge if the premise would necessarily make the hypothesis true if it were true.

4. Specify that the model needs to focus on the main relationship between the individuals in the premise and hypothesis and not on the detailed actions they're performing. 

5. Consider adding a reminder to the model to carefully follow the rules laid out in the prompt. It may also be helpful to review the prompt periodically to ensure these rules are ingrained into the model's predictions.

'Entailment' implies that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not necessarily ensure the truth of another. Consider that a person’s guess or assumption about what another person thinks or believes does not confirm that the second person indeed holds those thoughts or beliefs. Identify the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Treat all information provided as either a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Finally, display your chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to analyze questions about inference relationships, with a specific focus on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In the context of 'entailment', the truth of one statement inherently guarantees the truth of another. 'Non-entailment', in contrast, is when the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily secure the truth of another. Bear in mind when analyzing assumptions that a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true. Remember, focus on the broad action or thought being conveyed in the premise and do not overemphasize the minute or additional details. All information provided should be treated either as a factual statement or an assumption, according to the context. Your chosen answer option must be marked between <answer> and </answer>.

In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

Your primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true.

<START> Your task is to evaluate statements, focusing intensely on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of a premise creates a guarantee for the truth of the hypothesis. In contrast, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of a premise doesn't necessarily secure the truth of the hypothesis.

It's important to remember this principle: If one individual 'sees', 'knows', or 'hears' that another individual 'assumes' or 'suspects' something, it indicates that the first person has reliable knowledge of the second person's beliefs based on the premise. It characterizes an 'entailment' scenario, where if the premise is accurate, the hypothesis is also true.

Conversely, if a person is stated to 'assume' or 'think' that another person 'assumes' or 'suspects' something, this provides no solid foundation for the authenticity of the hypothesis. This represents a 'non-entailment' scenario. The assumptions or beliefs of the first person about the second do not validate or confirm the second person's thoughts or assumptions.

Your main activity is to study and determine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis. You need to identify if it's an 'entailment' scenario, in which the premise guarantees the hypothesis' truth, or a 'non-entailment' scenario where the premise doesn't explicitly establish the hypothesis as true.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James understands that William suspects that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts. Hypothesis: William suspects that James understands that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

In the given example, the prompt fails to provide the model with clear guidelines for handling cases where the premise and the hypothesis are reversed roles of each other. In the example, James is said to understand that William suspects something in the premise. However, in the hypothesis, the roles are reversed, assuming that William suspects that James understands the same thing. There are no specific instructions within the prompt that guide the model on how to handle this particular scenario and as a result, the model incorrectly predicts this as an entailment scenario instead of non-entailment.

Steps of the wrong answer:

1. The model received the input question with the premise and hypotheses. 
2. The premises provided suggested that James had a certain understanding of what William suspects (James -> William). However, the hypothesis reversed the roles (William -> James).
3. The prompt did not provide explicit instructions on how to handle role reversal between the premise and hypothesis. Therefore the model predicted it as 'entailment' primarily based on the existing guiding principles provided.
4. This led to an incorrect prediction, as the correct answer should be 'non-entailment'.

Based on the above steps, the following improvements could be made in the prompt:

1. The prompt needs clearer instructions on handling role reversal or inverted scenarios between the premise and the hypothesis.
2. Including more explicit indications of how to interpret scenarios where the premise and hypothesis have similar content but different subjects could be beneficial.
3. Detailed clarification of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could be provided, specifically making it clear that role reversal does not automatically infer entailment.
4. The prompt could emphasize on the point that the assumption or understanding of one person about another does not necessarily confirm the assumption or understanding of the second person about the first.

Your task is to assess inference relationships among provided statements, focusing primarily on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the validity of one statement automatically assures the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the legitimacy of one claim does not guarantee the truth of another claim. It's crucial to note that in analyzing hypotheses involving assumptions or beliefs about another person, the mere assumption doesn't affirm that the individual in question truly possesses that belief - such a supposition does not infer confirmation, but uncertainty instead.

However, there are certain exceptions. If an individual A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, this implies that A has credible knowledge of B's thoughts or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is accurate, then the hypothesis is also consequently veritable.

Alternatively, if an individual A is purported to "assume" or "think" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it doesn't provide a sturdy base for the validity of the hypothesis. This might be a potential 'non-entailment' scenario because A's assumptions or suspicions towards B do not determine the truth of what B assumes or presumes.

Importantly, when the premise and the hypothesis show role reversal or inverted scenarios, consider them as potential 'non-entailment' situations. In such scenarios, the fact that one individual assumes something about another individual does not necessarily mean that this assumption is reciprocated.

Your primary duty is to unravel the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, determining if it's an 'entailment' situation where the premise certifies the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' circumstance where the premise does not conclusively affirm the hypothesis. Avoid getting tangled in minor details and focus on the general action or thought embedded in the premise. Treat all the information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption depending on the context provided. Encapsulate your chosen answer convincingly between <answer> and </answer>.

If an individual A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, this implies that A has credible knowledge of B's thoughts or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is accurate, then the hypothesis is also consequently veritable.

Alternatively, if an individual A is purported to "assume" or "think" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it doesn't provide a sturdy base for the validity of the hypothesis. This might be a potential 'non-entailment' scenario because A's assumptions or suspicions towards B do not determine the truth of what B assumes or presumes.

Importantly, when the premise and the hypothesis show role reversal or inverted scenarios, consider them as potential 'non-entailment' situations. In such scenarios, the fact that one individual assumes something about another individual does not necessarily mean that this assumption is reciprocated.

Your primary duty is to unravel the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, determining if it's an 'entailment' situation where the premise certifies the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' circumstance where the premise does not conclusively affirm the hypothesis. Avoid getting tangled in minor details and focus on the general action or thought embedded in the premise. Treat all the information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption depending on the context provided. Encapsulate your chosen answer convincingly between <answer> and </answer>.
cur_prompt: Your task is to evaluate inference relationships in questions, primarily concentrating on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: James suspects that a man is painting a city scene on a canvas in the street. Hypothesis: James suspects that a man is painting outside.
Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment
Reason: The language model may be struggling with the refinement of details in the premise. It may be treating the specificity of 'city scene on a canvas in the street' as separate from the more generalized 'painting outside', rather than encompassed within it. Consequently, the model does not recognize that the hypothesis is included in the premise, leading it to incorrectly classify the relation as 'non-entailment'.

<2>
Question: Evelyn thinks that Charles sees that an officer in a black uniform and hat stands to the left of a large structure with other officers in the background. Hypothesis: Charles sees that an officer in a black uniform and hat stands to the left of a large structure with other officers in the background. 
Wrong Answer: (A) entailment
Reason: The language model may be mistaken by the identical content of the premise and the hypothesis. It neglects the fact that Evelyn's belief about Charles' vision does not automatically confirm that Charles indeed sees that situation. The model's misunderstanding of the distinction between 'thinking' and 'seeing, hearing, or knowing' might be leading to this incorrect categorization of 'entailment'.

<3>
Question: Sophia knows that Evelyn suspects that a man in a gray coat is walking on a fallen tree trunk in a forest. Hypothesis: Evelyn suspects that Sophia knows that a man in a gray coat is walking on a fallen tree trunk in a forest.
Wrong Answer: (A) entailment
Reason: The model's understanding of the direction of knowledge may be flawed. While Sophia's knowledge about Evelyn's suspicion is specified in the premise, it does not entail that Evelyn has any suspicions about Sophia's knowledge. The model's lack of awareness of this subtlety may be leading to the incorrect classification of 'entailment'.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify Definitions: Provide clearer and more explicit definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Emphasize that 'entailment' requires the premise to guarantee the truth of the hypothesis.
   
2. Refine Assumption Understanding: Strengthen the model's understanding of the implications of assumptions. Make it clear that someone's thoughts or beliefs about another person do not determine the latter’s actions or thoughts.

3. Detail Interpretation: Guide the language model to correctly parse details in the premise and hypothesis. The model needs to understand when details in the premise are more specific versions of the hypothesis and when they diverge.

4. Address Direction of Knowledge: Accentuate the importance of the direction or flow of knowledge or thoughts in influencing the entailment relationship. The model should know that A's knowledge about B's thoughts doesn't mean B has any knowledge about A's thoughts.

5. Provide Examples: Use examples to illustrate each point, making sure to include complex scenarios that test the model's understanding of these concepts.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze questions about relational inference, focusing particularly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' implies that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not necessarily ensure the truth of another. Consider that a person’s guess or assumption about what another person thinks or believes does not confirm that the second person indeed holds those thoughts or beliefs. Identify the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Treat all information provided as either a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Finally, display your chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to analyze questions about inference relationships, with a specific focus on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In the context of 'entailment', the truth of one statement inherently guarantees the truth of another. 'Non-entailment', in contrast, is when the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily secure the truth of another. Bear in mind when analyzing assumptions that a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true. Remember, focus on the broad action or thought being conveyed in the premise and do not overemphasize the minute or additional details. All information provided should be treated either as a factual statement or an assumption, according to the context. Your chosen answer option must be marked between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to evaluate inference relationships in questions, primarily concentrating on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

Your primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Avoid getting lost in minor details and keep your attention centered on the overarching action or thought contained in the premise. Treat all information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption based on the provided context. Make sure to bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

response:
<START> 

Your assignment involves examining inference relationships present in various scenarios, focusing keenly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In scenarios referred to as 'entailment', the authenticity of one statement instantly verifies the accuracy of another. In contrast, 'non-entailment' scenarios are where the truth of one statement doesn't automatically verify the legitimacy of another. 

When assessing situations that encompass assumptions, understand that if an individual, A, "believes" or "thinks" something about another person, B, it doesn't conclusively establish that person B holds that belief. However, in exceptions when it's stated that person A "sees", "knows", or "hears" that person B "assumes" or "presumes" something, we infer that person A holds substantive knowledge of person B's assumptions or thoughts. In such cases, if the premise holds, the hypothesis is also deemed true. 

Alternatively, when a person A "assumes" or "believes" that person B "suspects" something, it doesn't offer a solid validation for the hypothesis, marking a potential 'non-entailment' situation. In this case, person A's perceptions about person B don't confirm the latter's suspicions or assumptions. 

Focus your considerations on discerning the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, marking whether it's an 'entailment', where the premise vouches for the hypothesis's truth, or a 'non-entailment', where it doesn't guarantee its validity. Ignore side details and concentrate on the primary action or thought in context. Take all pieces of information as either established facts or assumptions as per the given context. 

Remember that the nature and direction of knowledge or thoughts significantly impact the entailment relationship. A's knowledge about B's thoughts doesn't entail that B is aware of this. Keep in mind that a general assumption can often encompass a more specific related one. Thoughtfully analyze the given premises and hypotheses, and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', appropriately bracketing your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, distinguishing them as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Conclude your assessment with the right option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, distinguishing them as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Conclude your assessment with the right option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. Just because William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread, it does not mean that William himself thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, distinguishing them as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Conclude your assessment with the right option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma knows that Isabella thinks that the man in the blue shirt is relaxing on the rocks. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that Emma knows that the man in the blue shirt is relaxing on the rocks.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The logical connection between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. Emma knowing that Isabella thinks something implies that Isabella actually thinks that thing. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining the first wrong example, the incorrect answer appears to stem from a misunderstanding about the nature of "thinking" and "knowing" in the context of entailment. The model seems to assume that "thinking" and "knowing" are not interchangeable, and that one person's thought about another person's "knowledge" doesn't constitute the first person's understanding of the situation. This is not necessarily incorrect, but it's more nuanced than the task requires and could be leading to the wrong answer.

In the second wrong example, the error seems to come from incorrectly reversing the premises in the logical relationship. The model acknowledges the entailment between the premise and hypothesis, but fails to address the difference in directionality: that Emma knows what Isabella thinks does not entail that Isabella thinks Emma knows.

In both of these issues, the model struggles with the nuances of subjective viewpoints (thinking vs. knowing, and reversed perspectives). This could be due to the lack of explicit instruction in the prompt to carefully consider these cognitive views.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Be explicit about considering subjective viewpoints: Add verbiage to specifically instruct the model to analyze the relation between subjective perspectives in the premises and hypotheses (for instance, 'thinking' vs 'knowing').
2. Highlight directionality: Specify that the direction of the relationship between subjects (people, in these cases) in a statement is significant, for example, 'A knows that B thinks' does not automatically entail 'B thinks that A knows'.
3. Provide examples: Give the model examples of cases where similar errors could occur and detail how to handle these situations.
4. Clarify terms: Ensure the model has a clear understanding of the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in various contexts, including the nuanced ones.
5. Question reasoning: Instruct the model to consider its reasoning for each decision, reflecting on whether the answer adheres strictly to the logic or involves additional assumptions.
6. Clarify desired answer format: Make sure the model knows that it must give an explicit entailment/non-entailment response alongside its reasoning. It is especially important to remind the model to include the answer within the designated bracket areas as well.

Example Analysis:

In the given example, the task requires assessing the logical connection between a premise and a hypothesis. In this particular case, the premise is 'William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom', and the hypothesis is 'William believes that the man is sweeping dirt'.

The model wrongly classifies this as a 'non-entailment' case. According to the model, the backdrop of the premise does not necessarily imply that William believes the man is sweeping dirt. Nevertheless, in general understanding, it can be argued that if William believes that a man is sweeping with a broom, it can be naturally understood that the man is sweeping something, which can be dirt.

Reasons for Incorrect Response:

1. Ambiguity in Information: The details given in the premise and the hypothesis are slightly ambiguous, which could lead to potential misinterpretation. For instance, it is not explicitly mentioned what the man is sweeping in the premise, leading the model to conclude that it cannot be definitely stated that the man is sweeping dirt. 

2. Vague Definitions: The definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' might not be precise or clear enough for the model to draw accurate conclusions. In this case, while a human might infer that sweeping typically involves dirt, the model may require an explicit connection to draw that conclusion.

3. Lack of Explanation: The prompt does not explicitly mandate the need to justify the choice between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. As such, the model made a choice without explaining why.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clear Definitions: Define 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' more clearly to avoid any ambiguity in their interpretation.

2. Explanation Requirement: Require the model to provide the reasoning behind its choice of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to ensure it has correctly understood and analyzed the premise and hypothesis.

3. More Context: Consider adding a step where the model needs to clarify any ambiguities in the premise or hypothesis before making the judgement.

4. Sample Guidance: Provide examples to demonstrate correct analysis and answers. This can include both straightforward cases and more complex ones where a 'common sense' reading might contradict a strictly logical interpretation. 

5. Tighter Language: Revise the language to ensure that the model understands it needs to determine what is inferred by the premise, rather than what is explicitly stated.

1. Clear Definitions: Define 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' more clearly to avoid any ambiguity in their interpretation.

2. Explanation Requirement: Require the model to provide the reasoning behind its choice of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to ensure it has correctly understood and analyzed the premise and hypothesis.

3. More Context: Consider adding a step where the model needs to clarify any ambiguities in the premise or hypothesis before making the judgement.

4. Sample Guidance: Provide examples to demonstrate correct analysis and answers. This can include both straightforward cases and more complex ones where a 'common sense' reading might contradict a strictly logical interpretation. 

5. Tighter Language: Revise the language to ensure that the model understands it needs to determine what is inferred by the premise, rather than what is explicitly stated.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, distinguishing them as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Conclude your assessment with the right option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, distinguishing them as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Conclude your assessment with the right option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William assumes that Emma sees that a dog with a ball in his mouth running down a road covered in leaves. Hypothesis: Emma sees that a dog with a ball in his mouth running down a road covered in leaves.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise entails the hypothesis because William assumes that Emma sees the specific scenario described in the hypothesis. Therefore, the correct option is (A) entailment. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, distinguishing them as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Conclude your assessment with the right option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard assumes that James assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise entails the hypothesis because Richard assuming that James assumes something implies that Richard himself assumes the same thing. Therefore, the correct option is (A) entailment.
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the language model's mistake seems to stem from an over-simplified understanding of 'assumption' within the premise. The AI interpreted it as the event itself taking place, i.e., 'Emma sees that a dog ...'. However, 'William assumes that Emma sees' does not definitely affirm that 'Emma sees'. The model misinterpreted the premise and chose 'entailment'. 

Wrong Example 2:
Again, the language model misinterprets 'assumes' in the context. It believed that 'Richard assuming that James assumes something' automatically means 'Richard assumes the same thing'. However, this is not necessarily correct - it's quite possible for someone to assume that another person is assuming something, without them also assuming that same thing. As such, the connection between the premise and hypothesis is not strong, yet the AI incorrectly labeled it as an 'entailment'. 

Aspects that need improving:

1. Enhanced understanding of the logical relationships: The model should be better trained to differentiate between assumptions, beliefs, and factual statements to assess the connection more accurately. 

2. Amend prompt to introduce ambiguity handling: One way to reduce such errors might be to revise the prompts to specify that the absolute existence of the event/hypothesis in the premise should be what determines 'entailment'––not assumptions or indirect beliefs. 

3. Improve prompt clarity: Detailed instructions must be added to prompt stating that assuming about an assumption does not translate to a direct affirmation.

This does not necessarily mean that Thomas actually thinks that construction workers use cables to hang from the sides of buildings. Amelia could be mistaken in her understanding of Thomas's thoughts. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

"Premise: Amelia understands that Thomas thinks that construction workers use cables to hang from the sides of buildings. Hypothesis: Thomas thinks that construction workers use cables to hang from the sides of buildings."

This does not necessarily mean that Thomas actually thinks that construction workers use cables to hang from the sides of buildings. Amelia could be mistaken in her understanding of Thomas's thoughts. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."

Reasons for error:
The error seems to be arising from the model making extra assumptions as well as a lack of precise understanding of the entailment question. The task is to understand whether the premise entails the hypothesis (that is, whether the first statement implies the second), not to question the veracity or accuracy of the premise. The model seems to be considering the possibility of Amelia being mistaken about Thomas's thoughts, which is beyond the scope of the task.

Prompt Improvement:

1. The prompt can provide clearer instructions about the task of understanding "entailment". It should specify that entailment should not consider the veracity of the premise or the hypothesis and only focus on if the premise logically infers the hypothesis.

2. Instructing the model to consider the exact wording of the statements rather than potential implications or connotations can help to avoid making extra assumptions.

3. Explicitly stating that the language model’s task is to evaluate logical connections between phrases rather than to cast judgment on the statement's truth could be beneficial to avoid misinterpretations.

4. The term "subjective viewpoints" can be misinterpreted as speculation on the accuracy of the premise or hypothesis, which could lead to errors. The prompt could be improved by removing this term or specifying it doesn't refer to questioning the statement's veracity. 

5. The mention of “thinking” and “knowing” perspectives may lead the model to over-emphasize these aspects, introducing unnecessary assumptions. This could be clarified or removed in the improved prompt.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a gymnast is seen defying gravity as she performs an impressive move several feet above the parallel bars. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that the gymnast is a woman.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis in this scenario is non-entailment. Olivia suspecting that the gymnast is defying gravity does not necessarily entail that Olivia suspects the gymnast is a woman. The gender of the gymnast is not logically connected to the act of defying gravity. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis in this scenario is non-entailment. Just because Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside does not necessarily mean that Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. The first statement is about Taylor's belief in William's understanding, while the second statement is about Taylor's belief in the action of a dog. Therefore, there is no logical entailment between the two statements. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Examples Analysis:

<1> The model got the first example wrong because the prompt failed to explicitly emphasize that the model needs to precisely value the description of the subjects in the premise and hypothesis. The premise refers to a "gymnast", which is not gender-specific but often associated with a female athlete. By failing to properly factor this into consideration, the model wrongly equated "non-entailment" with a lack of clear gender mention in the premise sentence. 

<2> In the second example, the language model made an error due to the intricate nature of the premise and hypothesis. Here, the model failed to understand that if 'Taylor believes' in 'William's understanding' of a situation, it implicitly entails that 'Taylor believes' the underlying situation (the dog jumping to catch the red ball) itself.

Essentially, the model fell into the trap of over-sectionalizing the two statements without considering the possible implied relationships. Unfortunately, the current prompt does not instruct the model to carefully interpret potential indirect logical connections between subjects.

Improvements:

1. Improve the precise instruction: The prompt needs clearer guidance on how to correctly interpret the semantic contexts that can potentially alter the entailment relationship. 

2. Subject specificity: Explicitly ask the model to take into account subject descriptions, treating the subjects in the sentences not just as items but according to their actual/contextual meanings.

3. Direct and indirect connections: The revision should guide the model to analyze both direct and indirect factors contributing to the entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

4. Nested understanding: The prompt should ask the model to consider nested layers of understanding, especially when beliefs or thoughts of one subject about another subject's perspective are involved.

The improved prompt might read like this:

"Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, evaluating both direct and indirect logical connections, encompassing nested layers of understanding, and specifically paying attention to the contextual implication of the subjects described. Distinguish the connection as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', avoiding any extra assumptions not presented by the texts. Provide reasoning to back up your decision, enclosing your final response in brackets. Also, take into account how your analysis compares with other similar tasks, scrutinizing whether it strictly adheres to logical connections or is influenced by any assumptions."

Hypothesis: Taylor suspects that they are in a gym. Options: (A) entailment (B) non-entailment

Model's Response: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Correct answer: (B) non-entailment

Reasoning for Incorrect Answer:
1. Subjective Viewpoints Ignored: The prompt calls for consideration of all subjective viewpoints, however, the model fails to do so. Taylor's knowledge or suspicions are not stated or implied in the premise and should be viewed as separate from William's perspective. This would result in a 'non-entailment' connection.
2. Misinterpretation of 'Entailment': It appears that the model misunderstands the meaning of 'entailment'. The answer suggests that the model believes 'entailment' to mean 'is in line with', whereas 'entailment' actually pertains to a strong logical connection that guarantees the truth of the hypothesis if the premise is true. 
3. Ignored the Directionality of the relationship: Taylor's suspicion and the gym are distinct subjects and their link is not addressed in the premise. It seems that model is not considering the directionality of the relationships between subjects and how it influences entailment, as required by the prompt.

Possible Improvements:
1. Clarify Definitions: The definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' should be made clear in the prompt, so the model doesn't misinterpret these concepts.
2. Highlight the importance of Different Subjects: The prompt needs to emphasize that different subjects' viewpoints and knowledge should be treated independently unless there are explicit linking elements within the premise and hypothesis.
3. Encourage Thorough Analysis: The prompt should stress on properly analyzing relationships, including directionality, between all mentioned subjects.
4. Incorporate Control for Over-assumption: Strengthen the instruction in the prompt to avoid extra assumptions, and further include the potential impact of such assumptions on the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

Wrong Example Analysis:

In the provided example, the language model incorrectly predicted the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as 'non-entailment'. The premise states that Robert suspects three adults are working in a garden, near a fence in the yard. The hypothesis simplifies this, stating that Robert suspects the adults are outside in the garden. In this case, the hypothesis is a subset of the premise, meaning that the premise does entail the hypothesis. The language model made an error in interpreting the relationship, by assuming that the adults could be inside the garden near the fence.

Reasons for wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of Context: In this case the error seems to stem from a misinterpretation of the hypothetical context. The language model falsely assumed that being in a garden could mean being inside the garden as opposed to being outside.

2. Overemphasizing on the words: The language model put too much emphasis that the details need to directly affirm. In reality, the details can also indirectly affirm, which would still count as entailment. 

3. Misunderstanding the notion of 'entailment': The model erred in understanding that entailment can occur even when the hypothesis is not a direct restatement of the premise, but is still logically implied by it.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. An explanation that entailment can still be identified even when the hypothesis is not a direct restatement of the premise, but is still logically contained within it, can help improve the understanding of what 'entailment' implies.

2. Instructions can be updated to indicate that not every detail in premise needs to be present in hypothesis for it to be an entailment.

3. Addition of context interpretation guidance can foster better understanding of complex scenarios where spacial or temporal cues exist.

Based on these recommendations, an improved prompt could be:
"Determine whether the events within the hypothesis are logically contained within the premise. Defining them as either 'entailment', if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise even if it is not an exact replication, or 'non-entailment', if the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from the premise. Assumptions are not sufficient to infer entailment, rather concrete events are required. At the end of your analysis, select from the options of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and indicate your chosen option between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.".

gradient:
<1> 

Reason:
In this example, the model fails to recognize some implicit details. The premise describes a tennis player making an aggressive swing, which entails that the player is holding a tennis racket even if it's not clearly stated. The prompt instructions should have highlighted the necessity for the model to consider implicit or indirect entailments as well as direct ones.

Improvements:

1. The prompt could explicitly instruct the model to take into account not only direct implications but also indirect ones. For instance, an event described in the premise might not directly affirm the hypothesis but can implicitly support it.

2. The prompt's wording might be confusing to the model due to the use of complex language. It could be simplified to allow the model to better understand the expected action.

3. The instruction could highlight the importance of not only focusing on the main action but also on the surrounding contextual elements of a scenario that could affirm the hypothesis.

Revised Prompt:
Analyze both direct and indirect implications of the events described in the premises and hypotheses. Understand that a premise can entail a hypothesis even if it does not state so explicitly. After analyzing, categorize the relationship as 'entailment' if the premise indirectly or directly affirms the hypothesis, and 'non-entailment' if it doesn't.

This does not directly affirm that Charles actually thinks that three children are in a black dog kennel, as it could be a misunderstanding or misinformation. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The model's input is:
Analyze the actual occurrence of events described in the premises and hypotheses, rather than mere assumptions or beliefs. Determine whether the premises logically affirm the hypotheses, defining them as either 'entailment' if the premise directly affirms the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if it doesn't. Note that an assumption about an event in the premise does not necessarily suggest the actual occurrence of the event in the hypothesis. At the end of your analysis, provide the correct option between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', denoting it between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. However, it does not directly affirm that Taylor believes a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The issue seems to occur because the model is overemphasizing the point that "an assumption about an event in the premise does not necessarily suggest the actual occurrence of the event in the hypothesis." It is interpreting the premise to be making an assumption about Charles' thoughts, while the hypothesis is stating them as a fact. However, in the context of the task, if the premise states that someone has a certain belief, it should be enough to affirm the hypothesis if it also involves that belief. The prompt should clarify that the belief stated in the premise should be taken as true for the purposes of evaluating entailment, instead of encouraging the model to question its validity.

Example 2:
Similarly, the initial prompt is causing confusion as it indicates to the model to question the validity of stated beliefs. While the stimulus tells that 'Taylor believes that William thinks a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside', according to the model's interpretation, this does not directly affirm that Taylor herself believes that the dog jumps. However, in assuming Taylor's statement to be true, we can infer that she accepts the fact that a dog jumps to catch a red ball, which is what the hypothesis states. The prompt should guide the model to accept the nested beliefs within the premise as part of the person's belief system, rather than considering them as separate events.

Improvements:
1) Clarify the structure of beliefs: The prompt should explicitly state that if a belief is described in the premise, it should be considered as being held true by the person mentioned.
2) Encourage acceptance of premises: In the instructions, instead of suggesting the model to question the accuracy of assumptions or beliefs, ask it to take the premise as a fact.
3) Description of entailment: The model needs a clearer understanding of entailment. More emphasis should be given to how the entirety of the premise doesn't need to affirm the hypothesis, but elements of the premise should.
4) Give examples: The prompt would benefit from examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to help the model establish a clearer understanding.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example <1>, the model made an error because it didn't accurately interpret the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. In the premise, Joseph assumes that a man is jumping up in the air, which logically implies that a man is jumping, as posited in the hypothesis. However, the model seems to have focused too much on the additional details in the premise (like the man splitting his legs and having his mouth open) and concluded that the lack of these details in the hypothesis made the two statements non-entailing. This suggests that the model might need a clearer explanation about the concept of entailment, particularly emphasizing that a premise can still entail a hypothesis even if it contains additional details not present in the hypothesis.

For example <2>, the error occurred because the model didn't correctly analyze the respective roles of John and Charles in the premise and hypothesis. While the premise posits that John believes that Charles thinks a certain thing, the hypothesis posits that John himself thinks that thing. These are fundamentally different scenarios; knowing what John thinks Charles believes doesn't necessarily tell us what John himself believes. It seems the model may have overlooked this distinction due to the complexity of the sentence structure. The prompt may need to guide the model to pay more attention to the exact wording of each sentence and consider the potential distinctions between people's beliefs about others' beliefs versus their own beliefs.

Similarly, in example <3>, the model made a mistake because it didn't interpret the role of Emma and Isabella in the premise and hypothesis correctly. Just because Emma knows what Isabella thinks doesn't necessarily mean that Isabella also knows what Emma thinks. The prompt may need further refinement to underline the importance of carefully considering the precise structure and content of each sentence.

Upon examining these examples, the critical aspects that can improve the prompt include:

1. Guide the model to understand that a premise may entail a hypothesis even if it contains more information or details than the hypothesis.
2. Explicitly instruct the model to pay close attention to the exact wording and structure of each sentence, and carefully interpret any distinctions between people's beliefs about others' beliefs versus their own beliefs.
3. Further emphasize the key terms and concepts related to entailment to ensure the model accurately applies them when comparing the premise and hypothesis.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this question, the model misinterpreted the direction of perception. The premise is "Ava sees that Olivia thinks…" while the hypothesis is "Olivia thinks that Ava sees…". The entailment relationship is not true in this direction, hence the correct answer is non-entailment. The model likely committed the error because the prompt does not clearly instruct it to account for the direction and source of perception, thought or belief in reading the sentences.

Example 2:
Similar to the first example, the model does not correctly gauge the source of suspicion or thought. The premise is "Taylor suspects that Isabella thinks…" while the hypothesis is "Isabella thinks…". Even if Taylor suspects Isabella thinks something, it does not ensure that Isabella actually does think that. Therefore, the correct answer is non-entailment. Here, the model failed to consider the implications of the word 'suspects', leading to the incorrect inference.

Example 3:
In this case, the model again fails to comprehend the implications of the words 'assumes'. The premise is "Isabella assumes that Olivia believes…" while the hypothesis is "Olivia believes…". Just because Isabella assumes Olivia believes something, it doesn't prove that Olivia actually believes it. So the correct answer is non-entailment. The model seems to struggle dealing with the level of certainty required for an entailment when terms about speculation or assumption are involved.

Improvements for Prompt:
Based on the errors above, the prompt can be improved in the following ways:

1. More emphasis should be placed on the careful comprehension of words like 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', and 'assumes'. These words can change the direction and certainty of the statements, affecting whether they are entailment, non-entailment, or contradictions.
   
2. Clearer instructions about the importance of considering the direction and source of perception, assumption, suspicion, etc., in determining the entailment relationship should be included in the prompt.
   
3. Explanation and guidance on how to handle situations where the premise or hypothesis involves assumption or suspicion should be added. It should remind the AI that assumptions and suspicions do not confirm the truth of a given statement.
   
4. The model needs to consider the exact semantic and syntactic structures of both sentences. If there is any modification, the relationship might fall into non-entailment rather than entailment.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first wrong example, the model failed to understand the core difference in context between the premise and the hypothesis. It incorrectly assumed the hypothesis to be contained within the premise by ignoring the fact that the premise refers to a specific assumption by 'James' about 'Taylor's' assumption. Therefore, 'James' assuming something about 'Taylor's' thoughts doesn't automatically imply that 'James' holds the same assumptions himself. It appears that the model didn't fully parse the role of 'Taylor' in the first sentence and how the character relates to the overall meaning and context.

For the second wrong example, the model once again's presumed direct entailment despite a difference in context. The premise revolves around 'Evelyn's' perspective, while the hypothesis is based on 'Thomas's' view. The model overlooked this nuance and incorrectly deduced entailment between the two.

In the third case, the model seemed to ignore the part about 'Richard' assuming before the event about 'Abigail,' and just matched the event from the premise and hypothesis, assuming entailment.

The fourth wrong example was similar. It had given the entailment answer by only comparing similar events in both the premise and the hypothesis, without considering the individual's perspective (Sophia and Robert) that the events were based on.

These mistakes seem to come from a common failure of the model to correctly grasp the effect of perspective in a sentence. The model is not prioritizing the importance of individual 'assumptions' or 'thoughts' in assessing each sentence's overall context.

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clearer that the model needs to take into account the perspective from which each sentence is narrated.

2. Emphasize the requirement to consider every word and its role within the sentence, including the terms that define perspectives and assumptions.

3. addition of more explicit instructions for addressing nested assumptions or perspective shifts within the text.

4. Include a stronger emphasis on the role of context in understanding entailment.

5. Add clarifications stating that the presence of similar events or situations in both the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The same applies to the presence of similar characters, unless their roles and perspectives are also similar.

6. Instruct the model to take into account the subject of perception (e.g., who sees, believes, or assumes something) in the sentences. 

7. Modify the instruction to include consideration of the structure of the sentences as well as the events they describe. 

8. Amplify on the point that simply having similar narrative contexts isn't enough for entailment, each component's relationship and placement must also be considered.

For the first wrong example, the model failed to understand the core difference in context between the premise and the hypothesis. It incorrectly assumed the hypothesis to be contained within the premise by ignoring the fact that the premise refers to a specific assumption by 'James' about 'Taylor's' assumption. Therefore, 'James' assuming something about 'Taylor's' thoughts doesn't automatically imply that 'James' holds the same assumptions himself. It appears that the model didn't fully parse the role of 'Taylor' in the first sentence and how the character relates to the overall meaning and context.

For the second wrong example, the model once again's presumed direct entailment despite a difference in context. The premise revolves around 'Evelyn's' perspective, while the hypothesis is based on 'Thomas's' view. The model overlooked this nuance and incorrectly deduced entailment between the two.

In the third case, the model seemed to ignore the part about 'Richard' assuming before the event about 'Abigail,' and just matched the event from the premise and hypothesis, assuming entailment.

The fourth wrong example was similar. It had given the entailment answer by only comparing similar events in both the premise and the hypothesis, without considering the individual's perspective (Sophia and Robert) that the events were based on.

These mistakes seem to come from a common failure of the model to correctly grasp the effect of perspective in a sentence. The model is not prioritizing the importance of individual 'assumptions' or 'thoughts' in assessing each sentence's overall context.

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clearer that the model needs to take into account the perspective from which each sentence is narrated.

2. Emphasize the requirement to consider every word and its role within the sentence, including the terms that define perspectives and assumptions.

3. addition of more explicit instructions for addressing nested assumptions or perspective shifts within the text.

4. Include a stronger emphasis on the role of context in understanding entailment.

5. Add clarifications stating that the presence of similar events or situations in both the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The same applies to the presence of similar characters, unless their roles and perspectives are also similar.

6. Instruct the model to take into account the subject of perception (e.g., who sees, believes, or assumes something) in the sentences. 

7. Modify the instruction to include consideration of the structure of the sentences as well as the events they describe. 

8. Amplify on the point that simply having similar narrative contexts isn't enough for entailment, each component's relationship and placement must also be considered.

(1) Answer questions which involve entailment analysis between sentences. In the question provided, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your understanding of entailment. Your answer choices are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. When making your decision, consider whether the premise implies the hypothesis, contradicts it or is identical to it. If in doubt, remember that an identical premise and hypothesis always denotes 'entailment'. The goal is to understand the semantic correlation between sentences. Provide your answer with the choice bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

<START>Answer questions that draw upon entailment analysis between sentences. In each question, your task is to discern the logical relation between two statements: a premise and a hypothesis. Your conclusions should be based on a thorough analysis of the stated premise and hypothesis, considering elements such as the speaker's perspective, context, the subject of perception (like who sees, believes, assumes, etc.) and the distinct roles of individual words. You have two answer choices: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 

Entailment refers to situations where the truth of the hypothesis inevitably follows from the truth of the premise. However, it's crucial to understand that identical narratives or similar contextual factors in both premise and hypothesis do not always equate to 'entailment'. For entailment to exist, each component's relationship and placement within the sentences should align, not just the events they describe.

Furthermore, consider nested assumptions or changes in perspective within each sentence. Remember, a same character appearing in the premise and hypothesis doesn't always translate to entailment unless their roles and perspectives are identical.

Take your time to account for the role and significance of each word in the sentence, especially those referring to perspective and assumptions. Pay close attention to the structure and context of the sentences. With these in mind, make an informed decision on whether the premise implies, contradicts, or is identical to the hypothesis. 

After your analysis, deliver your answer in the format: <answer>(A) entailment</answer> or <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>, according to what best represents the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis.<END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava suspects that Charlotte sees that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down. Hypothesis: Ava suspects that one man in baseball cap looks out while two men look down.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Ava suspects that Charlotte sees something, it doesn't necessarily mean that Ava's suspicion is correct. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be inferred from the premise.

Premise: John learns that Charlotte assumes that players from two opposing teams wearing colorful cleats struggle to gain control over a ball on an AstroTurf field.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first example, the model erroneously determines 'non-entailment' as the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The error could be attributed to the model's misunderstanding of the task at hand. Although the model rightly notes that Ava's suspicion doesn't necessarily denote truth, it fails to understand that within the context of this task, Ava's suspicion about Charlotte's perception is not being evaluated for its truth value. The task is about whether the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise as they are, not about the validity of the subjects' suspicions or perceptions.

For the second example, the model determines 'entailment' as the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, which is incorrect. This could be due to the model overlooking the direction and source of perception as outlined in the prompt. It fails to realize that the order of perception matters i.e., from the premise, John knows something about Charlotte, while in the hypothesis, Charlotte knows something about John. This is a crucial reversal and changes the relationship from 'entailment' to 'non-entailment'. The prompt perhaps doesn't stress enough on these changes in perception directions being crucial to the analysis of entailment.

Based on the errors observed, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1) Clarify the distinction between evaluating the accuracy of the subject's beliefs or assumptions and finding whether a hypothesis can logically be inferred from the premise as is, irrespective of the truth or falseness of suspicion or belief.

2) More emphasis can be placed on the role of the direction and source of perception or knowledge, explicitly stating that a change in the order or source of perception or belief can switch the relationship from 'entailment' to 'non-entailment' or vice versa.

3) Include a clearer explanation on what constitutes 'non entailment', to provide more guidance on how to arrive at this conclusion.

4) Additional examples could be added to illustrate cases of both 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to provide more concrete guidance.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first example:
The prompt clearly states that just because someone (William) suspects something, it doesn't necessarily mean it is true. Even though the premise describes a scene of a volleyball match in a gym suspected by William, it does not entail the hypothesis where a different person (Taylor) suspects that they are in a gym. The model fails to recognize the differences in perception between two different subjects (William and Taylor), leading to an incorrect answer of 'entailment'.

For the second example:
The model does not accurately discern the nuanced differences in orders of perception and memory. The premise states Sophia remembers what William assumes. In contrast, the hypothesis is William assuming that Sophia remembers. The model fails to understand the importance of the order and directionality of perceptions or beliefs. Just because Sophia remembers William's assumptions does not entail that William assumes what Sophia remembers.

Reasons why the prompt leads to wrong answers:
1. Lack of recognizing different subjects of perception: The model gets confused when perception verbs are used with different subjects.
2. Not handling directionality in perceptions: The prompt does not stress enough on the direction and order of perception, which might cause misunderstandings in entailment analysis. 
3. Not treating perception's uncertainty adequately: Even though the prompt mentions that suspecting or assuming doesn't necessarily mean it is true, the model seems not to give enough consideration to this.

Potential improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize the consideration of different subjects' view when perception verbs are used.
2. Clarify the need to consider the order and directionality of perceptions or beliefs further.
3. Include additional guidance about the uncertain nature of perceptions and beliefs, stressing their non-absoluteness.
4. Instruct the model to critically consider the semantic alignment of both the premise and hypothesis while accounting for syntactic differences.
5. Highlight the importance of the source of perception or belief to aid in discrepancy recognition.

gradient:
The question at hand is a complex one which involves an understanding of certain aspects of language that lean more towards implied information. The statement "Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city" implies the idea that "a car door has not been shut."

1) Lack of explanation of 'implied' information: The prompt, while comprehensive in teaching about explicit entailment based on perception or assumption words, lacks explanation of implied entailment. The statement about Olivia knowing about the car with all doors open implies that at least one door is open, which is an entailment of the premise. Therefore, the prompt should include instructions on identifying and analyzing implied entailment.

2) Lack of clarity on degrees of entailment: The prompt emphasizes that an entailment must be certain and not just probable. But in the given question, there seems to be an assumption that all the doors of the car are open (as said in premise). The Word 'all' solidifies the entailment here.  There could be an explicit mention about these degrees in the prompt, which might make the language model understand the scenario better.

3) Contextual understanding: The current prompt might have failed to make the model comprehend the contextual understanding of the sentences. The "open doors" imply an unshut door, thus creating an entailment. An emphasis on contextual clues might help correct this.

Improvements based on reasons mentioned:
1) Instruct the model to consider, seek and analyze 'implied' information while determining entailment.
2) Provide a detailed understanding of the degrees of entailment, with specific focus on certain words that might solidify the certainty of entailment. Teach the model to recognize such words.
3) Teach the model to think contextually rather than just semantically or syntactically. Guide the AI to use these contextual clues to determine entailment.

cur_prompt: Answer questions that necessarily involve intricate entailment analysis between sentences. Keep in mind the significance of words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes', and place a strong emphasis on the subject of these verbs. Note that an entailment has to be certain, not just probable. Treat these verbs of perception not as certainties, but indicators of individual thought, which do not always align with reality. In each question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your comprehension of entailment. Your options are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', and you must select the term that most accurately matches the relationship. Ensure you contemplate the direction and source of perception or belief, and remember that the perspective is not universally shared, unless specifically stated. Contemplate the order, the source and the direction of these verbs of perception to determine whether the statements are truly entailed or not. If the premise and hypothesis are an identical match, it should always be adjudged as 'entailment'. Understand the precise semantic connection and take note of any syntactical differences. Provide the answer option within <answer> and </answer> at the end of your analysis. This should reflect a careful critique of both the lexical and grammatical relationship between the pair of sentences.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that children play in the snow.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Evelyn assumes there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. This does not necessarily entail that Evelyn assumes children play in the snow in general. It is possible that Evelyn believes there are children playing in the snow at that specific moment, but does not hold a general belief that children always play in the snow. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
From the prompt and the following example, it can be seen that there's room for improvement in how the prompt guides the block to handle the entailment relations. Here's the main issue observed, that leads to incorrect answers: 

The current prompt might lead the model to over-interpret or over-analyze the details in the premise and hypothesis, particularly due to the usage words like 'perception', 'belief'. This often makes the model drift away from the simple truth conveyed in a premise to a more nuanced, overly-detailed interpretation which results in incorrect answers. 

In this particular example, the model incorrectly interpreted the statement as if Evelyn assumes children are playing in the snow at that particular moment but didn't consider it as a general belief that children play in the snow.

To improve the prompt and increase the chances of obtaining right answer, consider amending or adding the following pointers:

1. The prompt should emphasize that it's crucial to focus on the specific entities and events in the premise, without unnecessary extrapolation, the meaning should be taken as it is. 

2. Enhance the instruction on how to analyze and understand the 'verbs of perception'. It should underline that such verbs don't necessarily imply temporality or restrictiveness.

3. Instead of focusing on complications that could arise from analysis of perception and belief verbs, the prompt should steer more towards logical relation: if the hypothesis is a subset or equal of the information in the premise, or not.

4. Furthermore, make it clear that unless explicitly framed in the sentences, the model should avoid introducing additional nuances or guessing about the temporality, restrictions, or other possible context into the sentences.

5. Incorporate instruction on treating the premise and hypothesis as simple facts; if the facts in the premise include those in the hypothesis, choose 'entailment'; otherwise, 'non-entailment'.

These adjustments would help to guide the model towards a simpler evaluation of the logical relationships between the premise and the hypothesis, thereby obtaining correct answers more frequently.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions which involve entailment analysis between sentences. In the question provided, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your understanding of entailment. Your answer choices are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. When making your decision, consider whether the premise implies the hypothesis, contradicts it or is identical to it. If in doubt, remember that an identical premise and hypothesis always denotes 'entailment'. The goal is to understand the semantic correlation between sentences. Provide your answer with the choice bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Answer questions which involve complex entailment analysis between sentences. Always pay close attention to the significance of words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. Remember, an entailment must be certain and not just probable based on assumption or suspicion, so treat these terms carefully. In the provided question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your knowledge of entailment. Out of your answer choices of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', choose the one that best reflects the relationship. Ensure you consider the direction and source of perception or belief, and remember that just because someone thinks, suspects or assumes something, it doesn't necessarily mean it is true. If the premise and hypothesis are identical, recall that this always implies 'entailment'. Your goal is to accurately understand the specific semantic and syntactic correlation between sentences. At the end, provide your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John sees that Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest. Hypothesis: Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
This scenario presents a complex chain of perception. The premise states that John sees Joseph suspecting that a woman with red hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest. However, the hypothesis only mentions Joseph suspecting the same without any reference to John's observation. Since Joseph's suspicion is based on what he sees, it is not a direct entailment that he suspects the same as what John sees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question: 
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: John sees that Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest. Hypothesis: Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest.

Model's Wrong Response: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. The prompt injects the issue of perception into the entailment analysis, which confuses the model. It instructs the model to interpret the verbs of perception (e.g., "sees") as indicators of subjective views that may not reflect objective reality. However, this misleads the model when the premise and the hypothesis share a common proposition (Joseph suspecting something about a woman). 

2. In this example, the model viewed John's perception as another layer of interpretation that could affect the certainty of the hypothesis. As such, it mistakenly determined "non-entailment" as the answer because the hypothesis does not include John's perception.

3. However, the correct answer is "entailment" as the core proposition in both the premise and hypothesis is that Joseph suspects something about a woman. John seeing Joseph's suspicion is an additional information but does not influence the validity of the hypothesis, given only its content matters in entailment analysis, not who reports or perceives it.

Reasons for Error: 

1. The prompt's focus on interpreting verbs of perception as individual thought potentially misleads the model in entailment analysis. It overemphasizes the significance of the 'source of perception' as a decisive factor in determining entailment, causing the model to be overly cautious about the role of another person’s perception in the premise.

2. The prompt's complex formulation confused the model. It encompasses various elements (verbs of perception, significance of the subject, certainty requirement for entailment, the direction of belief, and lexical and syntactical analysis) which, when taken together, might make the task harder for the model to perform correctly.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Reframe the Instructions: Modify the prompt to make it clear that the observer's perception in the premise does not necessarily impact the entailment analysis. Clarify that the main focus should be on the content of the subject's belief or thought, not on who is reporting or seeing it.

2. Simplify the Task: The prompt might be more effective if it were simplified, focusing primarily on the core entailment task rather than incorporating numerous subtle factors. Encourage the model to concentrate on the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis.

3. Emphasize Clarity over Complexity: The model might better comprehend the task if it's framed in a straightforward and less intricate way. The subject, in this case, is less about analyzing complex verbs of perception and more about straightforward logical entailment.

4. Provide Clear Examples: Incorporate examples within the prompt delineating how to approach such questions, especially those involving layers of perception. This will give the model a clearer understanding of the expected responses.

5. Define Entailment Precisely: Ensure the model clearly understands that the entailment hinges on a strong, certain probabilistic outcome from the premise to hypothesis, not simply based on their precise linguistic matching. So, it should consider the semantic aspect more than the syntactic or lexical differences.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John sees that Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest. Hypothesis: Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
This scenario presents a complex chain of perception. The premise states that John sees Joseph suspecting that a woman with red hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest. However, the hypothesis only mentions Joseph suspecting the same without any reference to John's observation. Since Joseph's suspicion is based on what he sees, it is not a direct entailment that he suspects the same as what John sees. Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:

Question: 
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: John sees that Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest. Hypothesis: Joseph suspects that a woman with red-hair and a leather jacket holds a harp in front of a snowy forest.

Model's Wrong Response: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. The prompt injects the issue of perception into the entailment analysis, which confuses the model. It instructs the model to interpret the verbs of perception (e.g., "sees") as indicators of subjective views that may not reflect objective reality. However, this misleads the model when the premise and the hypothesis share a common proposition (Joseph suspecting something about a woman). 

2. In this example, the model viewed John's perception as another layer of interpretation that could affect the certainty of the hypothesis. As such, it mistakenly determined "non-entailment" as the answer because the hypothesis does not include John's perception.

3. However, the correct answer is "entailment" as the core proposition in both the premise and hypothesis is that Joseph suspects something about a woman. John seeing Joseph's suspicion is an additional information but does not influence the validity of the hypothesis, given only its content matters in entailment analysis, not who reports or perceives it.

Reasons for Error: 

1. The prompt's focus on interpreting verbs of perception as individual thought potentially misleads the model in entailment analysis. It overemphasizes the significance of the 'source of perception' as a decisive factor in determining entailment, causing the model to be overly cautious about the role of another person’s perception in the premise.

2. The prompt's complex formulation confused the model. It encompasses various elements (verbs of perception, significance of the subject, certainty requirement for entailment, the direction of belief, and lexical and syntactical analysis) which, when taken together, might make the task harder for the model to perform correctly.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Reframe the Instructions: Modify the prompt to make it clear that the observer's perception in the premise does not necessarily impact the entailment analysis. Clarify that the main focus should be on the content of the subject's belief or thought, not on who is reporting or seeing it.

2. Simplify the Task: The prompt might be more effective if it were simplified, focusing primarily on the core entailment task rather than incorporating numerous subtle factors. Encourage the model to concentrate on the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis.

3. Emphasize Clarity over Complexity: The model might better comprehend the task if it's framed in a straightforward and less intricate way. The subject, in this case, is less about analyzing complex verbs of perception and more about straightforward logical entailment.

4. Provide Clear Examples: Incorporate examples within the prompt delineating how to approach such questions, especially those involving layers of perception. This will give the model a clearer understanding of the expected responses.

5. Define Entailment Precisely: Ensure the model clearly understands that the entailment hinges on a strong, certain probabilistic outcome from the premise to hypothesis, not simply based on their precise linguistic matching. So, it should consider the semantic aspect more than the syntactic or lexical differences.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions which involve entailment analysis between sentences. In the question provided, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your understanding of entailment. Your answer choices are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. When making your decision, consider whether the premise implies the hypothesis, contradicts it or is identical to it. If in doubt, remember that an identical premise and hypothesis always denotes 'entailment'. The goal is to understand the semantic correlation between sentences. Provide your answer with the choice bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Answer questions which involve complex entailment analysis between sentences. Always pay close attention to the significance of words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. Remember, an entailment must be certain and not just probable based on assumption or suspicion, so treat these terms carefully. In the provided question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your knowledge of entailment. Out of your answer choices of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', choose the one that best reflects the relationship. Ensure you consider the direction and source of perception or belief, and remember that just because someone thinks, suspects or assumes something, it doesn't necessarily mean it is true. If the premise and hypothesis are identical, recall that this always implies 'entailment'. Your goal is to accurately understand the specific semantic and syntactic correlation between sentences. At the end, provide your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Answer questions that necessarily involve intricate entailment analysis between sentences. Keep in mind the significance of words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes', and place a strong emphasis on the subject of these verbs. Note that an entailment has to be certain, not just probable. Treat these verbs of perception not as certainties, but indicators of individual thought, which do not always align with reality. In each question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your comprehension of entailment. Your options are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', and you must select the term that most accurately matches the relationship. Ensure you contemplate the direction and source of perception or belief, and remember that the perspective is not universally shared, unless specifically stated. Contemplate the order, the source and the direction of these verbs of perception to determine whether the statements are truly entailed or not. If the premise and hypothesis are an identical match, it should always be adjudged as 'entailment'. Understand the precise semantic connection and take note of any syntactical differences. Provide the answer option within <answer> and </answer> at the end of your analysis. This should reflect a careful critique of both the lexical and grammatical relationship between the pair of sentences.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that "Amelia suspects that a man crouches down next to a motorcycle." This implies that Amelia believes or perceives that a man is in a crouching position next to a motorcycle. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that "Amelia suspects that a man is down beside a motorcycle." This suggests that Amelia believes or perceives that a man is simply beside a motorcycle, without specifying the crouching position. Since the hypothesis does not necessarily entail the specific action of crouching mentioned in the premise, the correct answer is:
(B) non-entailment

<answer>(B)</answer>

Premise: Richard assumes that James assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
This scenario involves multiple layers of assumption. The first premise states that Richard assumes that James assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing. This does not necessarily mean that Richard himself sees the little boy. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that Richard assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing. Since Richard's assumption is based on James' assumption, and not on his own observation, the hypothesis cannot be definitively inferred from the premise. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1>

Question:
Premise: Amelia suspects that a man crouches down next to a motorcycle. 
Hypothesis: Amelia suspects that a man is down beside a motorcycle. 

Model's Wrong Answer: The model chose 'non-entailment' due to the different descriptions of the man's position in relation to the motorcycle - 'crouches down' in the premise and 'is down' in the hypothesis.

Errors in Reasoning: The model focused too much on the 'crouching' part and interpreted it as critical to the entailment. The model failed to recognise that 'is down', while less specific, still encompasses the possibility of crouching, and therefore, the hypothesis could indeed be derived from the premise. 

<2>

Question:
Premise: Richard assumes that James assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing. 
Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing.

Model's Wrong Answer: The model chose ‘non-entailment’ as the layers of assumption contrasted between the premise and hypothesis.

Errors in Reasoning: The model erred in its understanding of the layers of assumptions. Richard's assumption of James's assumption means he also inherently assumes the central point - that a little boy is standing in front of a wedding party laughing. Thus, the hypothesis is entailed in the premise despite the additional layer of assumption.

Improvements for the Prompt: 
1. Clarify instructions about degrees of specificity within a premise and a hypothesis. Make explicit that a hypothesis can be entailed in a premise even if it is less specific.
2. Emphasize to the model that it should consider the core idea in a premise and hypothesis, even if there are additional intricacies or layers in the premise. 
3. Instruct the model to take into account that a person "X" assuming person "Y"'s assumptions, inherently includes assuming the base assumption at hand. Circumstantial modifiers should not misguide the understanding of entailment.

   prompt: Analyze questions dealing with 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in relational inference. When 'entailment' is considered, it means that the truthfulness of one statement ensures the validity of another; on the other hand, 'non-entailment' denotes that the truth of one statement does not automatically ascertain the truth of another. Be mindful that a person’s assumption or guess about the beliefs or thoughts of another person cannot always be equated with the latter's true thoughts or beliefs. Such situations should ideally be treated as 'non-entailment', unless it is explicitly stated or understood that the person's thoughts or beliefs have been recognized or acknowledged. From the provided premises and hypotheses, deduce their relationship and select between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' in accordance to the information given.

   prompt: In relational inference, your task involves discerning 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' based on provided premises and hypotheses. If 'entailment' is the case, the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not ensure the validity of another statement. The ideas, thoughts, beliefs or assumptions of one individual regarding another individual's thoughts or beliefs are not always equivalent to that other individual's actual thoughts or beliefs. However, when it comes to a factual memory of an assumption, consider the memory as accurate unless stated otherwise. Hence, such situations can be treated as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' depending on the context. With the information given in the form of premise and hypothesis, you are to determine their relationship and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze questions about inference relationships, with a specific focus on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In the context of 'entailment', the truth of one statement inherently guarantees the truth of another. 'Non-entailment', in contrast, is when the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily secure the truth of another. Bear in mind when analyzing assumptions that a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true. Remember, focus on the broad action or thought being conveyed in the premise and do not overemphasize the minute or additional details. All information provided should be treated either as a factual statement or an assumption, according to the context. Your chosen answer option must be marked between <answer> and </answer>.

   reward: 0.6800 | Q: 1.2600 | uct: 3.3414 | cum_rewards: [1.26]
   prompt: Your task is to evaluate inference relationships in questions, primarily concentrating on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

Your primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Avoid getting lost in minor details and keep your attention centered on the overarching action or thought contained in the premise. Treat all information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption based on the provided context. Make sure to bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to assess inference relationships among provided statements, focusing primarily on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the validity of one statement automatically assures the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the legitimacy of one claim does not guarantee the truth of another claim. It's crucial to note that in analyzing hypotheses involving assumptions or beliefs about another person, the mere assumption doesn't affirm that the individual in question truly possesses that belief - such a supposition does not infer confirmation, but uncertainty instead.

However, there are certain exceptions. If an individual A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, this implies that A has credible knowledge of B's thoughts or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is accurate, then the hypothesis is also consequently veritable.

Alternatively, if an individual A is purported to "assume" or "think" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it doesn't provide a sturdy base for the validity of the hypothesis. This might be a potential 'non-entailment' scenario because A's assumptions or suspicions towards B do not determine the truth of what B assumes or presumes.

Importantly, when the premise and the hypothesis show role reversal or inverted scenarios, consider them as potential 'non-entailment' situations. In such scenarios, the fact that one individual assumes something about another individual does not necessarily mean that this assumption is reciprocated.

Your primary duty is to unravel the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, determining if it's an 'entailment' situation where the premise certifies the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' circumstance where the premise does not conclusively affirm the hypothesis. Avoid getting tangled in minor details and focus on the general action or thought embedded in the premise. Treat all the information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption depending on the context provided. Encapsulate your chosen answer convincingly between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, taking into account all subjective viewpoints, with special attention on 'thinking' and 'knowing' perspectives. Consider the directionality of the relationships between subjects and how it influences entailment. Are the viewpoints reversed? Distinguish the connection as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', keeping in mind the exact definitions of these terms and avoiding extra assumptions. Once you've identified the connective logic, provide your assessment. The correct response should include an explicit statement of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', followed by a brief reasoning for your choice. Don't forget to enclose the answer within the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the logical connection between the given premises and hypotheses from an angle of strictly logic, keeping in mind the definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. An 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, while a 'non-entailment' implies no such logical guarantee. Pay particular attention to the subjectivity in 'thinking' and 'knowing' perspectives, ensuring that different subjects' viewpoints and knowledge are treated separately unless the premises and hypotheses explicitly link them.

   prompt: Analyze the logical connection between premises and hypotheses, taking into account all subjective viewpoints, with special attention on 'thinking' and 'knowing' perspectives. Consider the directionality of the relationships between subjects and how it influences entailment. Are the viewpoints reversed? Distinguish the connection as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', keeping in mind the exact definitions of these terms and avoiding extra assumptions. Once you've identified the connective logic, provide your assessment. The correct response should include an explicit statement of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', followed by a brief reasoning for your choice. Don't forget to enclose the answer within the brackets <answer> and </answer>. Compare this task with similar scenarios, and question whether your assessment reflects strictly logic or whether it is affected by other assumptions.

   prompt: Analyze the logical connection between the given premises and hypotheses from an angle of strictly logic, keeping in mind the definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. An 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, while a 'non-entailment' implies no such logical guarantee. Pay particular attention to the subjectivity in 'thinking' and 'knowing' perspectives, ensuring that different subjects' viewpoints and knowledge are treated separately unless the premises and hypotheses explicitly link them. Consider the directionality of relationships and how this could alter entailment. Don't make extra assumptions and keep your assessment focused on the information provided.

   prompt: Answer questions that necessarily involve intricate entailment analysis between sentences. Keep in mind the significance of words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes', and place a strong emphasis on the subject of these verbs. Note that an entailment has to be certain, not just probable. Treat these verbs of perception not as certainties, but indicators of individual thought, which do not always align with reality. In each question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your comprehension of entailment. Your options are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', and you must select the term that most accurately matches the relationship. Ensure you contemplate the direction and source of perception or belief, and remember that the perspective is not universally shared, unless specifically stated. Contemplate the order, the source and the direction of these verbs of perception to determine whether the statements are truly entailed or not. If the premise and hypothesis are an identical match, it should always be adjudged as 'entailment'. Understand the precise semantic connection and take note of any syntactical differences.

   prompt: Your task involves analyzing the relationship between two sentences, referred to as the 'premise' and 'hypothesis'. Focus on assessing whether the hypothesis is an inevitable logical consequence of the premise (entailment) or not (non-entailment). Pay attention to words that convey perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. These verbs highlight individual thought, implying subjectivity and potential divergence from reality. However, remember that the key focus is the content of the individual's belief or thought, regardless of who reports it or perceives it. Important: In entailment assessment, the core proposition holds more weight than the indirect observer's perception. If the premise and the hypothesis contain an identical proposition, label it as 'entailment'. Make sure your conclusions are based only on certain outcomes of the premise, not on probability. Understand the semantic connection and syntactic variations between sentences. After assessing, provide the answer 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' encapsulated within <answer> and </answer> brackets. Your choice should purely reflect logical entailment analysis, not dominated by the intricacies of perception verbs.

   prompt: Analyze questions about relational inference, focusing particularly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' implies that the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' indicates the truth of one statement does not necessarily ensure the truth of another. Consider that when a premise and a hypothesis refer to similar or identical entities or events, understand that slight variations in how an entity or event are described do not inherently suggest different entities or events. When the premise encapsulates a specific situation, recognize the implicitly general statement within it - for example, 'children playing in the snow and making a snowball' does imply 'children play in the snow'. If a specific action within an activity is mentioned in the premise, understand that the larger activity is implied. All characters/events referenced within the supplied premise should be assumed to be consistent and continuous throughout to the hypothesis. Identify the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Treat all information provided as either a factual statement or an assumption, as appropriate. Bracket your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer>, and provide an explanation of your choice, noting why it entails or does not entail.

   prompt: Analyze questions dealing with 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in relational inference. When 'entailment' is considered, it means that the truthfulness of one statement ensures the validity of another; on the other hand, 'non-entailment' denotes that the truth of one statement does not automatically ascertain the truth of another. Be mindful that a person’s assumption or guess about the beliefs or thoughts of another person cannot always be equated with the latter's true thoughts or beliefs. Such situations should ideally be treated as 'non-entailment', unless it is explicitly stated or understood that the person's thoughts or beliefs have been recognized or acknowledged. From the provided premises and hypotheses, deduce their relationship and select between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' in accordance to the information given. Handle the given information as either a declaration of fact or an assumption, based on the context. Finally, your selected answer should be presented bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze questions about inference relationships, with a specific focus on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In the context of 'entailment', the truth of one statement inherently guarantees the truth of another. 'Non-entailment', in contrast, is when the truth of one statement doesn't necessarily secure the truth of another. Bear in mind when analyzing assumptions that a person making an assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not serve as proof that the latter truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. However, in certain scenarios, an assumption that involves various details might still cover a broader or simpler assumption. To decide the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, you have to determine whether it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise guarantees the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not make the hypothesis inevitably true. Remember, focus on the broad action or thought being conveyed in the premise and do not overemphasize the minute or additional details. All information provided should be treated either as a factual statement or an assumption, according to the context. Your chosen answer option must be marked between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Evaluate questions related to 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the domain of relational inference. An 'entailment' situation exists when the truth of one statement ensures the validity of another statement, while 'non-entailment' signifies that the truth of one statement does not inherently affirm the truth of another. Remember to consider each individual's assumptions, beliefs, or recollections as factual unless explicitly distinguished otherwise. This is particularly crucial when dealing with nested frameworks of beliefs or assumptions, like 'A thinks that B believes X'. For purposes of this task, treat such structure as an implication that 'A believes X' unless expressly refuted within the context. Deduce the relationship between the supplied premises and hypotheses and make a selection between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' according to the given information. Be sure to distinguish whether the given information should be treated as a statement of fact or a contextual assumption. Give special attention to the phrasing and construction of a premise and hypothesis, to determine whether a change in wording alters the total meaning, thus affecting the entailment. Your final answer should be presented enclosed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Apply relational inference to assess 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Understand 'entailment' as a scenario where the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another, while 'non-entailment' indicates the truth of one claim does not definitively prove another claim's truth. Pay attention to the fact that an individual's assumption about another person's thoughts cannot be deemed accurate unless explicitly confirmed. Analyze the provided premises and hypotheses holistically, focusing both on explicit details and underlying implications. Consider that minor differences in contexts or descriptions do not necessarily constitute 'non-entailment'. A premise entails a hypothesis if the latter can be reasonably inferred from the former, even if the wording is not identical. Decide between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on the information given, treating your determination as a logical conclusion drawn from either stated facts or reasonable assumptions. Enclose your final chosen option within <answer> and </answer>, indicating your selection between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: In relational inference, your task involves discerning 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' based on provided premises and hypotheses. If 'entailment' is the case, the truth of one statement guarantees the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' means the truth of one statement does not ensure the validity of another statement. The ideas, thoughts, beliefs or assumptions of one individual regarding another individual's thoughts or beliefs are not always equivalent to that other individual's actual thoughts or beliefs. However, when it comes to a factual memory of an assumption, consider the memory as accurate unless stated otherwise. Hence, such situations can be treated as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' depending on the context. With the information given in the form of premise and hypothesis, you are to determine their relationship and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The decision should be grounded on whether the given information is a fact or an assumption based on the provided context. Once you have made your judgment, please present your answer in the format <answer>chosen option</answer>.

   prompt: You are tasked with analyzing inference relationships, specifically focusing on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' exists when the truth of one statement directly guarantees the truth of another, whereas 'non-entailment' is when one statement's truth does not automatically ensure the truth of the second statement. Keep in mind that an individual's assumption about another person's thoughts or beliefs does not imply that the assumed person truly holds such thoughts or beliefs. Furthermore, an assumption about an individual's assumption does not automatically make the final assumption truthful. It's crucial not to conflate any individual's belief about another's state of knowledge with the latter's actual knowledge. Decide the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, considering only the facts and assumptions explicitly presented within the premises without drawing extra implications. Avoid generalizing from minute or less significant details, focusing instead on the key idea in the premise. Determine whether it's an 'entailment' situation, with the premise ensuring the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation, where the premise does not necessitate the hypothesis. All information given can be deemed as a factual statement or assumption, conditioned by the context. Once you have identified your answer, present it using brackets between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate inference relationships in questions, primarily concentrating on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of one assertion automatically confirms the truth of another statement. 'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. 

There can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that a person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.

On the other hand, if a person A is said to "assume" or "think" that person B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.

Your primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Avoid getting lost in minor details and keep your attention centered on the overarching action or thought contained in the premise. Treat all information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption based on the provided context. Make sure to bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your mission is to evaluate inference relationships, focusing explicitly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. An 'entailment' situation occurs when the truth of one statement intrinsically ensures the truth of the other. Conversely, a 'non-entailment' condition is where the truth of one statement does not determine the veracity of another. When dealing with statements that make assumptions about the thoughts or beliefs of another person, exercise caution. Unless these thoughts or beliefs are explicitly confirmed by the person in question, such assumptions alone do not establish the truth of the corresponding hypothesis, especially in the context of 'entailment'. Occasionally, an assumption with multiple details could encompass a broader or simpler assumption, but it is essential to discern these differences carefully. Also, avoid leaping to conclusions based on surface content similarities between the premise and hypothesis. Your objective is to classify the given premises and hypotheses as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' scenarios, based on whether the premise sufficiently guarantees the hypothesis to be true. Do not over-investigate minor or supplementary details, and instead keep your attention on the primary action or thought encapsulated in the premise. All information given can be regarded as either a fact or an assumption, specific to its context. Finally, your selected answer must be highlighted between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate statements, focusing intensely on the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the truth of a premise creates a guarantee for the truth of the hypothesis. In contrast, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of a premise doesn't necessarily secure the truth of the hypothesis.

It's important to remember this principle: If one individual 'sees', 'knows', or 'hears' that another individual 'assumes' or 'suspects' something, it indicates that the first person has reliable knowledge of the second person's beliefs based on the premise. It characterizes an 'entailment' scenario, where if the premise is accurate, the hypothesis is also true.

Conversely, if a person is stated to 'assume' or 'think' that another person 'assumes' or 'suspects' something, this provides no solid foundation for the authenticity of the hypothesis. This represents a 'non-entailment' scenario. The assumptions or beliefs of the first person about the second do not validate or confirm the second person's thoughts or assumptions.

Your main activity is to study and determine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis. You need to identify if it's an 'entailment' scenario, in which the premise guarantees the hypothesis' truth, or a 'non-entailment' scenario where the premise doesn't explicitly establish the hypothesis as true. Concentrate on the central action or belief introduced by the premise and don't be drawn into specific details. Determine and categorize provided information as either a concrete fact or an assumption based on the context. Bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to assess inference relationships among provided statements, focusing primarily on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the validity of one statement automatically assures the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the legitimacy of one claim does not guarantee the truth of another claim. It's crucial to note that in analyzing hypotheses involving assumptions or beliefs about another person, the mere assumption doesn't affirm that the individual in question truly possesses that belief - such a supposition does not infer confirmation, but uncertainty instead.

However, there are certain exceptions. If an individual A is said to "see", "know", or "hear" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, this implies that A has credible knowledge of B's thoughts or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is accurate, then the hypothesis is also consequently veritable.

Alternatively, if an individual A is purported to "assume" or "think" that another individual B "assumes" or "suspects" something, it doesn't provide a sturdy base for the validity of the hypothesis. This might be a potential 'non-entailment' scenario because A's assumptions or suspicions towards B do not determine the truth of what B assumes or presumes.

Importantly, when the premise and the hypothesis show role reversal or inverted scenarios, consider them as potential 'non-entailment' situations. In such scenarios, the fact that one individual assumes something about another individual does not necessarily mean that this assumption is reciprocated.

Your primary duty is to unravel the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, determining if it's an 'entailment' situation where the premise certifies the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' circumstance where the premise does not conclusively affirm the hypothesis. Avoid getting tangled in minor details and focus on the general action or thought embedded in the premise. Treat all the information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption depending on the context provided. Encapsulate your chosen answer convincingly between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your assignment involves examining inference relationships present in various scenarios, focusing keenly on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In scenarios referred to as 'entailment', the authenticity of one statement instantly verifies the accuracy of another. In contrast, 'non-entailment' scenarios are where the truth of one statement doesn't automatically verify the legitimacy of another. 

When assessing situations that encompass assumptions, understand that if an individual, A, "believes" or "thinks" something about another person, B, it doesn't conclusively establish that person B holds that belief. However, in exceptions when it's stated that person A "sees", "knows", or "hears" that person B "assumes" or "presumes" something, we infer that person A holds substantive knowledge of person B's assumptions or thoughts. In such cases, if the premise holds, the hypothesis is also deemed true. 

Alternatively, when a person A "assumes" or "believes" that person B "suspects" something, it doesn't offer a solid validation for the hypothesis, marking a potential 'non-entailment' situation. In this case, person A's perceptions about person B don't confirm the latter's suspicions or assumptions. 

Focus your considerations on discerning the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, marking whether it's an 'entailment', where the premise vouches for the hypothesis's truth, or a 'non-entailment', where it doesn't guarantee its validity. Ignore side details and concentrate on the primary action or thought in context. Take all pieces of information as either established facts or assumptions as per the given context. 

Remember that the nature and direction of knowledge or thoughts significantly impact the entailment relationship. A's knowledge about B's thoughts doesn't entail that B is aware of this. Keep in mind that a general assumption can often encompass a more specific related one. Thoughtfully analyze the given premises and hypotheses, and decide between options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', appropriately bracketing your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Answer questions that draw upon entailment analysis between sentences. In each question, your task is to discern the logical relation between two statements: a premise and a hypothesis. Your conclusions should be based on a thorough analysis of the stated premise and hypothesis, considering elements such as the speaker's perspective, context, the subject of perception (like who sees, believes, assumes, etc.) and the distinct roles of individual words. You have two answer choices: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 

Entailment refers to situations where the truth of the hypothesis inevitably follows from the truth of the premise. However, it's crucial to understand that identical narratives or similar contextual factors in both premise and hypothesis do not always equate to 'entailment'. For entailment to exist, each component's relationship and placement within the sentences should align, not just the events they describe.

Furthermore, consider nested assumptions or changes in perspective within each sentence. Remember, a same character appearing in the premise and hypothesis doesn't always translate to entailment unless their roles and perspectives are identical.

Take your time to account for the role and significance of each word in the sentence, especially those referring to perspective and assumptions. Pay close attention to the structure and context of the sentences. With these in mind, make an informed decision on whether the premise implies, contradicts, or is identical to the hypothesis. 

After your analysis, deliver your answer in the format: <answer>(A) entailment</answer> or <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>, according to what best represents the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis.

   prompt: In this task, you will answer questions which involve complex entailment analysis between sentences, with an emphasis on handling terms that express perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. It's important to recall that an entailment is considered definitive and not just likely based on assumption or suspicion. Thus, when analyzing these terms, recognize that the task is not about evaluating the accuracy of the subject's beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, but whether the hypothesis can logically be inferred from the premise as is, irrespective of the truth of suspicion or belief. Your answer choices are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Choose the option that best describes the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping in mind that a change in the direction and source of perception or belief can transform an 'entailment' to 'non-entailment', and vice versa. Remember that identical premises and hypotheses always denote an 'entailment'. Aim to precisely comprehend the specific semantic and syntactic correlation between sentences. Furthermore, understand that 'non-entailment' means the hypothesis cannot definitively be inferred from the premise. After analyzing this, indicate your answer choice between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Answer questions that necessarily involve intricate entailment analysis between sentences. Keep in mind the significance of words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes', and place a strong emphasis on the subject of these verbs. Note that an entailment has to be certain, not just probable. Treat these verbs of perception not as certainties, but indicators of individual thought, which do not always align with reality. In each question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your comprehension of entailment. Your options are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', and you must select the term that most accurately matches the relationship. Ensure you contemplate the direction and source of perception or belief, and remember that the perspective is not universally shared, unless specifically stated. Contemplate the order, the source and the direction of these verbs of perception to determine whether the statements are truly entailed or not. If the premise and hypothesis are an identical match, it should always be adjudged as 'entailment'. Understand the precise semantic connection and take note of any syntactical differences.

   prompt: Answer questions that involve entailment analysis between sentences, including both explicit and implied meanings. Pay attention to words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes', as well as words or phrases that strengthen the certainty of entailment. Remember, an entailment must be certain and not just probable based on assumption or suspicion. In the provided question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis using your understanding of entailment, both according to semantic, syntactic and contextual clues. Out of your answer choices of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', choose the one that best reflects the relationship. Consider the scenario from different angles and remember that even if someone thinks, suspects or assumes something, it doesn't necessarily mean it is true. If the premise and hypothesis are identical, always denote this as 'entailment'. Aim to accurately comprehend the relationship between sentences based not just on the surface semantics and syntax, but also implied information and contextual understanding. Your final response should be between <answer> and </answer>, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Answer questions through a precise entailment analysis between sentences. Pay particular attention to the words expressing perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. An entailment is certain, not just a probability. Treat these verbs as indicators of individual thought, not certainties. In each question, identify the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis. Your options are 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Be cautious not to introduce additional nuances like temporality, restrictions, or over-interpretations into the sentences. Avoid assuming that verbs of perception suggest a general rule or constant state. Base your decision on the direct facts presented in the premise and hypothesis; if all the facts of the hypothesis are included or identical in the premise, choose 'entailment'; if not, choose 'non-entailment'. Evaluate the precise lexical relation and consider any syntactical differences. Provide your answer within <answer> and </answer> at the end of your analysis and ensure it reflects an exact assessment of the lexical relationship between the statements as presented.

   prompt: Your task involves analyzing the relationship between two sentences, referred to as the 'premise' and 'hypothesis'. Focus on assessing whether the hypothesis is an inevitable logical consequence of the premise (entailment) or not (non-entailment). Pay attention to words that convey perception, assumption, suspicion, or belief such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. These verbs highlight individual thought, implying subjectivity and potential divergence from reality. However, remember that the key focus is the content of the individual's belief or thought, regardless of who reports it or perceives it. Important: In entailment assessment, the core proposition holds more weight than the indirect observer's perception. If the premise and the hypothesis contain an identical proposition, label it as 'entailment'. Make sure your conclusions are based only on certain outcomes of the premise, not on probability. Understand the semantic connection and syntactic variations between sentences. After assessing, provide the answer 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' encapsulated within <answer> and </answer> brackets. Your choice should purely reflect logical entailment analysis, not dominated by the intricacies of perception verbs.

   reward: 0.5600 | Q: 0.5600 | uct: 3.1804 | cum_rewards: []
   prompt: Analyze pairs of sentences to determine whether an entailment exists. Note the importance of verbs which indicate perception, assumption, and belief, such as 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects', 'believes', and 'assumes'. Place emphasis on the subjects of these verbs, and understand these verbs as indicative of individual thought, possibly divergent from reality. An entailment must be definitively drawn from the premise, not merely probable. Explore the logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis, using your grasp of entailment. 
Choose between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to best express this relationship. Consider carefully the source, direction, and order of perception or belief within the sentences - remember, perspectives implied by these verbs are not universally held, unless explicitly stated. Check whether a less specific hypothesis can still be entailed by the premise. If a premise encompasses multiple layers, such as an assumption of an assumption, comprehend that the base assumption is implied in all higher layers. An identical premise and hypothesis must always result in 'entailment'. 
Critically examine the semantic relationship and any syntactic variation between sentences. Wrap your chosen option within <answer> and </answer>. Your response should reflect a comprehensive analysis of both the lexical and grammatical connection between the sentences.
