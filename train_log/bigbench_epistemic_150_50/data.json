In 'entailment' scenarios, the validity of one statement automatically assures the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the legitimacy of one claim does not guarantee the truth of another claim. It's crucial to note that in analyzing hypotheses involving assumptions or beliefs about another person, the mere assumption doesn't affirm that the individual in question truly possesses that belief - such a supposition does not infer confirmation, but uncertainty instead.\n\nHowever, there are certain exceptions. If an individual A is said to \"see\", \"know\", or \"hear\" that another individual B \"assumes\" or \"suspects\" something, this implies that A has credible knowledge of B's thoughts or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is accurate, then the hypothesis is also consequently veritable.\n\nAlternatively, if an individual A is purported to \"assume\" or \"think\" that another individual B \"assumes\" or \"suspects\" something, it doesn't provide a sturdy base for the validity of the hypothesis. This might be a potential 'non-entailment' scenario because A's assumptions or suspicions towards B do not determine the truth of what B assumes or presumes.\n\nImportantly, when the premise and the hypothesis show role reversal or inverted scenarios, consider them as potential 'non-entailment' situations. In such scenarios, the fact that one individual assumes something about another individual does not necessarily mean that this assumption is reciprocated.\n\nYour primary duty is to unravel the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, determining if it's an 'entailment' situation where the premise certifies the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' circumstance where the premise does not conclusively affirm the hypothesis.

'Non-entailment' scenarios are those where the validity of one statement does not assure the truth of another statement. When analyzing hypotheses that involve assumptions, it's important to note that the fact that one individual assumes or thinks something about another person doesn't establish that the second person actually holds that belief - such an assumption does not offer proof but is open to doubt. \n\nThere can be exceptions, however. For instance, if a person A is said to \"see\", \"know\", or \"hear\" that a person B \"assumes\" or \"suspects\" something, it implies that person A has reliable knowledge of person B's assumptions or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also consequently true.\n\nOn the other hand, if a person A is said to \"assume\" or \"think\" that person B \"assumes\" or \"suspects\" something, it provides no solid ground for the truth of the hypothesis. This is potentially a 'non-entailment' scenario because Person A's assumptions or beliefs about Person B doesn't determine the validity of what Person B assumes or suspects.\n\nYour primary task is to discern the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, deciding if it's an 'entailment' scenario where the premise ensures the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' situation where the premise does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. Avoid getting lost in minor details and keep your attention centered on the overarching action or thought contained in the premise. Treat all information as either a confirmed fact or an assumption based on the provided context. Make sure to bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.",

                "prompt": "Your task is to assess inference relationships among provided statements, focusing primarily on 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. In 'entailment' scenarios, the validity of one statement automatically assures the truth of another statement. Conversely, 'non-entailment' scenarios are those where the legitimacy of one claim does not guarantee the truth of another claim. It's crucial to note that in analyzing hypotheses involving assumptions or beliefs about another person, the mere assumption doesn't affirm that the individual in question truly possesses that belief - such a supposition does not infer confirmation, but uncertainty instead.\n\nHowever, there are certain exceptions. If an individual A is said to \"see\", \"know\", or \"hear\" that another individual B \"assumes\" or \"suspects\" something, this implies that A has credible knowledge of B's thoughts or suspicions. In this scenario, if the premise is accurate, then the hypothesis is also consequently veritable.\n\nAlternatively, if an individual A is purported to \"assume\" or \"think\" that another individual B \"assumes\" or \"suspects\" something, it doesn't provide a sturdy base for the validity of the hypothesis. This might be a potential 'non-entailment' scenario because A's assumptions or suspicions towards B do not determine the truth of what B assumes or presumes.\n\nImportantly, when the premise and the hypothesis show role reversal or inverted scenarios, consider them as potential 'non-entailment' situations. In such scenarios, the fact that one individual assumes something about another individual does not necessarily mean that this assumption is reciprocated.\n\nYour primary duty is to unravel the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, determining if it's an 'entailment' situation where the premise certifies the truth of the hypothesis, or a 'non-entailment' circumstance where the premise does not conclusively affirm the hypothesis.

You have two answer choices: 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. \n\nEntailment refers to situations where the truth of the hypothesis inevitably follows from the truth of the premise. However, it's crucial to understand that identical narratives or similar contextual factors in both premise and hypothesis do not always equate to 'entailment'. For entailment to exist, each component's relationship and placement within the sentences should align, not just the events they describe.\n\nFurthermore, consider nested assumptions or changes in perspective within each sentence. Remember, a same character appearing in the premise and hypothesis doesn't always translate to entailment unless their roles and perspectives are identical.\n\nTake your time to account for the role and significance of each word in the sentence, especially those referring to perspective and assumptions. Pay close attention to the structure and context of the sentences. With these in mind, make an informed decision on whether the premise implies, contradicts, or is identical to the hypothesis. \n\nAfter your analysis, deliver your answer in the format: <answer>(A) entailment</answer> or <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>, according to what best represents the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis.",

Pay particular attention to the subjectivity in 'thinking' and 'knowing' perspectives, ensuring that different subjects' viewpoints and knowledge are treated separately unless the premises and hypotheses explicitly link them. Consider the directionality of relationships and how this could alter entailment. Don't make extra assumptions and keep your assessment focused on the information provided. Once you've worked through the logic, state your findings: does the premise entail the hypothesis, or not? Include this as an explicit statement of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' followed by a concise explanation for your decision. Enclose your response within the brackets <answer> and </answer>. Finally, compare your findings with similar exercises and reason out if your conclusion is logic-based or affected by other factors like assumptions or biases. Always bear in mind the unique attributes of each entailment scenario as you explore.",
