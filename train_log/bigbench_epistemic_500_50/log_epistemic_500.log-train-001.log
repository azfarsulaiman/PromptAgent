I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava thinks that Thomas thinks that the Sooner football player carrying the ball is trying to avoid being tackled. Hypothesis: Thomas thinks that the Sooner football player carrying the ball is trying to avoid being tackled.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Wrong Answer: The relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

Correct Label: B
Model's Prediction: A

Reason for the Wrong Answer:

1. Ambiguity in the prompt: The main issue with the prompt is ambiguity. The task mentioned in the prompt is to "Answer questions about causal attribution," which is different from the task in the example. The example instead asks to assess the relation between a premise and a hypothesis - determining entailment or non-entailment. This concept is closer to logic or reasoning, rather than causal attribution.

2. Lack of instruction clarity: Another reason for the incorrect response could be due to a lack of clarity in the instructions. There's no clear guidance for the model to decide if it should use common sense or real-world knowledge, or just focus on provided information.

3. Missing specific task context: The prompt fails to provide a context which is crucial for the model to answer questions on complex cognitive concepts like entailment.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Task Specificity: The prompt should explicitly ask the model to evaluate the logical connection between the given premise and hypothesis in terms of ‘entailment’ or ‘non-entailment’. This will help set the correct context.

2. Guiding Instructions: It should provide clear instructions about the criteria for determining entailment or non-entailment. The prompt might need to instruct the model to assess whether the information in the hypothesis can be inferred directly from the information in the premise.

3. Minimize Ambiguity: Avoid using general terms like "causal attribution" and instead use more specific language relevant to the task.

Improved Prompt: "Analyse the logical connection between a given premise and hypothesis and identify the relation as either 'entailment' if the hypothesis can be inferred from the premise, or 'non-entailment' if it cannot be."

The model's response is:

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Correct Label: A

Reason: This error occurred because the prompt being used does not provide clear instructions for the model about which aspects of the sentences it should focus on to determine entailment. In this case, the model overlooks the indicator in the premise that children are part of the group looking at something, which results in a mismatch between the correct answer and the model's prediction. 

Based on this analysis, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:
1. Introduce more specification to guide the model's attention towards valuable information in the sentence, such as details or phrases that directly support or refute the hypothesis.
2. Explicitly instruct the model to consider all segments of the premise sentence and not to neglect any part of it while determining the relation.
3. It might be worth instructing the model to individually assess the relationship between each component of the premise and the hypothesis before making the final choice.
4. Prompt could direct the model to use reasoning abilities to logically connect or disconnect premise and hypothesis for determining entailing or non-entailment.
5. Include instructions for the model to consider the context, potential inferences, and logical consistency while evaluating the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

gradient:
Example 1: 

Step by Step Review:
- The task requires the model to identify the causal relation between two statements, specifically with regards to 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
- The premise talks about a man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open.
- The hypothesis mentions that a man is jumping. This can be seen as an extraction or simplification of one part of the premise. 
- Therefore, the hypothesis naturally follows from the premise (entailment).

Wrong Answer Analysis:
- The model predicted non-entailment, which means it did not recognize that the events mentioned in the hypothesis are part of the premise.
- This could be due to the complexity of the premise that might have caused the model to miss the entailment relation.

Example 2: 

Step by Step Review:
- This task similarly requires the model to interpret the causal relation between two statements, looking for 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
- Analyzing both statements, it can be seen that they are nearly identical with the main difference being that the premise includes "Thomas believes."
- Therefore, the hypothesis doesn't necessarily follow from the premise, and non-entailment should be the correct choice.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
- The model incorrectly chose 'entailment', unable to distinguish that the belief of a person does not guarantee the understanding of another person.
- This could suggest the model has difficulty in handling nuances within language, particularly those involving abstract concepts like belief, understanding, or inference.

Based on these reviews, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

- Clarify the definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to ensure that the model understands the nature of the task clearly.
- Emphasize the importance of looking at the nuanced details within each statement, including contextual clues and abstract concepts.
- Explicitly ask the model to observe if the events or assumptions in the hypothesis are directly present in the premise or not.
- Augment the training data with more examples that feature various levels of complexity, such as multi-clause sentences and sentences involving abstract reasoning.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella suspects that Richard sees that an old woman and a young man examine their bingo cards. Hypothesis: Isabella suspects that an old woman and a young man examine their bingo cards.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Isabella suspects that Richard sees an old woman and a young man examining their bingo cards. The hypothesis states that Isabella suspects that an old woman and a young man examine their bingo cards. The hypothesis does not explicitly mention Richard seeing them, which is a crucial detail in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. 

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example:
The model wrongly evaluates the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. With an overemphasis on including all details from the premise in the hypothesis, the model concludes that because Richard is not mentioned in the hypothesis, it's a case of non-entailment. In reality, Richard's involvement is not absolutely essential to the crux of the statement - which is about Isabella's suspicion regarding the old woman and the young man examining their bingo cards. Its absence doesn't change the agreement between the hypothesis and the premise hence it's an entailment.

Reasons for Incorrect Evaluation:

1. Detailed Dependence: The current prompt heavily emphasizes including all details from the premise in the hypothesis to establish entailment. This can lead to an overestimation of the importance of certain details that, if absent, would not necessarily convert entailment into non-entailment. 

2. Limited Flexibility: The current prompt does not provide clear guidance on distinguishing between core and peripheral details. Not all details in the premise are always crucial for the hypothesis.

3. Context Neglect: The prompt asks for context consideration but does not specify how to treat or evaluate it. As in the prompt example, the context of Richard's involvement does not influence the main scenario which is Isabella's suspicion. 

Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:

1. Clear Definition: Explicitly mention in the prompt that not all details in the premise need to be reflected in the hypothesis to identify entailment.

2. Flexibility Emphasis: Introduce an emphasis on flexibility when evaluating hypotheses. The user should be informed that some details might be secondary and their absence does not necessarily make it a non-entailment.

3. Context Consideration: Provide clear guidance on how to evaluate and consider context and logical consistency. Specify that some context or details may not have an impact on the main premise and hypothesis relationship.

4. Explicit Evaluation: Encourage the model to explicitly evaluate whether the omitted details in the hypothesis change the core understanding of the premise. If they don't, it implies entailment.

Adjusting these aspects in the prompt can help the model more accurately determine entailment and non-entailment cases.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the prompt has failed to make clear the difference between what someone 'suspects' and what someone 'thinks'. Although the actions described in the premise and the hypothesis are identical, the source of the information is different. In the premise, James is just suspecting what Michael thinks, however, the hypothesis assumes that Michael is definitely thinking that. Suspecting something doesn't necessarily mean that it's actually happening. The language model hence failed to address this interpretation while analyzing the prompt.

Wrong Example 2:

Here, the prompt has not succeeded in distinguishing between Taylor's belief about Emma's thought and Taylor's own belief. The premise indicates that Taylor believes that Emma thinks something specific, while the hypothesis removes Emma from the equation and says that Taylor believes it directly. The model did not effectively consider this shift of source in the information and decided that the belief was consistent in both the premise and the hypothesis.

Reasons for wrong answers:

1) The instructions in the prompt don't specify that the language model should pay attention to the source of beliefs or thoughts. It treats 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' as equivalent, which is a mistake.
2) The prompt doesn't explicitly state that the language model must take into account the changes in belief attribution between the premise and the hypothesis.

Improvements for the prompt:

1) Add instructions to the prompt specifying that the source of beliefs and thoughts in the sentences is important and should be considered.
2) Specify that changes in attribution of beliefs and thoughts between the premise and the hypothesis should be considered as critical information for the final decision.
3) Highlight that the model should consider the certainty and uncertainty embedded in the words such as 'suspects' vs 'thinks'/ 'believes'.
4) Ensure the model thoroughly evaluates not just the actions, but also the contexts, the attributes, and the sources of the beliefs described in the premises and the hypotheses.

gradient:
After a thorough analysis of the input and output, I have identified the following reasons for the incorrect response from the language model:

1. Comprehension of Parameters: The instructions may be too detailed and complex for the language model to fully grasp all essential points. For instance, it might not correctly understand which part distinguishes entailment from non-entailment.

2. Centrality of Subject Position: The model might be assuming an entailment because the same subject "Michael" is used in both the premise and hypothesis. This may lead it to incorrectly conclude that the hypothesis logically follows the premise.

3. Basis on Assumptions: Both statements are founded on assumptions, which may have led the model to perceive them as logically connected or one being the consequence of the other.

4. Missing Distinctions: The AI might be failing to discern the subtle difference between a person assuming someone else’s thoughts and a person directly assuming something, therefore misunderstanding the contextual and logical bonds between the premise and the hypothesis.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. Simplify the Instructions: Break the instructions down into simpler steps that are easier to follow, ensuring that the AI understands each part fully.

2. More Concrete Examples: Provide more examples to illustrate the difference between entailment and non-entailment, particularly using similar sentences where the subject is central.

3. Hypothesis and Premise Differentiation: Clearly mention that the subject in the hypothesis and premise might not always be the same, and the AI should not reach a conclusion solely based on the subject being identical in the premise and the hypothesis. 

4. Embed Critical Thinking: Encourage the AI to approach entailment more critically, discerning deeper contextual meanings in the premise and hypothesis beyond their basic surface-level similarities.

5. Highlight Contextual Logic: The AI should thoroughly analyze the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. This includes considering context and the exact nature of the assumptions made.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: David assumes that Sophia assumes that there is a woman in a white tank top and camouflage pants with a big black belt on a stage holding a microphone. Hypothesis: Sophia assumes that there is a woman in a white tank top and camouflage pants with a big black belt on a stage holding a microphone.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that David assumes that Sophia assumes there is a woman in a specific outfit on a stage holding a microphone. The hypothesis simply states that Sophia assumes there is a woman in the same outfit on a stage holding a microphone. The hypothesis logically follows the premise because it directly relates to what Sophia is assumed to be thinking about. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise because the premise states that Ava believes that Olivia thinks a man is celebrating his victory, while the hypothesis states that Ava believes a man is celebrating his victory.

Premise: Abigail thinks that Joseph thinks that two belly dancers perform with each other in the streets while passersby look on and watch the display. Hypothesis: Joseph thinks that two belly dancers perform with each other in the streets while passersby look on and watch the display.
Options:
(A) entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail thinks that Joseph thinks that two belly dancers perform with each other in the streets while passersby look on and watch the display. The hypothesis states that Joseph thinks that two belly dancers perform with each other in the streets while passersby look on and watch the display. 

There is a clear attribution of thoughts in the premise, with Abigail thinking about what Joseph thinks. However, the hypothesis does not explicitly state that Joseph actually thinks about the belly dancers performing. It only mentions the action itself. Therefore, there is a lack of direct entailment between the premise and hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that John thinks that Abigail assumes that a group of girls in black and white spotted skirts cross a street. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that John thinks that a group of girls in black and white spotted skirts cross a street. There is a difference in attribution of beliefs between the premise and hypothesis - in the premise, John's belief is based on Abigail's assumption, while in the hypothesis, it is directly attributed to John himself. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
This example is incorrect because the model does not accurately differentiate between direct assertion and indirect belief. The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis because although David believes that Sophia assumes the situation, we don't directly know that Sophia actually assumes it. The prompt could be improved by instructing the model to distinguish between indirect reported speech and direct assertions and take into consideration the presence of 'assumptions' or 'belief' by secondary characters.

<2> 
Again, in this example, the model incorrectly assumes that the beliefs of one character are direct assertions of another. Just because Ava believes that Olivia thinks something, does not mean that Ava necessarily believes the same thing. The model should also consider the source of the beliefs or thoughts and evaluate whether a shift in the source of a belief by itself constitutes non-entailment.

<3> 
Here, there is a similar mistake. Just because Abigail believes that Joseph thinks something, this does not mean that Joseph actually thinks it. The model omits the nested structure of thoughts or beliefs in its assessment. The prompt could explicitly ask the model not to assume that if 'X believes that Y believes something', then 'Y necessarily believes that something'. 

<4>
This example further emphasizes the issue with source of belief attribution - just because John thinks that Abigail assumes something, does not entail John himself thinks the same thing. The model needs to be instructed clearly about the difference between direct belief attribution and indirect attribution.

In conclusion, the large number of errors are due to the model's apparent difficulty in handling the nested structure of beliefs, assumptions, and thoughts. To improve the prompt, the following changes are recommended:

1. Make it explicit to consider the source of the beliefs or thoughts and differentiate between direct and indirect assertions or beliefs.
2. Instruct the model to pay particular attention to the presence of 'assumptions' or 'belief' by secondary characters, and understand that indirect reported speech doesn't equal direct speech. 
3. When there are nested sentences, advise the model to analyze each belief individually and consider their attribution.
4. Lastly, assert the need to cautious about the shift in the source of a belief or thought, and to interpret such shifts as potential signs of 'non-entailment'.

Again, in this example, the model incorrectly assumes that the beliefs of one character are direct assertions of another. Just because Ava believes that Olivia thinks something, does not mean that Ava necessarily believes the same thing. The model should also consider the source of the beliefs or thoughts and evaluate whether a shift in the source of a belief by itself constitutes non-entailment.

<3> 
Here, there is a similar mistake. Just because Abigail believes that Joseph thinks something, this does not mean that Joseph actually thinks it. The model omits the nested structure of thoughts or beliefs in its assessment. The prompt could explicitly ask the model not to assume that if 'X believes that Y believes something', then 'Y necessarily believes that something'. 

<4>
This example further emphasizes the issue with source of belief attribution - just because John thinks that Abigail assumes something, does not entail John himself thinks the same thing. The model needs to be instructed clearly about the difference between direct belief attribution and indirect attribution.

In conclusion, the large number of errors are due to the model's apparent difficulty in handling the nested structure of beliefs, assumptions, and thoughts. To improve the prompt, the following changes are recommended:

1. Make it explicit to consider the source of the beliefs or thoughts and differentiate between direct and indirect assertions or beliefs.
2. Instruct the model to pay particular attention to the presence of 'assumptions' or 'belief' by secondary characters, and understand that indirect reported speech doesn't equal direct speech. 
3. When there are nested sentences, advise the model to analyze each belief individually and consider their attribution.
4. Lastly, assert the need to cautious about the shift in the source of a belief or thought, and to interpret such shifts as potential signs of 'non-entailment'.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind all aspects of the sentences. Consider the context, logical consistency, and the source of beliefs or thoughts. Pay particular attention to words that indicate certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Assess whether changes in attribution of beliefs and thoughts occur between the premise and hypothesis. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure your evaluation reflects not only the actions described in the hypothesis and premise, but also acknowledges the context, the attributes, and the manner of expressed beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts. Finally, bracket your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

<START> Analyze the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, keeping all sentence aspects in consideration. Examine the context, logical coherence, and the origin of beliefs or assumptions. Pay special attention to words that suggest certainty or uncertainty such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Specifically, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief or assumption about them. Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes that something'. Indicator words like 'thinks' and 'believes' used by secondary characters should not be taken as a direct assertion of belief. Nested sentences should be analyzed one by one, taking into consideration the attribution of each belief or assumption. With these detailed evaluations, assess if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and make a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should not only involve the described actions in the hypothesis and premise but also consider the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind all aspects of the sentences. Consider the context, logical consistency, and the source of beliefs or thoughts. Pay particular attention to words that indicate certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Sophia thinks that Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background. Hypothesis: Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Sophia thinks that Robert suspects that three people are hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background. The hypothesis states that Robert suspects that three people are hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background. 

There is a clear attribution of belief from Sophia to Robert in the premise, indicating that Robert's suspicion is based on Sophia's thoughts. However, the hypothesis does not mention Sophia at all, only focusing on Robert's suspicion. Therefore, there is a disconnect between the premise and hypothesis in terms of the attribution of beliefs.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William believes that Michael believes that a man, wearing a cap, is pushing a cart, on which large display boards are kept, on a road. Hypothesis: Michael believes that a man, wearing a cap, is pushing a cart, on which large display boards are kept, on a road.
Options:

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that William believes that Michael believes that a man, wearing a cap, is pushing a cart with large display boards on a road. The hypothesis states that Michael believes that a man, wearing a cap, is pushing a cart with large display boards on a road. 

Given that the premise specifically mentions that William believes that Michael believes something, it does not necessarily mean that Michael himself believes it. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

In the first example, the model's wrong conclusion could be mainly attributed to a misinterpretation due to the use of indirect speech in the premise - Sophia "thinks" that Robert "suspects." It seems that the model interpreted this as an absolute fact about Robert's suspicions, rather than a belief of Sophia's. The prompt did not give clear instructions on handling indirect speech and attributed beliefs, leading to this misunderstanding. 

Example 2:

The second error also stems from some misunderstanding of indirect speech and belief attribution. In this example, the premise involves a belief of a belief - William believing that Michael believes something. Here, the misinterpretation arises because the model assumes that because William believes something about Michael's belief, Michael must indeed hold that belief. The comprehension of indirect belief attributions is again an issue.

Improvements: 

1. Specify the Treatment of Indirect Speech and Attributed Beliefs: Include a clear guideline on how to handle indirect speech and particularly, belief attributions. Mention that a belief or thought attribution does not necessarily confirm the belief or thought of the attributed person.

2. Define the contextual relationship between premise and hypothesis: Explanation on how the premise and hypothesis need to match exactly - a belief about someone's belief doesn't confirm the second person’s belief. 

3. Adding explicit comparisons: The prompt can include explicit instructions about comparing all elements of the premise and hypothesis, with an emphasis on the agents or subjects involved in the action, and their thoughts and/or beliefs.

4. Consider Use of Non-definitive Words: The prompt can ask the model to take notice of words such as 'believes', 'thinks', and 'suspects' that show non-definitiveness. This would help with making logical interpretations based on these words.

5. Direct Clear Bracketing: Instead of asking the model to simply bracket the answer, explicit instructions of presenting the answer i.e., <answer>model's chosen option</answer> could enhance the task for the language model.

Determine if there's a shift in the attribution of thoughts or beliefs from the premise to hypothesis, and whether the hypothesis accurately and completely reflects the premise's attributions. If the premise includes attributed beliefs, remember that the belief or thought held by one person about another's thoughts or beliefs is not definitive proof that the second person holds that belief or thought. This must be specifically stated in the hypothesis to draw a direct line of entailment.

Judge if the hypothesis logically follows the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The result should not only mirror the activities described in the hypothesis and premise but also lay great emphasis on context, attributes, and how beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed.

Ensure all agents or subjects in the premise and hypothesis are matched carefully. If the premise and hypothesis include the same actions but do not share the same topic or subject, this should be factored into the choice between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

There is a difference in attribution of beliefs between the premise and hypothesis, as the premise talks about Charles's belief while the hypothesis talks about John's belief. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.

In this case, it did not identify that the belief went from Charles to John, resulting in a logical discrepancy.

Issue: The model failed to identify the shift in the attribution of beliefs from Charles to John.

Why it’s a problem: 
The prompt asks for a careful assessment of the attribution of beliefs or thoughts, and how it may vary between the premise and hypothesis. Failing to do so resulted in the wrong answer.

Possible Solution:
Increase emphasis on having the model understand that any change in belief attribution leads to 'non-entailment'.

Improvements to the prompt:

1) Add explicit instructions about considering changes in the source of the belief (from one person to another), and how it affects the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

2) The prompt could specify the importance of analyzing who the belief or thought is attributed to, and what it is about, as these are just as important as actions, if not more, in determining 'entailment' versus 'non-entailment'.

3) The mention of words indicating certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' could be complemented by highlighting the significance of the subject of these verbs (who believes or thinks what), to avoid any misunderstanding or negligence of these crucial sentences elements.

4) Instead of only mentioning changes in attribution, the prompt could instruct to evaluate any variation in person (subject), belief, and belief’s object between the premise and hypothesis.

5) To avoid any ambiguity, the prompt could include specific examples or scenarios illustrating how a change in belief attribution leads to 'non-entailment'. This could enhance the model's understanding and applicability of the instruction.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind all aspects of the sentences. Consider the context, logical consistency, and the source of beliefs or thoughts. Pay particular attention to words that indicate certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Assess whether changes in attribution of beliefs and thoughts occur between the premise and hypothesis. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure your evaluation reflects not only the actions described in the hypothesis and premise, but also acknowledges the context, the attributes, and the manner of expressed beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts. Finally, bracket your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John thinks that Charles believes that a young woman is standing on a slope, facing the top of the slope. Hypothesis: John thinks that a young woman is standing on a slope, facing the top of the slope.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that John thinks that Charles believes that a young woman is standing on a slope, facing the top of the slope. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly attributes the belief to John that a young woman is standing on a slope, facing the top of the slope. There is a difference in attribution of beliefs between the premise and hypothesis, as the premise talks about Charles's belief while the hypothesis talks about John's belief. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard sees that a young man in jeans and a red shirt, wearing yellow gloves, holds a tree branch. Hypothesis: Richard sees that a young man wears gloves.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
This is a case of non-entailment. The premise states that Richard sees a young man in jeans and a red shirt, wearing yellow gloves and holding a tree branch. However, the hypothesis only mentions that Richard sees a young man wearing gloves. The premise does not specify that the young man is wearing yellow gloves, so it is possible that the young man is wearing different gloves or no gloves at all. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: The prompt is asking if the following premise, “Richard sees that a young man in jeans and a red shirt, wearing yellow gloves, holds a tree branch”, logically infers the hypothesis “Richard sees that a young man wears gloves”.

Wrong Answer Explanation: The model incorrectly identified the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as a non-entailment. It believed that the yellow gloves in the premise didn't match the unspecified color of gloves in the hypothesis, interpreting it as a discrepancy. However, the hypothesis does not need to mention the color for it to logically follow from the premise, it simply states that the young man is wearing gloves, which is true as per the premise.

Prompt features that led to the wrong answer:

1. The prompt puts too much emphasis on the analysis of beliefs or assumptions, leading to the model unnecessarily scrutinizing each aspect of the sentences, including unimportant details such as color, which can sometimes lead to overthinking and false negatives.

2. The prompt doesn't highlight enough that an entailment doesn't require all premise details to be present in the hypothesis, only that the core information of the hypothesis is included in the premise. The lack of explicitness may lead to the model getting confused.

How can the prompt be improved:

1. Keep the concept of entailment clear by adding that the premise not only includes the same information as in the hypothesis but can also contain additional details.

2. Highlight the fact that small discrepancies in ancillary details or minor variances in narrative style should not affect the categorization into entailment or non-entailment.

3. Slightly reduce the emphasis on the analysis of beliefs and assumptions when there are no belief indicator words in the prompt.

4. Add an explicit statement to encourage the model not to overanalyze and remind the model to consider the broader structural and thematical context of the sentences. 

5. Include more specific examples in the prompt to set expectations for the model on the grading of entailment versus non-entailment.

6. Stress the importance of considering the core information or assertion made by the hypothesis and its relationship to the premise.

By taking these points into consideration, the prompt should be more effective in guiding the model to the correct answer for entailment and non-entailment tasks.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James recognizes that Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice. Hypothesis: Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
This is a case of non-entailment. The premise states that James recognizes that Charles believes something, but it does not directly state that Charles himself believes it. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically inferred from the premise. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: The proposed relationship is between a premise (James recognizes that Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice) and a hypothesis (Charles believes that two sweet young girls on ice skates, hands up and holding on to each other get ready to begin their performance on the ice.) The model identified this relationship as non-entailment when in fact it should have been identified as entailment.

Analysis:
1. The incorrect answer could be due to the model's instruction structure: the prompt said "Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes something'." However, in the specific question, we are told that James recognizes Charles' belief, so one can deduce that Charles indeed holds that belief. The prompt failed to distinguish between an assumption and an acknowledged belief, causing confusion for the language model.
2. The model had to evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief. However, the prompt's phrasing does not sufficiently clarify that a recognized belief is a direct attribution.

Improvement Aspects:
1. The differentiation between recognized belief and assumed belief mentioned in the prompt needs clarification. The language model would benefit from clear instructions specifying the conditions where it recognises beliefs directly attributed to one character versus those indirectly indicated by another character.
2. The prompt must be explicit in stating that the phrase 'X believes that Y believes something' could imply 'Y believes something' if it is clear that X recognizes Y's belief, and not merely assumes so. Thus, the correct interpretation depends heavily on the presented context and circumstances. 
3. The instructions can incorporate a part regarding the different signals like 'recognizes', 'assumes', 'thinks' etc., which can be indicators of an entailment situation.
4. The language model's evaluation process could be enhanced by adding instructive statements about recognizing recognized, assumed, implied beliefs, and how they can be considered to determine entailment or non-entailment. This can help avoid the misjudgement seen in this example.
5. The prompt can also include specific instructions about dealing with cases where multiple belief attributions are present, as seen in this question.
6. Nested sentences and their analysis guidance can be made more elaborate to help in correct prediction.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind all aspects of the sentences. Consider the context, logical consistency, and the source of beliefs or thoughts. Pay particular attention to words that indicate certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Assess whether changes in attribution of beliefs and thoughts occur between the premise and hypothesis. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure your evaluation reflects not only the actions described in the hypothesis and premise, but also acknowledges the context, the attributes, and the manner of expressed beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts. Finally, bracket your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(3) Analyze the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, keeping all sentence aspects in consideration. Examine the context, logical coherence, and the origin of beliefs or assumptions. Pay special attention to words that suggest certainty or uncertainty such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Specifically, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief or assumption about them. Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes that something'. Indicator words like 'thinks' and 'believes' used by secondary characters should not be taken as a direct assertion of belief. Nested sentences should be analyzed one by one, taking into consideration the attribution of each belief or assumption. With these detailed evaluations, assess if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and make a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should not only involve the described actions in the hypothesis and premise but also consider the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed. Finally, enclose your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end of your response.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Conduct a detailed analysis of the given premise and hypothesis, scrutinizing each aspect of the sentences provided. Delve into the context and logical coherence while trying to understand the source of beliefs or assumptions. Pay careful attention to words that indicate a degree of certainty or uncertainty, like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Examine if there's a shift in marking the source of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. In particular, establish whether the belief is directly assigned to a character or subtly signified through another character's belief or presumption about them. Be aware that someone asserting 'X believes that Y believes something' doesn't always mean 'Y actually believes that something'. 'Thinks' or 'believes' used by secondary characters aren't always a direct assertion of belief. However, note that the assertion 'X recognizes that Y believes something' does imply 'Y believes something', since recognition signifies a more concrete form of belief attribution. Consequently, the context is crucial in deciphering the correct interpretation. Examine each nested sentence individually, considering the source of each belief or assumption. Following a thorough investigation, evaluate if the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, then choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Again, the examination should not only engage with the actions detailed in both the hypothesis and premise but also contemplate the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are conveyed. Finally, enclose your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the conclusion of your response. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that John assumes that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. Hypothesis: James thinks that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James thinks that John assumes that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly attributes the belief to James that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. There is a shift in the attribution of beliefs from John in the premise to James in the hypothesis. However, since the belief is directly attributed to James in both the premise and the hypothesis, there is entailment between the two statements.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:

For the given example, despite the premise and hypothesis being similar in events, there's a shift from James's perception of John's assumption to James's own belief, which results in the option of 'non-entailment'.

Issue 1: Focus on 'Believes'
The prompt instructs the model to pay special attention to statements of belief with words like 'thinks' or 'believes', but doesn't focus enough on the differentiations within these beliefs, like nested assumptions or assumptions by other characters.

Issue 2: Implication of Nested Characters' Belief
The prompt could better explain the nuances of belief attributions when nested in the sentence structure. In this case, James thinking that John assumes something does not automatically mean that James himself believes that thing. 

Issue 3: Logical transition of beliefs and assumptions
The prompt asks the model to determine if there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs from the premise to the hypothesis but doesn't explicitly instruct to consider if this shift leads to 'non-entailment'. The shift might be misleading to the model as it could interpret it as a continuation or validation of the belief rather than a difference.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. More emphasis on differentiated beliefs: The prompt should place more emphasis on differentiating the beliefs and assumptions of characters, making it explicit that beliefs or assumptions by one character does not necessarily mean that those beliefs or assumptions are shared by another character. 

2. Clearer guidance on nested beliefs: The prompt should provide clearer guidelines on how nested beliefs or assumptions should be interpreted. A clear differentiation of implication versus explicit assertion needs to be made.

3. Explicit mention of attribution shift: The prompt should explicitly mention that a shift in the attribution of beliefs or thoughts may lead to 'non-entailment', indicating a difference in beliefs among the characters involved. 

4. Improved guidelines on entailment and non-entailment determination: The prompt needs clearer instructions for determining whether a hypothesis logically follows the premise, specifying that the distinction in beliefs or assumptions identified in the premise and hypothesis can lead to 'non-entailment'. 

5. More illustrative real-world examples: The prompt could benefit from providing more diverse examples encompassing different scenarios that could come up while addressing belief and assumption attributions.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, keeping all sentence aspects in consideration. Examine the context, logical coherence, and the origin of beliefs or assumptions. Pay special attention to words that suggest certainty or uncertainty such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Specifically, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief or assumption about them. Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes that something'. Indicator words like 'thinks' and 'believes' used by secondary characters should not be taken as a direct assertion of belief. Nested sentences should be analyzed one by one, taking into consideration the attribution of each belief or assumption. With these detailed evaluations, assess if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and make a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should not only involve the described actions in the hypothesis and premise but also consider the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed. Finally, enclose your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end of your response.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that John assumes that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. Hypothesis: James thinks that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James thinks that John assumes that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly attributes the belief to James that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. There is a shift in the attribution of beliefs from John in the premise to James in the hypothesis. However, since the belief is directly attributed to James in both the premise and the hypothesis, there is entailment between the two statements.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind all aspects of the sentences. Consider the context, logical consistency, and the source of beliefs or thoughts. Pay particular attention to words that indicate certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Assess whether changes in attribution of beliefs and thoughts occur between the premise and hypothesis. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure your evaluation reflects not only the actions described in the hypothesis and premise, but also acknowledges the context, the attributes, and the manner of expressed beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts. Finally, bracket your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(3) Analyze the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, keeping all sentence aspects in consideration. Examine the context, logical coherence, and the origin of beliefs or assumptions.

Determine whether there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Specifically, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief or assumption about them. Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes that something'. Indicator words like 'thinks' and 'believes' used by secondary characters should not be taken as a direct assertion of belief. Nested sentences should be analyzed one by one, taking into consideration the attribution of each belief or assumption.

Your evaluation should not only involve the described actions in the hypothesis and premise but also consider the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed. Finally, enclose your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end of your response.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START>
Carry out a detailed analysis of the given premise and hypothesis, focusing on every aspect of the sentences. Examine the overall context, consistency in logic, and the sources of beliefs or assumptions. Pay close attention to words that convey certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Identify whether there is a change in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Importantly, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributable to a character or indirectly inferred through another character's belief or assumption about them. A crucial clarification here is that 'X believes that Y believes something' does not automatically imply 'Y believes that something'. Moreover, terms such as 'thinks' and 'believes' employed by secondary characters should not be interpreted as a direct declaration of belief by the primary characters. An analysis of nested sentences should be conducted one by one, focusing on the attribution of each belief or assumption, particularly tackling the complexities of nested assumptions. A shift in the attribution of beliefs from one character to another implies a difference rather than a continuation of belief. Based on this thorough examination, evaluate whether the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, culminating in a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should comprise not only the actions detailed in the hypothesis and premise but also the given context, the attributes of each belief, and how beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed. Lastly, mark your chosen response using the tags <answer> and </answer> following your response.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. Hypothesis: William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. The subject of belief in the premise is William, and the belief is about the direction in which the runners are running.

The hypothesis states that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. The subject of belief in the hypothesis is also William, and the belief is the same as in the premise.

There is no change in the subject, belief, or object of belief between the premise and hypothesis. Both the premise and hypothesis attribute the belief about the direction of the runners to William.

Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and there is entailment between the two.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella assumes that Michael sees that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background. Hypothesis: Isabella assumes that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background.
Options:
(A) entailment

The hypothesis states that Isabella assumes that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background.

There is a shift in the subject of the belief from Michael in the premise to a general assumption in the hypothesis. The belief in the premise is about what Michael sees, while the belief in the hypothesis is a general assumption made by Isabella. This shift in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. The subject of the belief is William, and the belief is about Michael knowing about the woman in an apron looking for bread. 

The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. The subject of the belief remains William, but the belief is now about the woman in an apron looking for bread.

There is a clear shift in the object of the belief from Michael knowing to the woman in an apron looking for bread between the premise and hypothesis. This shift in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire my a building. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire my a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. 

There is a shift in the subject of the belief from Amelia in the premise to Joseph in the hypothesis. This change in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment as the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. Hypothesis: William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
In this case, the model failed to distinguish between assumptions and stated beliefs. Emma's assumption about William's belief is not the same as stating that William directly holds that belief. Thus, the correct answer should be non-entailment as the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.

<2> 
Question: Isabella assumes that Michael sees that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background. Hypothesis: Isabella assumes that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
The model mistakenly perceived that there was a change in the subject of belief from Michael to a general assumption, which is incorrect. The belief is about Michael seeing the scene. The statement in the hypothesis is still a belief attributed to Isabella, but it's about the scene itself - a subset of the original belief - thus we have entailment.

<3> 
Question: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
While the model correctly identified that there is a shift in the object of the belief, it falsely ruled this as non-entailment. If William thinks Michael knows something, it is fair to infer that William also knows that thing.

<4> 
Question: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire by a building.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
The wrong answer was chosen due to a misunderstanding of the equivalent belief attribution. Joseph's assumption is the same in both the premise and the hypothesis; Amelia's understanding doesn't falsify Joseph's general assumption.

Aspects to improve the prompt:

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Evaluate carefully the given premise and hypothesis, placing strong emphasis on understanding the source and attribution of beliefs or thoughts. Observe the subjects of beliefs or thoughts—i.e., who holds these beliefs or thoughts, and what they are about. Pay special attention to words like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' and the subjects associated with these verbs. Assess if there is any change in the subject, the belief, and the object of these beliefs between the premise and hypothesis. Any shift in the source of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another often leads to 'non-entailment'. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise after considering the context, logical consistency, and the entities' actions and thoughts. Ensure that your evaluation not only reflects the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, but also thoroughly considers the context, attributes, and changes in belief attribution. Finally, based on your comprehensive evaluation, choose between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', bracketing your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. Hypothesis: William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. The subject of belief in the premise is William, and the belief is about the direction in which the runners are running.

The hypothesis states that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. The subject of belief in the hypothesis is also William, and the belief is the same as in the premise.

There is no change in the subject, belief, or object of belief between the premise and hypothesis. Both the premise and hypothesis attribute the belief about the direction of the runners to William.

Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and there is entailment between the two.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella assumes that Michael sees that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background. Hypothesis: Isabella assumes that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Isabella assumes that Michael sees a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background. The hypothesis states that Isabella assumes that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background.

There is a shift in the subject of the belief from Michael in the premise to a general assumption in the hypothesis. The belief in the premise is about what Michael sees, while the belief in the hypothesis is a general assumption made by Isabella. This shift in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. The subject of the belief is William, and the belief is about Michael knowing about the woman in an apron looking for bread. 

The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. The subject of the belief remains William, but the belief is now about the woman in an apron looking for bread.

There is a clear shift in the object of the belief from Michael knowing to the woman in an apron looking for bread between the premise and hypothesis. This shift in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire my a building. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire my a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. 

There is a shift in the subject of the belief from Amelia in the premise to Joseph in the hypothesis. This change in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment as the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. Hypothesis: William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
In this case, the model failed to distinguish between assumptions and stated beliefs. Emma's assumption about William's belief is not the same as stating that William directly holds that belief. Thus, the correct answer should be non-entailment as the hypothesis does not follow directly from the premise.

<2> 
Question: Isabella assumes that Michael sees that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background. Hypothesis: Isabella assumes that a young man wearing khaki pants and a checked shirt is jumping over large rocks with green mountains and a lagoon in the background.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
The model mistakenly perceived that there was a change in the subject of belief from Michael to a general assumption, which is incorrect. The belief is about Michael seeing the scene. The statement in the hypothesis is still a belief attributed to Isabella, but it's about the scene itself - a subset of the original belief - thus we have entailment.

<3> 
Question: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
While the model correctly identified that there is a shift in the object of the belief, it falsely ruled this as non-entailment. If William thinks Michael knows something, it is fair to infer that William also knows that thing.

<4> 
Question: Joseph assumes that Amelia understands that three military officials are battling a fire by a building. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that three military officials are battling a fire by a building.

Wrong Answer Analysis:
The wrong answer was chosen due to a misunderstanding of the equivalent belief attribution. Joseph's assumption is the same in both the premise and the hypothesis; Amelia's understanding doesn't falsify Joseph's general assumption.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Include clarification for nested beliefs or assumptions. Ensure the model understands the differentiation and relationship between belief and assumption.
2. Provide clearer instructions on how to treat an individual's belief about another's knowledge.
3. Offer a guideline on dealing with subsets of original beliefs in the hypothesis.
4. Reinforce that a shift in the belief's subject doesn't always make the hypothesis a non-entailment.
5. Ensure the model is analytical about the source of the belief, whether it remains constant, and how it affects the entailment.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind all aspects of the sentences. Consider the context, logical consistency, and the source of beliefs or thoughts. Pay particular attention to words that indicate certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Assess whether changes in attribution of beliefs and thoughts occur between the premise and hypothesis. Based on this comprehensive evaluation, determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure your evaluation reflects not only the actions described in the hypothesis and premise, but also acknowledges the context, the attributes, and the manner of expressed beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts. Finally, bracket your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(3) Evaluate carefully the given premise and hypothesis, placing strong emphasis on understanding the source and attribution of beliefs or thoughts. Observe the subjects of beliefs or thoughts—i.e., who holds these beliefs or thoughts, and what they are about. Pay special attention to words like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' and the subjects associated with these verbs. Assess if there is any change in the subject, the belief, and the object of these beliefs between the premise and hypothesis. Any shift in the source of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another often leads to 'non-entailment'. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise after considering the context, logical consistency, and the entities' actions and thoughts. Ensure that your evaluation not only reflects the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, but also thoroughly considers the context, attributes, and changes in belief attribution. Finally, based on your comprehensive evaluation, choose between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', bracketing your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Evelyn suspects that a balding, heavyset man and a dog are resting beside an ornate monument featuring a greenish statue of a man and a woman. Hypothesis: Evelyn suspects that there are both people and animals in this picture.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Evelyn suspects that a balding, heavyset man and a dog are resting beside an ornate monument featuring a greenish statue of a man and a woman. The subject of the belief is Evelyn, and the belief is about the presence of specific individuals and a dog in a particular location.

The hypothesis states that Evelyn suspects that there are both people and animals in this picture. The subject of the belief remains Evelyn, but the belief has shifted to a more general statement about the presence of people and animals in a picture.

There is a change in the belief attribution from specific individuals and a dog to a more general statement about people and animals. This change in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment between the premise and hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <non-entailment>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella thinks that a little girl has her arms around a little boy standing on a wooden bridge in the woods. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that the children hug in the woods.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Isabella thinks that a little girl has her arms around a little boy standing on a wooden bridge in the woods. The hypothesis states that Isabella thinks that the children hug in the woods. 

In the premise, the subject of the belief is Isabella and the belief is about the children standing on a wooden bridge. In the hypothesis, the subject of the belief is still Isabella, but the belief is now about the children hugging in the woods. There is a shift in the object of the belief from the children standing on a bridge to the children hugging in the woods.

Based on the evaluation of the premise and hypothesis, there is a non-entailment between them. The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as there is a change in the belief attribution from the children standing on a bridge to the children hugging in the woods.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> The model determined the answer to be ‘non-entailment’ as it perceived a shift in belief attribution. It interpreted the premise and the hypothesis as having different degrees of specificity, viewing the hypothesis as a more general statement. However, the two sentences should be seen as logically consistent. The hypothesis is indeed a more general claim but it still respects the information from the premise; it does not contradict it. Evelyn's belief about the presence of both people (balding, heavyset man) and animals (dog) in the picture is logically consistent with the hypothesis that she suspects there are both people and animals in the picture.

<2> In this scenario, the model wrongly identified the shift in Isabella's belief about the children's actions as a non-entailment. While there is indeed a shift in the specific actions of the children (from standing on a bridge to hugging), the latter still logically follows the former. The act of having her arms around a little boy can be legitimately perceived as a hug, making the hypothesis a logical follow-up of the premise. 

Prompt Improvement:

1. The prompt should clarify that the model should consider the general and specific aspects of the belief, not as indications for 'non-entailment', but for the logical consistency between them.

2. It should emphasize on evaluating the compatibility between the premise and the hypothesis, whether the hypothesis can uphold under the constraints set by the premise, rather than focusing on absolute similarities.

3. The model needs to understand and consider the semantic relationships between different descriptions. For example, hugging can be a precise form of "having the arms around" someone. It might guarantee more precise reasoning if the model was instructed to evaluate the semantic relationship between actions, objects or states of being described in the premise and the hypothesis.

4. Inconsistent degrees of specificity between the premise and hypothesis do not automatically indicate 'non-entailment'. The model needs to see if generalized statements in the hypothesis are still logically consistent with the details provided in the premise.

5. Ensure that the model comprehends that entailment also considers logically equivalent simplifications or generalizations from premise to hypothesis. Adding this information could possibly increase its predictive power.

6. Elicit that 'non-entailment' does not mean simply a change or shift in thought, belief or object from the premise to the hypothesis, but rather when the hypothesis presents or assumes information that the premise does not affirm or allow.

By addressing these points, the prompt will direct the model's understanding and analysis in a more comprehensive and accurate direction.

There is a change in the belief attribution from specific individuals and a dog to a more general statement about people and animals. This change in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment between the premise and hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <non-entailment>. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The model's input is:
Evaluate carefully the given premise and hypothesis, placing strong emphasis on understanding the source and attribution of beliefs or thoughts. Observe the subjects of beliefs or thoughts—i.e., who holds these beliefs or thoughts, and what they are about. Pay special attention to words like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' and the subjects associated with these verbs. Assess if there is any change in the subject, the belief, and the object of these beliefs between the premise and hypothesis. Any shift in the source of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another often leads to 'non-entailment'. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise after considering the context, logical consistency, and the entities' actions and thoughts. Ensure that your evaluation not only reflects the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, but also thoroughly considers the context, attributes, and changes in belief attribution.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella thinks that a little girl has her arms around a little boy standing on a wooden bridge in the woods. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that the children hug in the woods.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Isabella thinks that a little girl has her arms around a little boy standing on a wooden bridge in the woods. The hypothesis states that Isabella thinks that the children hug in the woods. 

In the premise, the subject of the belief is Isabella and the belief is about the children standing on a wooden bridge. In the hypothesis, the subject of the belief is still Isabella, but the belief is now about the children hugging in the woods. There is a shift in the object of the belief from the children standing on a bridge to the children hugging in the woods.

Based on the evaluation of the premise and hypothesis, there is a non-entailment between them. The hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as there is a change in the belief attribution from the children standing on a bridge to the children hugging in the woods.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> The model determined the answer to be ‘non-entailment’ as it perceived a shift in belief attribution. It interpreted the premise and the hypothesis as having different degrees of specificity, viewing the hypothesis as a more general statement. However, the two sentences should be seen as logically consistent. The hypothesis is indeed a more general claim but it still respects the information from the premise; it does not contradict it. Evelyn's belief about the presence of both people (balding, heavyset man) and animals (dog) in the picture is logically consistent with the hypothesis that she suspects there are both people and animals in the picture.

<2> In this scenario, the model wrongly identified the shift in Isabella's belief about the children's actions as a non-entailment. While there is indeed a shift in the specific actions of the children (from standing on a bridge to hugging), the latter still logically follows the former. The act of having her arms around a little boy can be legitimately perceived as a hug, making the hypothesis a logical follow-up of the premise. 

Prompt Improvement:

1. The prompt should clarify that the model should consider the general and specific aspects of the belief, not as indications for 'non-entailment', but for the logical consistency between them.

2. It should emphasize on evaluating the compatibility between the premise and the hypothesis, whether the hypothesis can uphold under the constraints set by the premise, rather than focusing on absolute similarities.

3. The model needs to understand and consider the semantic relationships between different descriptions. For example, hugging can be a precise form of "having the arms around" someone. It might guarantee more precise reasoning if the model was instructed to evaluate the semantic relationship between actions, objects or states of being described in the premise and the hypothesis.

4. Inconsistent degrees of specificity between the premise and hypothesis do not automatically indicate 'non-entailment'. The model needs to see if generalized statements in the hypothesis are still logically consistent with the details provided in the premise.

5. Ensure that the model comprehends that entailment also considers logically equivalent simplifications or generalizations from premise to hypothesis. Adding this information could possibly increase its predictive power.

6. Elicit that 'non-entailment' does not mean simply a change or shift in thought, belief or object from the premise to the hypothesis, but rather when the hypothesis presents or assumes information that the premise does not affirm or allow.

By addressing these points, the prompt will direct the model's understanding and analysis in a more comprehensive and accurate direction.

response:
<START> 

Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, focusing primarily on understanding the origin, attribution, and evolution of thoughts or beliefs. Analyze the subjects of these thoughts or beliefs, i.e., who holds these thoughts or beliefs and their content. Note words such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks', and identify the subjects associated with these verbs. Determine if there is any change in the subject, the thought, and the object of these thoughts between the premise and hypothesis. Keep in mind that a shift in the origin of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another may lead to 'non-entailment', but doesn't imply so in all cases. 

Evaluate if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, considering both specific and generalized aspects, context, logical consistency, semantic relationships, and actions or thoughts. Remember, the hypothesis need not duplicate the premise exactly. It can also be a simplified, generalized, or semantically equivalent form that adheres to the premise's constraints. 

Check if the degree of specificity in hypothesis is compatible with the premise. Generalized statement in the hypothesis is accepted as entailment if it respects the premise's details. 

'Non-entailment' is not just about shifts in thought or beliefs; it should be selected when the hypothesis presents or assumes information not affirmed or allowed by the premise. 

Make sure your evaluation takes into account the context, attributes, the degree of specificity, semantic relationships, and changes in belief attribution, alongside the actions and beliefs portrayed in both the hypothesis and premise. Finally, based on your detailed evaluation, make a choice between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', enclosing your selection in <answer> and </answer> tags at the end.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that three teenagers wearing t-shirt run down the beach, with several other people in the background. Hypothesis: Robert remembers that a number of young people run on a beach.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Robert remembers three teenagers wearing t-shirts running down the beach, with several other people in the background. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Robert remembers a number of young people running on a beach. 

There is a shift in the subject of the belief from specifically three teenagers to a more general group of young people. This change in the source of the belief leads to non-entailment between the premise and hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The instruction in the prompt states: "Assess if there is any change in the subject, the belief, and the object of these beliefs between the premise and hypothesis. Any shift in the source of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another often leads to 'non-entailment'." This might have led the model to pick 'non-entailment' as there is a change in the details of the subject from 'three teenagers' to 'a number of young people'. 

The instructions in the prompt were likely too complex and detailed, leading the model to overanalyze the directions. The references to considering shifts in subjects, beliefs, and objects may have caused the model to place too much importance on these features, thus prompting the wrong answer.

Additionally, the model might have interpreted the instruction to: "Pay special attention to words like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' and the subjects associated with these verbs" to mean that it has to strictly interpret the entities and actions without considering the overall meaning conveyed in both the premise and inference. 

Improvements that can be made to the prompt include:

1. The prompt should be simplified to ensure clarity and to avoid overemphasizing unnecessarily detailed analysis.

2. The prompt should clearly state that the model shouldn't overfocus on less important details at the expense of the overall themes between the premise and the hypothesis.

3. Rather than focusing on changes in 'who' holds the belief or what the belief is about, the model should be trained to understand that minor changes in subjects or object details do not necessarily lead to non-entailment especially if the overall idea or theme remains similar. 

4. The prompt needs to emphasize the fluid interpretation of context when judging between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

5. The prompt should clarify the difference between minor alterations and significant changes that can affect whether a conclusion logically follows from a premise.

Your evaluation should reflect the substance of the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, considering the attributes and any significant changes in belief attribution. Finally, based on your comprehensive evaluation, select between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', indicating your chosen answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Incorrect Example: 
Premise: Charles assumes that a white and black spotted dog is running through a grassy area. Hypothesis: Taylor assumes that a dog is outdoors.

Misinterpretation: The model erroneously predicted an entailment because it observed a contextual overlap between the premise and the hypothesis i.e., both involve a dog in an outdoor setting. However, it failed to notice the crucial difference in persons making the assumption which results in non-entailment. 

<2> 
Incorrect Example: 
Premise: Isabella thinks that Amelia understands that men play hockey. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that men play hockey.

Misinterpretation: The Language model failed to grasp the subtle context here. Both the premise and the hypothesis involve the same character, Isabella. However, it doesn’t rightly interpret the conveyance of knowledge depicted in the premise (Isabella believes Amelia knows a fact) which means it also implies that Isabella herself understands the fact (i.e., men play hockey). The model incorrectly labelled this as non-entailment instead of entailment. 

<3> 
Incorrect Example: 
Premise: Charles believes that two teams of men are playing basketball on a court in an empty stadium. Hypothesis: Ava believes that the men are playing basketball with no audience.

Misinterpretation: The model made the mistake by taking the content (two teams of men playing basketball on a court in an empty stadium) of the belief as the entailment, ignoring the fact that different characters (Charles and Ava) believed the statements. This variation in the subjects who hold the belief ultimately leads to non-entailment.

<4> 
Incorrect Example: 
Premise: Robert suspects that Charlotte assumes that three people are dressed in costumes and playing musical instruments. Hypothesis: Charlotte assumes that three people are dressed in costumes and playing musical instruments.

Misinterpretation: The language model disregarded the different levels of speculation (Robert SUSPECTING what Charlotte ASSUMES). Instead, the model focused on the thematic similarity (three people are dressed in costumes and playing musical instruments), leading it to incorrectly label this as entailment, when it in fact is non-entailment. 

Recommendations to improve the prompt:

1. Highlight the importance of the subject who holds the premise or belief, rather than only focusing on the content of the belief.
2. Clarification on different levels of knowledge or cognizance, such as thinking, assuming, suspecting, etc.
3. Underscore the relevance of understanding and considering the interplay of all elements of the premises and hypotheses beyond their thematic overlap.
4. Emphasize to the model that a change in the belief holder can influence the outcome. 
5. Succinctly clarify how the direction, propagation, or transference of knowledge within the sentence may imply entailment. 
6. Guide the model to discern the subtle and implicit inferences that can be drawn based on the context of the sentences.

(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Your task is to analyze the premise and hypothesis given to you. Carefully consider every detail provided in the sentences. Your objective is to confirm if the hypothesis is a logical outcome of the premise by choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Be sure to consider all possible inferences from the premise.

<START> Your mission is to dissect the provided premise and hypothesis. Give careful thought to every detail contained in the sentences. Your goal is to validate whether the hypothesis logically emanates from the premise, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make efforts to thoroughly consider all potential inferences that can be gathered from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise carries significance and must be logically contrasted or compared with the hypothesis. Do not assume entailment merely based on the identity of the subject in both the premise and hypothesis. Moreover, be aware that the premise’s assumption may not always pertain directly to the hypothesis. It is crucial to note that the subject – the character holding a belief or assumption – plays a significant role in the inference. Understand the essence of the context and ensure there is logical coherence in your final decision. Be conscious of different levels of knowledge or belief such as assuming, thinking, suspecting, etc. Your conclusion must be an outcome of a comprehensive scrutiny of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, considering the context, implicit inferences, knowledge propagation direction within the premises, and cognitive levels. In cases where beliefs are involved, acknowledge that a change in the belief holder can alter the outcome. Your written response must be enclosed within <answer> and </answer>. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma knows that Isabella thinks that the man in the blue shirt is relaxing on the rocks. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that Emma knows that the man in the blue shirt is relaxing on the rocks.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1>
In this example, the language model's prompt seems to be failing in accounting for the conceptual separation between 'Abigail's suspicion' and 'Amelia's action'. The language model seems to be equating Abigail's suspicion about Amelia's action as a confirmation of the said action. Instead, it needs to understand that a suspicion doesn't directly translate to a truth or an established fact. It seems the existing prompt doesn't sufficiently emphasize the need to differentiate between these subtle aspects like suspicion and confirmed truth when evaluating the premise and hypothesis.

<2>
In this situation, although the premise and the hypothesis contain similar entities and situations, the relationship between Emma and Isabella is reversed in the hypothesis. The model appears to incorrectly identify this as entailment, instead of non-entailment. The issue could be due to the language model not adequately considering the specific roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences and taking into account the logical consistency of these relations from premise to hypothesis. 

Based on these observations, the following improvements can be made in order to make the prompt clearer and more effective:

1. Incorporate emphasis on evaluating the nature of statements in the premise (such as suspicions, beliefs, established facts, etc.) and their implications when comparing with the hypothesis.

2. Stress the importance of considering the specific roles, positions, or directions of the relations in the sentences. A reversal or change in the positioning of the subjects and their relations could alter the entailment.

3. Highlight that the identical statements or subjects in the premise and hypothesis don't necessarily imply entailment and even subtle changes can lead to non-entailment.

4. Greater emphasis on the evaluation of each entity's role in both the premise and hypothesis and whether this matches or not. For instance, if 'Emma knows' something in the premise, ensure it is 'Emma knows' in the hypothesis as well for entailment to exist. 

5. Encourage a closer inspection of the logical and sequential consistency between the premise and the hypothesis. The chronological order and the flow of events or facts also play a pivotal role in determining entailment. 

6. Last but not least, remind the language model to place herself in different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief' when comparing the premise and the hypothesis. This could lead to a better understanding of how information is conveyed and whether the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1 Analysis:
The major issue with the first example is that the model seems to misunderstand the relationship between Robert and Olivia in the premise and the hypothesis. It ignores that the structure of the sentences has been inverted in the hypothesis and considers the two situations as identical, leading to a wrong entailment prediction. Although the sentence content is the same, who perceives the information first (Robert or Olivia) significantly changes the context.

Wrong Example 2 Analysis:
Like in the first example, the model ignores the structure and context of the sentences and argues for entailment based solely on the identicality of facts described. It fails to recognize that just because William believes something about David's beliefs, it doesn't necessarily mean that David truly believes it. The model is misunderstanding the scenario where a person is guessing or assuming other people's beliefs, which are not definitive or equivalent to the direct beliefs of the person.

Potential Improvement Aspects:
1. It would be beneficial for the model to understand that entailment does not only depend on the content of a sentence but also on the subject. Specifically, the model needs to understand that each individual's perception or belief about a scenario could differ, and entailment cannot be assumed based solely on identical sentence content. 

2. The model should take more into account that the subject's perspective and their knowledge or beliefs about the situation are important. For instance, understanding that beliefs or thoughts can be subjective and not necessarily true or shared by others. 

3. Remind the model that the order and structure of information in sentences can also impact the premise and hypothesis relationship. Similarly, person A recognizing person B's thought is different from person B recognizing person A's thought.

4. The task related to understanding beliefs should be explained more clearly so the model knows it should not automatically assume 'entailment' simply because the subjects or actions within the premise and hypothesis are similar.

5. The model needs a better understanding that an individual's thoughts or recognitions about other people's thoughts or beliefs are not always accurate or definitive. 

In summary, the initial instructions make it sound like identicality of subjects or content might often result in entailment. Instead, instructions need to better emphasize the necessity of logical coherence according to the context and not to simplify the assumptions of entailment based on equivalency of subjects or events.

Your objective is to ascertain whether the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to take into account all potential inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise carries importance and must be logically linked or delinked with the hypothesis based on its relevance. Avoid assuming identical or similar subjects between the premise and hypothesis as an automatic entailment. Also, understand that an assumption present in the premise may not necessarily be applicable in the hypothesis. Consider the order of sentence elements and the perspective or belief of individual subjects as these can drastically affect the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. It's important to comprehend the context and ensure that your conclusion exhibits logical consistency. Keep in mind that contradiction or variations in a person's beliefs or thoughts about others aren't always in line with reality or directly inferable. Your final response, a result of a comprehensive analysis of the premise-hypothesis relationship, must be highlighted between <answer> and </answer>.

cur_prompt: Your task is to meticulously analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Ensure you contemplate all potential inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise holds value and must be logically weighed against the hypothesis. Be cautious that an identical subject in the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The assumptions in the premise may not always have a direct correspondence with the hypothesis. Always consider the exact roles entities play in both sentences and check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor thinks that Isabella suspects that three young Asian women walk on a rain soaked street with traffic in the background. Hypothesis: Isabella suspects that three young Asian women walk on a rain soaked street with traffic in the background.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the language model chose 'entailment' as its answer, when the correct answer was 'non-entailment'. This suggests that the model was not able to fully interpret the difference between 'Taylor thinks that Isabella suspects' and 'Isabella suspects'. While in normal conversation these may be taken as more or less equivalent, they do not necessarily mean the same thing. 

This could be due to several aspects of the prompt:

1. The prompt encourages in-depth analysis of the premise and hypothesis, but does not highlight the importance of assigning different weights to different information. In this case, the source of the suspicion is critically different in the premise and the hypothesis.

2. The language model may have been misled by its instruction to consider the 'nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs)' and the mention of adopting different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief'. This could potentially have caused the model to overvalue the 'suspicion' and undervalue the source of the suspicion ('Taylor thinks that Isabella suspects' vs 'Isabella suspects').

3. The prompt focuses heavily on logical and sequential consistency of events or facts in the premise and hypothesis, but the main difference in this case does not lie in the events or facts, but in the source of the suspicion. 

4. The role of entities and their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis is another key aspect which is mentioned. However, it might be not specific enough to cover the source of information or belief.

5. Furthermore, the prompt does not emphasize the need to consider who or what is the subject of the sentences in the premise and hypothesis, when this is often a critically important piece of information. 

Improvement for the prompt:

1. Clearly state the importance of considering the source or origin of information or belief in statements. While absorbing every detail in the sentences given, the users are instructed to note who or what is the subject of any actions or beliefs.

2. In addition to analyzing the nature of the statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs), instruct the model to pay special attention to who or what is expressing or experiencing these suspicions or beliefs.

3. Instruct the model to be wary of assuming entailment when the subjects of the premise and hypothesis are similar, but not identical, like in this case.

4. Define what exactly are the roles or positions of different entities in the sentences and elaborate more on how to check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis.

5. Ensure that the instruction exploring 'interconnectedness' between the premise and hypothesis includes considerations of source or origin of information or belief, not merely the events or facts themselves.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Your task is to analyze the premise and hypothesis given to you. Carefully consider every detail provided in the sentences. Your objective is to confirm if the hypothesis is a logical outcome of the premise by choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Be sure to consider all possible inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise is important and must be logically compared or contrasted with the hypothesis. Please remember, the identicality of the subject in the premise and hypothesis doesn't necessarily imply entailment. Also, the assumption in the premise may not always directly apply to the hypothesis. Understand the context and ensure there is logical consistency in your conclusion. Your answer must be an outcome of a detailed examination of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Finally, your response should be placed between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The model seems to have misunderstood the relationship between premise and hypothesis. In the premise, we have a chain of beliefs where "Taylor believes that Joseph knows". In the hypothesis, we only have the part "Joseph knows". The model failed to consider that 'belief' does not constitute 'fact'. Just because Taylor believes that Joseph knows something, it doesn't necessarily mean Joseph does indeed know. As such, the entailment is not correct. This reveals one of the weaknesses in the prompt: the cautionary note about identical subjects in the premise and hypothesis not guaranteeing entailment needs to be more explicit for the model.

Wrong Example 2:
In this case, the premise was "Ava suspects that James believes that an elderly Man wearing a olive green shirt and red and white striped apron is stacking cheese". However, the hypothesis simplifies this statement to be "James believes that an elderly Man wearing a olive green shirt and red and white striped apron is stacking cheese". Again, the model made the error of treating 'suspicion' as evidence of 'belief', which is not the case in logic. The model does not seem to understand the difference between someone suspecting another person of a belief and that person truly holding that belief. This highlights the need for the prompt to give more emphasis on differentiating between 'facts', 'belief', and 'suspicion'.

Ways to improve the prompts:

1. More explicitly stress that identical subjects, objects, or attributes in the premise and hypothesis do not guarantee entailment because the nature of the statement can change the context entirely.

2. Clearly differentiate between facts, beliefs, and suspicions. The model needs to understand that a suspicion or a belief does not make something a fact.

3. Encourage the model to scrutinize the difference between the premise and the hypothesis more carefully, paying attention to any differing components that might alter the message being conveyed.

4. Include more context about what 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' mean. 'Entailment' is a strict, logical relationship, and suspicion or belief does not guarantee it.

5. Ask the model to consider the specific levels of subjectivity in each statement and their implications on the direct correspondence of the premise and hypothesis.

6. Make sure the model understands that every word within the premise and the hypothesis matters, and changing one can significantly change the relationship between the two.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to meticulously analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Ensure you contemplate all potential inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise holds value and must be logically weighed against the hypothesis. Be cautious that an identical subject in the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The assumptions in the premise may not always have a direct correspondence with the hypothesis. Always consider the exact roles entities play in both sentences and check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis. Pay close attention to whether the premise and the hypothesis maintain a logical and sequential consistency in their events or facts. Place yourself in different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief' for a more nuanced understanding of the information conveyed. As you deliberate, keep in mind the context, and verify that your conclusion is logically consistent. The ideal conclusion is a result of an in-depth exploration of the interconnectedness between the premise and the hypothesis, where the order of operations and the linearity of scenarios are adequately considered. Wrap your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava suspects that James believes that an elderly Man wearing a olive green shirt and red and white striped apron is stacking cheese. Hypothesis: James believes that an elderly Man wearing a olive green shirt and red and white striped apron is stacking cheese.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
The model seems to have misunderstood the relationship between premise and hypothesis. In the premise, we have a chain of beliefs where "Taylor believes that Joseph knows". In the hypothesis, we only have the part "Joseph knows". The model failed to consider that 'belief' does not constitute 'fact'. Just because Taylor believes that Joseph knows something, it doesn't necessarily mean Joseph does indeed know. As such, the entailment is not correct. This reveals one of the weaknesses in the prompt: the cautionary note about identical subjects in the premise and hypothesis not guaranteeing entailment needs to be more explicit for the model.

Wrong Example 2:
In this case, the premise was "Ava suspects that James believes that an elderly Man wearing a olive green shirt and red and white striped apron is stacking cheese". However, the hypothesis simplifies this statement to be "James believes that an elderly Man wearing a olive green shirt and red and white striped apron is stacking cheese". Again, the model made the error of treating 'suspicion' as evidence of 'belief', which is not the case in logic. The model does not seem to understand the difference between someone suspecting another person of a belief and that person truly holding that belief. This highlights the need for the prompt to give more emphasis on differentiating between 'facts', 'belief', and 'suspicion'.

Ways to improve the prompts:

1. More explicitly stress that identical subjects, objects, or attributes in the premise and hypothesis do not guarantee entailment because the nature of the statement can change the context entirely.

2. Clearly differentiate between facts, beliefs, and suspicions. The model needs to understand that a suspicion or a belief does not make something a fact.

3. Encourage the model to scrutinize the difference between the premise and the hypothesis more carefully, paying attention to any differing components that might alter the message being conveyed.

4. Include more context about what 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' mean. 'Entailment' is a strict, logical relationship, and suspicion or belief does not guarantee it.

5. Ask the model to consider the specific levels of subjectivity in each statement and their implications on the direct correspondence of the premise and hypothesis.

6. Make sure the model understands that every word within the premise and the hypothesis matters, and changing one can significantly change the relationship between the two.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Your task is to analyze the premise and hypothesis given to you. Carefully consider every detail provided in the sentences. Your objective is to confirm if the hypothesis is a logical outcome of the premise by choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Be sure to consider all possible inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise is important and must be logically compared or contrasted with the hypothesis. Please remember, the identicality of the subject in the premise and hypothesis doesn't necessarily imply entailment. Also, the assumption in the premise may not always directly apply to the hypothesis. Understand the context and ensure there is logical consistency in your conclusion. Your answer must be an outcome of a detailed examination of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Finally, your response should be placed between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to meticulously analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your role revolves around critical examination and understanding of a given premise and its related hypothesis. You are required to delve into the specifics of the information provided - major and minor. Remember, the quality of your analysis rests on the consideration of different aspects of the statements such as: the factual nature, the presence of any suspicions or beliefs, and even the specifics of the syntax in relation to the sentences. With this analysis, make a logical determination as to whether the hypothesis is a valid inference that can be drawn from the premise. The relationship between the two can either be termed as an 'entailment' or a 'non-entailment'. When assessing these possibilities, dig deep into the premise to uncover all potential reflections on the hypothesis. Keep in mind that each fragment of information in the premise is a potential clue that should be contextually matched against the hypothesis. Beware! An identical subject or object in the premise and hypothesis does not necessarily establish entailment. Equally, beliefs or suspicions inferred in the premise don't make them fact in the hypothesis. Consistently account for the exact parts entities take in both statements, ensuring their roles remain constant from premise to hypothesis. Consider the logical and sequential consistency in the events or facts within your premise and hypothesis. Take on diverse perspectives such as viewing statements as a 'fact,' a 'suspicion,' or a 'belief' for comprehensive understanding. In your contemplation, also factor in the greater context, ensuring that your final determination is logical and consistent. Your goal is to reach an optimal conclusion that arises from an exhaustive study of the connectivity between the premise and hypothesis. This includes the chronology of operations and scenarios that have to be logically coherent with the hypothesis. When you have selected from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, you are not just matching subjects or objects but evaluating if the hypothesis is a genuine logical conclusion of the premise based on every word and the specified context. <END>

gradient:
<1> 
The model's response to the input prompt is incorrect. It has selected "entailment" instead of the correct answer "non-entailment". This might be due to how the sentences in the premise and the hypothesis are framed. Both sentences share similar elements, which may have led the model to an incorrect entailment conclusion. It appears that the model has not fully grasped the importance of evaluating the role entities play in both sentences, as instructed by the prompt. Notably, even though James assumes in both sentences, the contents of his assumptions are different. This subtlety could have been overlooked by the model.

<2>
The model's incorrect answer to this question presents an interesting situation. It predicted "non-entailment" whereas the correct answer is "entailment". It seems that the model has failed to discern the overall contextual and thematic consistency behind the premise and the hypothesis. Despite the variance in details (like location), the core activity in both sentences is the same — a young woman reading.

Possible improvements:

1. Elaborate the meaning of entailment and non-entailment in the prompt. Clearly define 'entailment' as when the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the premise. Conversely, 'non-entailment' means the premise does not necessarily imply the hypothesis.

2. Highlight the importance of context, inference, and overall thematic consistency, even in the absence of identical subjects or scenarios.

3. Guide the model to consider the depth of differences or similarities, particularly in regard to the contents of assumptions or beliefs.

4. Encourage the exploration of variances within similar themes, and not just focusing on the sequence of events or facts mentioned in the premise and the hypothesis.

5. Reinforce the idea that the perspective (suspicion, fact, belief) can switch between the premise and the hypothesis, which should be taken into account when deciding on entailment or non-entailment.

6. Stress that a lack of detailed correspondence between the premise and hypothesis doesn't automatically suggest non-entailment.

Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Ensure you contemplate all potential inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise holds value and must be logically weighed against the hypothesis. Be cautious that an identical subject in the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The assumptions in the premise may not always have a direct correspondence with the hypothesis. Always consider the exact roles entities play in both sentences and check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis. Pay close attention to whether the premise and the hypothesis maintain a logical and sequential consistency in their events or facts. Place yourself in different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief' for a more nuanced understanding of the information conveyed. As you deliberate, keep in mind the context, and verify that your conclusion is logically consistent. The ideal conclusion is a result of an in-depth exploration of the interconnectedness between the premise and the hypothesis, where the order of operations and the linearity of scenarios are adequately considered. Wrap your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert knows that a young woman dressed up semi-formally is reading book and drinking in the sun, seated on a bench. Hypothesis: Robert knows that a young woman reads near the ocean.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
The model's response to the input prompt is incorrect. It has selected "entailment" instead of the correct answer "non-entailment". This might be due to how the sentences in the premise and the hypothesis are framed. Both sentences share similar elements, which may have led the model to an incorrect entailment conclusion. It appears that the model has not fully grasped the importance of evaluating the role entities play in both sentences, as instructed by the prompt. Notably, even though James assumes in both sentences, the contents of his assumptions are different. This subtlety could have been overlooked by the model.

<2>
The model's incorrect answer to this question presents an interesting situation. It predicted "non-entailment" whereas the correct answer is "entailment". It seems that the model has failed to discern the overall contextual and thematic consistency behind the premise and the hypothesis. Despite the variance in details (like location), the core activity in both sentences is the same — a young woman reading.

Possible improvements:

1. Elaborate the meaning of entailment and non-entailment in the prompt. Clearly define 'entailment' as when the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the premise. Conversely, 'non-entailment' means the premise does not necessarily imply the hypothesis.

2. Highlight the importance of context, inference, and overall thematic consistency, even in the absence of identical subjects or scenarios.

3. Guide the model to consider the depth of differences or similarities, particularly in regard to the contents of assumptions or beliefs.

4. Encourage the exploration of variances within similar themes, and not just focusing on the sequence of events or facts mentioned in the premise and the hypothesis.

5. Reinforce the idea that the perspective (suspicion, fact, belief) can switch between the premise and the hypothesis, which should be taken into account when deciding on entailment or non-entailment.

6. Stress that a lack of detailed correspondence between the premise and hypothesis doesn't automatically suggest non-entailment.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis carefully, considering all parts and details of the sentences. Based on reasoning and inference, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise by choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Don't overlook any inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Treat each segment of the premise as valuable information and connect or disconnect it logically with the hypothesis to determine the relationship. Make sure your answer reflects a thorough evaluation of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, by considering the context and logical consistency as well. Your answer option should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.
(2) Your task is to analyze the premise and hypothesis given to you. Carefully consider every detail provided in the sentences. Your objective is to confirm if the hypothesis is a logical outcome of the premise by choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Be sure to consider all possible inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise is important and must be logically compared or contrasted with the hypothesis. Please remember, the identicality of the subject in the premise and hypothesis doesn't necessarily imply entailment. Also, the assumption in the premise may not always directly apply to the hypothesis. Understand the context and ensure there is logical consistency in your conclusion. Your answer must be an outcome of a detailed examination of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Finally, your response should be placed between <answer> and </answer>.

In this task, your goal is to conduct a nuanced analysis of both the given premise and hypothesis. Examine each sentence and every detail therein, understanding the significance of factors like the types of statements - whether they are facts, suspicions, or beliefs. Also, bear in mind the roles, the relative positions, and the directionalities of the relations within these sentences. By analyzing all these factors, you have to arrive at a conclusion about whether the hypothesis is logically derived from the premise. This conclusion will either be 'entailment', suggesting that the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', indicating the premise doesn't necessarily imply the hypothesis. Ponder over all possible inferences that the premise might suggest. Remember to factor in each piece of data from the premise, weighing it, logically, against the hypothesis. Be watchful not to be swayed by similar subjects in both the premise and the hypothesis, as this doesn't always ensure entailment. Likewise, don't automatically assume non-entailment simply because direct correspondences between the premise and the hypothesis are lacking. It's vital to consider the exact roles that the various entities play in both the premise and the hypothesis, checking their consistency when moving from one to the other. Monitor the premise and hypothesis for a logical sequence and consistency in their events or statements. Adopt varied perspectives such as 'fact', 'suspicion', or 'belief' to gain a more rounded understanding of the conveyed information. Keep the context in mind during your deliberations and verify that your conclusion maintains logical coherence. The most desirable conclusion is a product of a deep dive into the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, considering the order and the linearity of the scenarios. Once you have made your decision, bracket it between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this example, the model incorrectly identifies the relationship as an 'entailment'. It's crucial to note that the model fails to distinguish between third-party beliefs and factual relationships. While Abigail believes that Ava believes something, it doesn't necessarily mean that Abigail also believes that same thing. The model seems to disregard these levels of indirection.

<2> Similarly to the first example, the model fails to distinguish between the belief about someone else's knowledge and the actual knowledge. Just because Abigail believes that Emma knows something, it doesn't entail that Emma actually knows it.

<3> For this example, the pattern continues. The model incorrectly assumes just because James assumes that Thomas suspects something, it means that Thomas actually suspects it. The model doesn't account for these degrees of separation in belief and speculation.

<4> As with the previous examples, the model doesn't discern between what Abigail assumes about James' thoughts and what James actually thinks.

For all these incorrect predictions, it becomes clear that the prompt doesn't adequately clarify the nuances of indirect beliefs, assumptions and suspicions. The model interprets these indirect beliefs as clear, factual entailments, which is not always the case, leading to the misclassification of 'entailment' when the answer should be 'non-entailment'.

To improve the prompt, it could include the clarification that the belief or assumption of one person about another person's belief or knowledge does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis regarding the second person's belief or knowledge can be inferred from the premise. The prompt could be more explicit about evaluating the indirect relationships mentioned in the premise to assess whether they provide sufficient grounds to conclude an entailment relationship. Overall, incorporating this level of sophistication into the prompt should improve the model's handling of these nuanced logical relationships.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

The model got the example wrong because it did not properly factor in the logical structure of the sentences presented. Specifically, it didn't consider the nested assumptions correctly. Charles 'assuming' does not mean that the events being assumed are factually true or taking place; hence it cannot logically entail that David 'suspects'. The prompt failed to direct the model's attention towards handling nested beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions.

Example 2:

This error is very similar to the one in the first example. Charlotte's belief about Amelia's belief does not logically entail Charlotte's independent belief about the same event. The prompt did not properly instruct the language model to take into account this complexity and hierarchy of beliefs.

Example 3:

Once again, the language model wrongly inferred entailment from John's suspicion about Taylor's thinking. This is a complex logical structure that the prompt did not successfully explain to the model. 

For improving the prompt, following aspects can be considered:
1. It should include explicit guidance on how to handle sentences that express nested beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions. 
2. It should underscore that an entailment requires the premise to provide solid evidence, not just a hint or suspicion, that the hypothesis is true.
3. It should also highlight that an entailment from one person's belief to another person's belief cannot be inferred unless there's evidence that the second person's belief indeed depends on the first one's.
4. It should have explicit directions on how to process and evaluate complex logical structures and relationships.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Example one: The mistake in the model's prediction appears to stem from a misunderstanding of perspective in the sentences. Though the premise discusses what Abigail sees Sophia thinking, the hypothesis flips this perspective, discussing what Sophia thinks Abigail perceives. The model seems to miss this distinction and assumes the relational dynamic stays constant between premise and hypothesis, which it does not. 

2) Example two: Similar to the first example, the model does not correctly interpret the change in perspective from the premise to the hypothesis. The original statement is about what Emma understands about Michael's thoughts, whereas the hypothesis is about what Michael believes Emma understands. This difference subtly changes the implications of the sentences and therefore their relationship to each other.

3) Example three: Again, the model’s issue lies in failing to distinguish the shift in perspectives. The premise speaks from Emma's viewpoint watching John's thoughts, whereas the hypothesis is about John’s viewpoint on what Emma sees. These are not equivalent statements or viewpoints, but the model purportedly fails to recognize this nuanced change and, as a result, incorrectly labels it as entailment. 

Based on these wrong answers, several improvements can be made to the prompt:

1) Clarification on perspective: Give clearer guidance on the distinction between different perspectives, and how a shift in perspective between the premise and the hypothesis can drastically change the inference.

2) Breakdown of entailment: Describe entailment in a more nuanced way, indicating that for a premise to entail a hypothesis, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, without alterations in viewpoint or subject.

3) Encourage closer readings: Stress the importance of comparing the exact wording, structure, and perspectives in both the premise and the hypothesis.

4) Increase contextual understanding: Improve the overall understanding of context, implication, and inference in terms of language use, for better comprehension and decision-making.

By taking these considerations into account, the prompt may be able to more accurately guide the language model in evaluating the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

<1> 
The model's input is:
Based on the premise and hypothesis provided, evaluate the logical relationship between them. Pay close attention to the perspectives of the subjects, considering that a shift in subject perspective can change the meaning. Label it as 'entailment' if the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided, and 'non-entailment' if not.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia believes that Ava remembers that a young boy in green is practicing kicking. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that a young boy in green is practicing kicking.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

Question: Premise: Olivia believes that Ava remembers that a young boy in green is practicing kicking. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that a young boy in green is practicing kicking. 

The model's incorrect answer: (B) non-entailment 

Correct answer: (A) entailment 

Why the model might have made an error: 
1. Context Complexity: The premise in the question deals with multiple levels of perception (Olivia's belief about Ava's memory), which might have led the language model to misjudge the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

2. Overemphasis on structure and viewpoint: The prompt emphasizes that the structure and viewpoint of the premise and the hypothesis should remain unchanged for them to be classified as entailment. This may have caused the model to incorrectly label this example as non-entailment since the hypothesis did not reproduce the entire structure of the premise (omission of Ava's memory in the hypothesis).

3. Lack of clarity in the definitions: The prompt defines entailment as when the "truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided." Here, the "exactness" might be interpreted on the level of content rather than the logical structure. This may lead the model to incorrectly classify sentences as non-entailment even though the premise logically implies the hypothesis.

Improvement for the prompt:

1. Simplify Context Complexity: Provide definitions or examples that address nested beliefs or memories, which would help the model understand the more complex logical relationships.

2. Adjust Emphasis: Re-emphasize that viewpoint and structure should be compared primarily on a logical rather than a strictly textual level.

3. Clarify Definitions: Make definitions more explicit, particularly around the exactness in structure. For example, clarify that entailment refers to the logical implication rather than an identical reprisal of the structure or content. 

4. Encourage Critical Analysis: Include in the prompt a directive to examine whether the essence of the premise remains true in the hypothesis, regardless of shifts in the structure or viewpoint of the statement. 

5. Introduce more options: Introduce options other than just 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' which allows for more nuanced responses. For instance, an 'ambiguous' option for instances where the relationship isn't straightforward.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Based on the premise and hypothesis provided, evaluate the logical relationship between them. Pay close attention to the perspectives of the subjects, considering that a shift in subject perspective can change the meaning. Label it as 'entailment' if the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided, and 'non-entailment' if not. Look closely at the exact wording, structure, context, and perspectives in both the premise and the hypothesis to make your selection. Choose your response from the provided options and present your answer enclosed in <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Based on the premise and hypothesis provided, evaluate the logical relationship between them. Pay close attention to the perspectives of the subjects, considering that a shift in subject perspective can change the meaning. Label it as 'entailment' if the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided, and 'non-entailment' if not. Look closely at the exact wording, structure, context, and perspectives in both the premise and the hypothesis to make your selection. Choose your response from the provided options and present your answer enclosed in <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia believes that Ava remembers that a young boy in green is practicing kicking. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that a young boy in green is practicing kicking.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1: 

Question: Premise: Olivia believes that Ava remembers that a young boy in green is practicing kicking. Hypothesis: Olivia believes that a young boy in green is practicing kicking. 

The model's incorrect answer: (B) non-entailment 

Correct answer: (A) entailment 

Why the model might have made an error: 
1. Context Complexity: The premise in the question deals with multiple levels of perception (Olivia's belief about Ava's memory), which might have led the language model to misjudge the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

2. Overemphasis on structure and viewpoint: The prompt emphasizes that the structure and viewpoint of the premise and the hypothesis should remain unchanged for them to be classified as entailment. This may have caused the model to incorrectly label this example as non-entailment since the hypothesis did not reproduce the entire structure of the premise (omission of Ava's memory in the hypothesis).

3. Lack of clarity in the definitions: The prompt defines entailment as when the "truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided." Here, the "exactness" might be interpreted on the level of content rather than the logical structure. This may lead the model to incorrectly classify sentences as non-entailment even though the premise logically implies the hypothesis.

Improvement for the prompt:

1. Simplify Context Complexity: Provide definitions or examples that address nested beliefs or memories, which would help the model understand the more complex logical relationships.

2. Adjust Emphasis: Re-emphasize that viewpoint and structure should be compared primarily on a logical rather than a strictly textual level.

3. Clarify Definitions: Make definitions more explicit, particularly around the exactness in structure. For example, clarify that entailment refers to the logical implication rather than an identical reprisal of the structure or content. 

4. Encourage Critical Analysis: Include in the prompt a directive to examine whether the essence of the premise remains true in the hypothesis, regardless of shifts in the structure or viewpoint of the statement. 

5. Introduce more options: Introduce options other than just 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' which allows for more nuanced responses. For instance, an 'ambiguous' option for instances where the relationship isn't straightforward.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Misinterpretation: The model might have misinterpreted the instruction "the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis." Despite the instructions asking the model to consider shifts in subject perspective, it seems that it has glossed over the fact that the hypothesis is only true in Robert's perspective, not necessarily in reality.

2. Overemphasis on Subject Perspective: It may be due to the strong emphasis on the instructions for contemplating subject perspective that led the model in considering that Robert's belief validates Amelia's recognition. Despite asking the model to attribute significant importance to shifts in subject perspective, the model may incorrectly perceive it as self-evident that Robert's beliefs are identical to Amelia's perceptions.

3. Failure to Recognize the Uncertainty: The model fails to recognize that Robert’s belief about what Amelia recognizes does not necessarily mean Amelia does recognize it. There's a possibility that the model saw the direct transposition of perception into the hypothesis, interpreting it as an assertion rather than a belief.

To improve the prompt:

1. Clear Assumptions: Make it clear that the perspective held by one subject doesn't necessarily confirm the theory from the viewpoint of another.

2. Define Entailment: Offer a better understanding of 'entailment,' that belief cannot confirm the truth, and the hypothesis must be valid in all perspectives, not just from one viewpoint.

3. Highlight Subjectivity: Explicitly instruct the model to treat beliefs and perspectives of different subjects as subjective and to not establish them as facts.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, model's incorrect inference led to the wrong decision. The hypothesis mentions that the guy is outside in the snow, which is implied in the premise statement that a guy in a red jacket is snowboarding in midair - snowboarding generally takes places in snowy outdoor weather conditions. 

<2> 
Here, the model fails to differentiate between "Charlotte's assumption about Michael's assumption" and "Michael's assumption." It cannot be automatically inferred that if "Charlotte assumes that Michael assumes something", then "Michael actually assumes that thing". These are perceptions and we can't determine the accuracy of a perception based on another perception.

<3> 
In this case, the model again falls into the trap of interpreting "Olivia's suspicion about Joseph's belief" as "Olivia's suspicion". Similar to the second example, one cannot unequivocally infer the truth of a person's suspicion from another person's suspicion about that suspicion.

The current prompt needs improvement in the following ways:

1. Instructions: Make instructions more explicit and precise. In particular, make the boundary between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' clearer.

2. Definition: Specify the definition of 'entailment' more finely and detail what kind of relationship between the premise and the hypothesis would fall into 'entailment' category.

3. Perspective: Add more emphasis on the perspectives of the subjects. Make it clear that psychological verbs like "assume", "believe", "suspect" etc. often introduce a perspective that can change the meaning.

4. Examples: Include examples to illustrate these complex points, especially examples that demonstrate how changes in subject perspective, psychological states and intermediary agents can influence the relationship between premises and hypotheses.

5. Avoiding Assumptions: The AI model should not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the information given in the premise. Thus, a reminder should be added that pushes the AI model to avoid such assumptions.

6. Logic: Instructional reinforcement about logical and illogical conclusions could be beneficial for the AI's decision making.

7. Nested Statements: Encourage the AI to treat nested statements individually and analyze their relationship with other parts of the premise and hypothesis. 

8. Questions: Modify the question to prompt the AI with "Does the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantee the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided?", to force it to think critically about entailment. 

9. Context: Emphasize to take into account of not only literal meanings but also implicit implications and conventional associations based on the context.

These are perceptions and we can't determine the accuracy of a perception based on another perception.

<3> 
In this case, the model again falls into the trap of interpreting "Olivia's suspicion about Joseph's belief" as "Olivia's suspicion". Similar to the second example, one cannot unequivocally infer the truth of a person's suspicion from another person's suspicion about that suspicion.

The current prompt needs improvement in the following ways:

1. Instructions: Make instructions more explicit and precise. In particular, make the boundary between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' clearer.

2. Definition: Specify the definition of 'entailment' more finely and detail what kind of relationship between the premise and the hypothesis would fall into 'entailment' category.

3. Perspective: Add more emphasis on the perspectives of the subjects. Make it clear that psychological verbs like "assume", "believe", "suspect" etc. often introduce a perspective that can change the meaning.

4. Examples: Include examples to illustrate these complex points, especially examples that demonstrate how changes in subject perspective, psychological states and intermediary agents can influence the relationship between premises and hypotheses.

5. Avoiding Assumptions: The AI model should not make assumptions that are not explicitly stated in the information given in the premise. Thus, a reminder should be added that pushes the AI model to avoid such assumptions.

6. Logic: Instructional reinforcement about logical and illogical conclusions could be beneficial for the AI's decision making.

7. Nested Statements: Encourage the AI to treat nested statements individually and analyze their relationship with other parts of the premise and hypothesis. 

8. Questions: Modify the question to prompt the AI with "Does the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantee the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided?", to force it to think critically about entailment. 

9. Context: Emphasize to take into account of not only literal meanings but also implicit implications and conventional associations based on the context.

(2) Based on the premise and hypothesis provided, evaluate the logical relationship between them. Pay close attention to the perspectives of the subjects, considering that a shift in subject perspective can change the meaning. Label it as 'entailment' if the truth of the premise unequivocally guarantees the truth of the hypothesis in the exact structure and viewpoint as provided, and 'non-entailment' if not. Look closely at the exact wording, structure, context, and perspectives in both the premise and the hypothesis to make your selection.

Understand 'entailment' as a situation where the truth of the premise undeniably warrants the exact truth of the hypothesis in the same structure and viewpoint given. In cases where this doesn't hold, label as 'non-entailment'. When deriving the relationship, consider not only the language used and the context but also the psychological verbs such as "assumes", "believes" or "suspects" as they often introduce new perspectives. Avoid making unsupported assumptions. Bear in mind that a nested statement's relationship with other parts of the premise and hypothesis can influence the conclusion derived. When evaluating whether the supposed relationship is of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', ponder this question - "Does the premise's truth conclusively certify the hypothesis's truth as provided, without any shift in subjects' perspectives or structure?"

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Reason: 

The prompt emphasizes on the level of indirectness in beliefs and assumptions which could lead to confusion. In this example, it may have pointed the AI to focus more on the part in the premise where it says "Ava learns that two men renovate a brick wall outside". The AI may misconstrued this as extra information that makes it separate from the hypothesis. However, the hypothesis is in fact entailed in the premise, regardless of Ava's involvement.

Amendment: The prompt should simplify its instruction by focusing on the underlying relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. An indirect belief or assumption is not always a factor of non-entailment, so highlighting this might mislead the AI.

2) Reason:

While the prompt emphasizes the ‘indirectness’ in the belief or assumption, it does not clearly explain what’ll happen if the belief presented in the premise is a direct belief, as seen in the example. This may lead to inaccurate entailment detection.

Amendment: There should be a clear reference to what is expected when the belief or assumption is directly inferred from the premise. Although there is a brief mention on this, a clearer explanation can help in its understanding.

3) Reason:

The prompt might be leading the model towards an assumption that there needs to be an equal level of depth or detail in the premise and the hypothesis for it to be an `entailment`. Here, the premise involves a third person (Ava) which might lead the model to think the hypothesis does not entail from the premise because it doesn't mention Ava.

Amendment: The prompt can include explicit clarification that even if the premise has more detail or elements (like introducing another person or entity), it doesn't necessarily negate 'entailment.' 

Improvements based on reasons:

1. Don't overemphasize the indirectness on beliefs and assumptions, because it's not the sole factor to categorize it as a non-entailment.

2. Clearly state the expectations when there's a direct belief or assumption inferred from the premise.

3. Clarify that difference in depth or details in premise and hypothesis does not automatically negate 'entailment.'

gradient:
Example <1>:
In this case, the crucial point is that even though Robert believes that Emma believes something, this does not necessarily mean that Emma does actually believe it. However, the model interprets the "'entailment' if the hypothesis can be directly and reasonably inferred from the premise" part in the prompt as if Robert's belief about Emma's belief makes it an entailment, leading to the wrong response.

Example <2>:
Similarly, Charles's suspicion that Olivia knows something doesn't entail that Olivia actually knows it. Even so, the model incorrectly selects 'entailment' when it should be 'non-entailment'. This error may be due to the same interpretation of the prompt that any belief or assumption about another person's belief, knowledge, or thoughts equals entailment.

Improving the Prompt:

Based on the mistaken interpretations above, the prompt can be improved with the following changes:

1. Specify that a person's belief or assumption about another's belief, knowledge, or thoughts doesn't automatically lead to an 'entailment'. People's beliefs or assumptions about others can be inaccurate.

2. Explicitly state that 'entailment' should correlate with a solid, indisputable logical conclusion from premise to hypothesis. If there's any degree of uncertainty, the model should categorize it as 'non-entailment'. 

3. Provide examples in the prompt to illustrate when to use 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', including examples such as those discussed above, where one person has beliefs or assumptions about another's mind.

Revised Prompt:
Evaluate the logical relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, considering the degree of certainty. If the hypothesis can be irrefutably inferred from the premise, categorize it as 'entailment'. However, if there is ambiguity or suspected indirectness, such as a situation where the premise is based on one person's belief or assumption about another's belief or knowledge, the result should be 'non-entailment'.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Lack of Clarity in Instructions: The prompt is long and complicated, which may confuse the model, leading to an incorrect decision. There are several instructions about indirect beliefs, assumptions, and nuances, which can make it hard for the model to clearly classify the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. In the given example, the model wrongly classified the response as 'non-entailment', evidently misunderstanding the instructions. 

2. Neglect of Basic Principle: The prompt seems to overemphasize indirectness. This could have led to the model interpreting the prompt in such a way that it did not consider the straightforward logical connection between the premise and hypothesis in the example. The premise and hypothesis given are essentially the same in different phrasing, meaning this should be classified as 'entailment', which the model failed to do.

3. Misinterpretation of Possible Scenarios: The prompt can be improved by providing clear criteria for 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The instructions are overly specific about indirect beliefs in a way that may mislead the model into seeing an indirect belief where there is none. This could have resulted in the model choosing 'non-entailment' in the example because of a possible misperception of indirectness.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Shorten and Simplify: Trim down the prompt and remove overly complex language. Making the instructions concise and clear may help the model interpret it correctly.

2. Clear Entailment Criteria: Leave rules for entailment and non-entailment unambiguous and broad to cover all potential scenarios.

3. Balance Emphasis: Limit the emphasis on indirect beliefs and assumptions as it may misdirect the model's focus. Be careful about getting too specific about possible situations.

4. Provide Examples: Include examples of correct usage to guide the model's understanding.

gradient:
For each wrong example, let’s examine the premise, hypothesis, and the model's misinterpretation:

Example 1:
Premise: Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.
Hypothesis: Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping.
The model incorrectly interprets this as 'entailment'. It seems that the model focused on the similarity in the actions described — Emma suspecting that three kids perform a skit about camping — rather than the complete logic chain. In reality, Ava's belief is an extra layer of uncertainty that makes the hypothesis not directly implied by the premise, hence it should be 'non-entailment’.

Example 2:
Premise: Taylor thinks that Olivia recognizes that a man does a skating trick off of graffiti-filled stairs.
Hypothesis: Olivia recognizes that a man does a skating trick off of graffiti-filled stairs.
Here the model made the same mistake, focusing on the action of Olivia recognizing that a man does a skating trick off stairs rather than the full logical chain. Similar to the first example, Taylor's thinking does not directly imply Olivia's recognition, which leads to a 'non-entailment' relationship.

From these examples, the following potential issues with the prompt are raised:

1. Too broad: The prompt's language may be too broad, leading the model to sometimes overlook specific details.

2. Overemphasis on action similarity: The prompt appears to cause the model to heavily focus on the similarity of actions between the hypothesis and the premise, incorrectly leading to 'entailment' outputs if the actions are the same.

3. Neglect of indirect relationships: The model does not properly account for indirect relationships posed by subjective sentiments like 'thinks', 'believes'.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Specify that the model should pay close attention to the entire logical chain from the premise to the hypothesis. Encourage it to consider indirect relationships, not just direct actions.

2. Include additional guidance asking the model to discern differences due to feelings, beliefs, or perceptions.

3. Remind the model that the relationship must be directly implied within the same logical step to be 'entailment', otherwise it is 'non-entailment'.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model incorrectly shows an 'entailment' relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The prompt instructs the model to determine a causal relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the premise states that an idea is believed by a third party, not the person who holds the idea itself. This indirect relationship is complicated and may not always lead to entailment. 

<2> 
Similarly, the model gets the second example wrong due to the same issue. The premise states that Amelia 'suspects' something about Sophia, which doesn’t directly establish the truth of Sophia's thoughts. 

<3>
This example showcases the same issue, where the premise is based on William's assumption, not on Emma's direct observation. This also shows the premise and hypothesis don't entail each other. 

<4>
In this example, the model errs again by failing to realize that the premise is based on Charles's beliefs about Isabella's recognition, not the recognition itself. 

In each of the above examples, the model fails to correctly interpret indirect relationships. In all the failed instances, the subject of the premise (e.g., Michael, Amelia, William, and Charles) is not the same as the subject of the hypothesis. The model seems to not distinguish between when an action or belief is recognized or suspected by another person, which may not necessarily imply that the action or belief is factual.  

The following aspects could improve the prompt:

1. Clarify these cases where the beliefs or assumptions of one person about another's recognition or thoughts do not necessarily imply the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. The model needs to appreciate the nuance between direct claim and a claim that is filtered through another's perception.
2. Provide examples where a premise is based on the perception of a third party to help guide the model in understanding this indirect form of relationship.
3. Explicitly explain that when the premise and hypothesis have different subjects, the relationship may not be entailment.

gradient:
<1>
Problem: The prompt asks the model to determine if the hypothesis is "directly implied by the premise." In this case, the premise involves a third party (Isabella) who is assuming something about Olivia. The hypothesis only directly involves Olivia, removing Isabella from the equation. The model seems to fail to account for the nuance of this third party involvement and how it affects the nature of the information being presented in the premise.

Solution: The prompt should emphasize the importance of considering the nuance of third party involvement in the premise.

<2>
Problem: Similar to the previous example, the premise involves a third party - "Michael recognizes." The hypothesis, however, flips who is recognizing what. The model seems to struggle with understanding the role change between the two sentences.

Solution: The prompt should provide more explicit reminders for the model to consider the perspective and actors involved in each sentence.

<3>
Problem: As in the previous examples, there is a third party involved in the premise that is not in the hypothesis. The model seems to struggle with understanding the difference between "Thomas assumes" and "Robert believes", treating these as equivalent when they are not.

Solution: The prompt should remind the model to consider the sources of the presented information and whether the source changes between the premise and hypothesis.

Summary:
1. The prompt should emphasize considerations of the source of the information presented. If a third party is making an assumption in the premise, the hypothesis must also contain this assumption for it to be considered "entailment."
2. The prompt should remind the model to closely consider changes in the perspective between the premise and the hypothesis. For example, if the premise is about what one person recognizes about another, the hypothesis that flips who is recognizing what is not entailed, because the perspective has changed.
3. The prompt should provide explicit reminders for the model to pay attention to role changes between the premise and the hypothesis. It seems to struggle with understanding when roles or perspectives change between the premise and hypothesis.

If the subject of the premise and the subject of the hypothesis are different, this could be a clue that the relationship is not entailment. Always review nuanced details and abstract concepts affecting the relationship. Once you finish your analysis, present your choice as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', bracketed elaborately between <answer> and </answer>.

gradient:
<1> 
In this question, the model is failing to acknowledge that Emma's assumption doesn't necessarily mirror Joseph's belief. The prompt needs to clarify that the beliefs or thoughts of one person do not automatically signify that another person also holds the same beliefs or thoughts.

<2> 
The model incorrectly assumes that Ava's suspicion is equal to Amelia's understanding. The prompt needs to clarify that assumptions, suspicions, beliefs, or perceptions of one person about another's recognition or thoughts do not necessarily equal the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. 

<3> 
In this situation, the artificial intelligence incorrectly presumes that Richard's suspicion about Abigail's belief establishes the hypothesized scenario as valid. The prompt does touch on this point, stating that people's perceptions about another's thoughts or recognitions don’t necessarily certify the truth of those thoughts. But, this perspective is misinterpreted by the AI model, leading to the incorrect answer.

<4> 
Here, the model wrongly identifies Robert's suspicion as factual. The prompt needs to emphasize that a person's views about another's recognition or thoughts don't necessarily confirm the truth of those thoughts or recognitions.

From these mistakes, we can conclude that:

1. The model struggles to understand the nuanced difference between someone's belief about another person's thoughts and the actual thoughts of that person. It often incorrectly deems the former as proof of the latter.
2. The current arrangements of the prompt can be misleading for the model due to the presence of complex, nuanced phrases that the model struggles to interpret accurately.

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:

1. The prompt needs to more clearly express the distinction between a person's assumptions about another's thoughts and the actual thoughts of that individual.
2. Phrases can be simplified to make them more understandable for the model.
3. More explicit examples or guidelines regarding the difference between beliefs about thoughts and the thoughts themselves could also be beneficial.
4. The prompt could benefit from a more direct statement about not equating one person's perceptions, assumption, or suspicion about another's thoughts with the actual thoughts.

gradient:
<1>
In this first example, the error could arise from the ambiguity in the task instructions. While the prompt strictly instructs that a person's perception about another person's thoughts does not imply the truth of those thoughts, the model seems to miss this nuance while interpreting the given premise and hypothesis. The premise states Richard's assumption, which doesn't automatically validate the truth of Abigail's thoughts in the hypothesis.

<2>
A similar issue appears in the second example. The model assumes that because Joseph's belief includes people being on the sidewalk, it automatically validates Emma's beliefs in the hypothesis, despite the differences in context and subjects of the two statements. 

<3>
In the third example, the model seems to have interpreted Thomas's assumption about what Emma learns as a direct implication of Emma indeed learning the same in the hypothesis. This again demonstrates a difficulty in understanding instructions related to third-person assumptions or beliefs about another person's thoughts.

All these examples indicate that the model struggles to accurately interpret instructions regarding third-person beliefs, assumptions, or perceptions. It is often confused by certain conceptual implications, particularly when it comes to understanding the difference between a premise involving someone's belief or assumption and the direct truth stated in a hypothesis.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Stricter Emphasis: The model seems to have trouble understanding the importance of third-party perception influencing the accuracy of the hypothesis. Stating that the belief or assumption of one person about another person's thoughts "never" implies the truth of their thoughts, rather than "may not necessarily", might help clarify this element.

2. Practical Examples: Providing concrete examples in the task instructions could help the model distinguish between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in different contexts, particularly when dealing with assumptions and beliefs involving different subjects.

3. Dissecting the Premise: To improve understanding of the task, it could be explained in simpler language that the premise is formed from two parts: the subject (the person assuming, perceiving, or believing) and the supposed reality (what they perceive, believe, or assume). If these do not match with the hypothesis, it indicates a non-entailment.

4. More Elaboration: Detailing the clues that might point to non-entailment, such as different subjects in the premise and the hypothesis, can also be more elaborated or emphasised in the instructions.

By revising the prompt in this manner, the model could better understand and perform the entailment task in various contexts.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas assumes that Emma learns that a young football player watches a game with his coach. Hypothesis: Emma learns that a young football player watches a game with his coach.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
In this first example, the error could arise from the ambiguity in the task instructions. While the prompt strictly instructs that a person's perception about another person's thoughts does not imply the truth of those thoughts, the model seems to miss this nuance while interpreting the given premise and hypothesis. The premise states Richard's assumption, which doesn't automatically validate the truth of Abigail's thoughts in the hypothesis.

<2>
A similar issue appears in the second example. The model assumes that because Joseph's belief includes people being on the sidewalk, it automatically validates Emma's beliefs in the hypothesis, despite the differences in context and subjects of the two statements. 

<3>
In the third example, the model seems to have interpreted Thomas's assumption about what Emma learns as a direct implication of Emma indeed learning the same in the hypothesis. This again demonstrates a difficulty in understanding instructions related to third-person assumptions or beliefs about another person's thoughts.

All these examples indicate that the model struggles to accurately interpret instructions regarding third-person beliefs, assumptions, or perceptions. It is often confused by certain conceptual implications, particularly when it comes to understanding the difference between a premise involving someone's belief or assumption and the direct truth stated in a hypothesis.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Stricter Emphasis: The model seems to have trouble understanding the importance of third-party perception influencing the accuracy of the hypothesis. Stating that the belief or assumption of one person about another person's thoughts "never" implies the truth of their thoughts, rather than "may not necessarily", might help clarify this element.

2. Practical Examples: Providing concrete examples in the task instructions could help the model distinguish between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in different contexts, particularly when dealing with assumptions and beliefs involving different subjects.

3. Dissecting the Premise: To improve understanding of the task, it could be explained in simpler language that the premise is formed from two parts: the subject (the person assuming, perceiving, or believing) and the supposed reality (what they perceive, believe, or assume). If these do not match with the hypothesis, it indicates a non-entailment.

4. More Elaboration: Detailing the clues that might point to non-entailment, such as different subjects in the premise and the hypothesis, can also be more elaborated or emphasised in the instructions.

By revising the prompt in this manner, the model could better understand and perform the entailment task in various contexts.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the details within each premise and hypothesis, and determine the causal relationship between them. Choose from the options 'entailment', if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', if the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise. Pay particularly close attention to nuanced details and abstract concepts that may influence the relationship. Present your answer as one of the two options at the end, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

response:
<START> The objective is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Distinguish between 'entailment', if the hypothesis is a direct result or consequence of the premise, and 'non-entailment', when the hypothesis has no direct implication from the premise. It's important to realize that the belief, assumption, or perception of one person regarding the thoughts of another person NEVER guarantees the validity of those thoughts. Instead, these are simply interpretations that may or may not correspond to the truth. Also, differences in the subjects in the premise and the hypothesis might denote non-entailment. In simpler terms, the premise is made of two parts: the subject (the person making the assumption) and the belief or perception about reality (the thoughts or occurrence they are interpreting). If these do not align with the hypothesis, it should be classified as 'non-entailment'. As an example, if Peter perceives that Mary thinks that dogs are adorable, it doesn't mean that Mary actually thinks dogs are adorable. Here, 'Peter perceives' is the subject and 'Mary thinks dogs are adorable' is the perceived reality. Although nuanced details and abstract constructs play a critical part in determining the relationship, make sure to pay attention to these details. After you finish your analysis, label your inference as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', neatly contained between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Example 1:
i. In the first wrong example, the model incorrectly labels the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as one of entailment (A). The premise states that Charlotte understands Amelia's belief about a man eating an ice cream cone, whereas the hypothesis repositions Amelia as the person who believes that Charlotte has an understanding of the man eating ice cream. 
ii. The shift of the belief holder between the premise and the hypothesis does not directly imply entailment. While both involve an understanding of a man eating an ice cream, the subject of the belief has altered, hence the implication does not directly follow. 
iii. The existing prompt may have led the model to this incorrect answer by not emphasizing sufficiently on the critical role of the subject in determining entailment. The prompt also might not have stressed enough on the difference between the 'belief/understanding' of different individuals and how it can affect the entailment.

2.  Example 2: 
i. In the second incorrect example, the model erroneously deems the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as one of entailment (A). The premise is about what Charlotte assumes about Robert's assumptions of dogs cruising down the street. The hypothesis, however, simply states Robert's assumption, without mentioning Charlotte.
ii. Even though Robert's assumption appears in both the premise and hypothesis, the change in the subject from the doubly-nested assumption to a simple assumption does not directly imply entailment. 
iii. Again, the existing prompt may not have been clear enough in instructing the model to consider such changes in complexity and nesting of assumptions when determining if entailment exists. 

Potential Improvements to the Prompt:
1. More emphasis should be given to the importance of the subject consistency between the premise and the hypothesis in determining entailment.
2. The subtle differences in the belief/understanding of different individuals need to be further highlighted.
3. A more explicit elaboration on the impact of complexity and nesting of thoughts, beliefs, or assumptions would likely be beneficial.
4. Reiterate that even if the premise and the hypothesis contain similar ideas or events, changing their positioning or context may not directly imply the truth of the hypothesis.
5. Finally, it might be helpful to provide sample examples for what makes an 'entailment' versus a 'non-entailment' to guide the model's understanding.

<1> 
Question: The input prompt poses a premise and a hypothesis. The premise states Robert suspects that Emma believes they see a particular situation occurring (five people kneeling between two parked cars with a man approaching with a raised arm). The hypothesis mirrors the presumed visual situation but says it is Robert who suspects it, excluding Emma and her belief.

The model responds inaccurately in favor of entailment (A), meaning the premise leads directly to the hypothesis, which is incorrect in this case.

Analysis of Wrong Answer: 

1. The model might not fully understand the nuance of the task that entails thorough evaluation of relationships, given that the situation in both premise and hypothesis is the same (the scene of five people between two parked cars) but involves different subjects (Emma versus Robert).

2. The model does not properly consider the entire prompt instruction about potentially misreading situations where the subjects (Emma versus Robert) differ, which should typically indicate non-entailment.

<2> 
Question: The given task mirrors the previous one, this time depicting a premise where Robert suspects Thomas understands a situation regarding a sports event. The hypothesis mirrors the sports situation but states Thomas understands it, excluding Robert and his suspicion.

Analyzing in favor of entailment (A) again, the model seems to believe that the premise leads directly to the hypothesis, which is wrong.

Analysis of Wrong Answer: 

1. The model does not seem to grasp the complexities of the task and analyze relationships aggressively, taking into account critical differences. The scenario in both the premise and hypothesis is the same (a baseball player preparing to catch a ball) but concerning different subjects (Thomas versus Robert).

2. The instruction about caution when subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ as usually indicating 'non-entailment' again appears to be overlooked by the model.

Improvements:

1. Modify the explanation to be more explicit about the significance of subjects' roles in premises and hypotheses. Emphasize that if the subject(s) changes between the premise and the hypothesis, this usually results in non-entailment.

2. Specify the limits of belief, suspicion, or perception. Encourage the model to consider that believed or suspected thoughts about another person's understanding do not make those assumptions trustworthy or factual.

3. Explain more clearly what is meant by 'direct conclusion' in the definition of entailment, stressing that it involves an indisputable logical connection between a premise and a hypothesis. The relationship should not rely merely on superficial similarities.

4. Possibly simplify the initial explanation to avoid confusion while still covering the necessary aspects.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the details within each premise and hypothesis, and determine the causal relationship between them. Choose from the options 'entailment', if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', if the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise. Pay particularly close attention to nuanced details and abstract concepts that may influence the relationship. Present your answer as one of the two options at the end, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to identify the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, by choosing 'entailment' if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, and 'non-entailment' if it does not directly follow. It is crucial to understand that the perception, belief, assumption, or suspicion of a person about another person's recognition or thoughts may not necessarily imply the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. If the subject of the premise and the subject of the hypothesis are different, this could be a clue that the relationship is not entailment. Always review nuanced details and abstract concepts affecting the relationship. Once you finish your analysis, present your choice as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', bracketed elaborately between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' is when the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion from the premise. Consider that a person’s perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about what another person thinks or recognizes does not certainly affirm those thoughts or recognitions as true. Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ, as it might be an indicator of 'non-entailment'. When analyzing, pay attention to subtle factors and abstract ideas that may influence the relationship. Present your analysis result as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and insert it between <answer> and </answer>. Note: one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation.

<START> Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The category 'entailment' should be selected when the premise leads indisputably, without any reliance on assumptions or perceptions, to the hypothesis. The category 'non-entailment' should be selected when there is not a clear and direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, pay attention to changing subjects, perceived events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. These factors usually indicate a 'non-entailment' situation, as the hypothesis does not directly arise from the premise. When the subject changed between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event or the situation remained the same, this is a strong indicator of a 'non-entailment'.

gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the model seems to be misapplying the instruction about considering a person’s beliefs or assumptions about what another person thinks or recognizes. In the premise, "Isabella assumes that Michael sees two female martial artists demonstrate a kick in front of an audience", the element of Michael's perception is not carried over into the hypothesis. Since it is just about what Isabella is assuming and the hypothesis is exactly what she's assuming, it should be an 'entailment'. However, the model was perhaps thrown off by the caution note about believing or thinking about another situation does not necessarily validate that situation, hence it predicted as 'non-entailment'

<2> 
In the second example, the model incorrectly classified the relationship as 'entailment'. The premise was "Michael suspects that Emma believes that two cars are being driven in a car race," but the hypothesis was simply, "Emma believes that two cars are being driven in a car race." The hypothesis here does not entail that Michael suspects anything, which seems to be a case of 'non-entailment'. However, the model perhaps didn't understand the layering of perspectives well enough and didn't differentiate between what Michael supposes and what Emma believes.

<3>
In the third example, the model again appears to misinterpret the directive pertaining to a person's beliefs or thoughts about another person's situation. The premise and the hypothesis look pretty similar, "Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction," and "Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction." Here, the element of Charles learning is not carried forward into the hypothesis, making it a 'non-entailment', but the overall situation is a thought Michael has. The model seems to be confused by such multiple layers of perspectives and the variable who is doing what that leads to the wrong prediction.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Provide a clearer definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', with robust examples covering various scenarios, including those with multiple layers of inferred information.
2. When managing subjective views, beliefs, or assumptions, explain how exactly to handle these scenarios. 
3. Emphasize the importance of comparing who the subjects are and what actions or states they are associated with in the premise and hypothesis.
4. Define that the existence of an extra layer of perception or belief does not guarantee 'non-entailment', but rather should be compared in conjunction with the overall situation described. 
5. More guidelines and examples regarding the abstraction of key information from the premise and hypothesis to make accurate judgments.

However, the model was perhaps thrown off by the caution note about believing or thinking about another situation does not necessarily validate that situation, hence it predicted as 'non-entailment'

<2> 
In the second example, the model incorrectly classified the relationship as 'entailment'. The premise was "Michael suspects that Emma believes that two cars are being driven in a car race," but the hypothesis was simply, "Emma believes that two cars are being driven in a car race." The hypothesis here does not entail that Michael suspects anything, which seems to be a case of 'non-entailment'. However, the model perhaps didn't understand the layering of perspectives well enough and didn't differentiate between what Michael supposes and what Emma believes.

<3>
In the third example, the model again appears to misinterpret the directive pertaining to a person's beliefs or thoughts about another person's situation. The premise and the hypothesis look pretty similar, "Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction," and "Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction." Here, the element of Charles learning is not carried forward into the hypothesis, making it a 'non-entailment', but the overall situation is a thought Michael has. The model seems to be confused by such multiple layers of perspectives and the variable who is doing what that leads to the wrong prediction.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Provide a clearer definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', with robust examples covering various scenarios, including those with multiple layers of inferred information.
2. When managing subjective views, beliefs, or assumptions, explain how exactly to handle these scenarios. 
3. Emphasize the importance of comparing who the subjects are and what actions or states they are associated with in the premise and hypothesis.
4. Define that the existence of an extra layer of perception or belief does not guarantee 'non-entailment', but rather should be compared in conjunction with the overall situation described. 
5. More guidelines and examples regarding the abstraction of key information from the premise and hypothesis to make accurate judgments.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the details within each premise and hypothesis, and determine the causal relationship between them. Choose from the options 'entailment', if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', if the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise. Pay particularly close attention to nuanced details and abstract concepts that may influence the relationship. Present your answer as one of the two options at the end, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to identify the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, by choosing 'entailment' if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, and 'non-entailment' if it does not directly follow. It is crucial to understand that the perception, belief, assumption, or suspicion of a person about another person's recognition or thoughts may not necessarily imply the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. If the subject of the premise and the subject of the hypothesis are different, this could be a clue that the relationship is not entailment. Always review nuanced details and abstract concepts affecting the relationship. Once you finish your analysis, present your choice as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', bracketed elaborately between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' is when the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion from the premise. Consider that a person’s perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about what another person thinks or recognizes does not certainly affirm those thoughts or recognitions as true. Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ, as it might be an indicator of 'non-entailment'. When analyzing, pay attention to subtle factors and abstract ideas that may influence the relationship. Present your analysis result as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and insert it between <answer> and </answer>. Note: one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation.

<START>
Your task is to analyze the correlation between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' was conceptualized as when the premise unambiguously gives rise to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis cannot be explicitly deduced from the premise. It’s crucial to remember that a person's perspective, belief, suspicion, or hypothesis about what another individual perceives or includes in their cognitive processes does not automatically legitimise those thoughts or recognitions as fact. This means that just because person A believes or suspects that person B is thinking or perceiving something, it does not determine the hypothesis as 'entailment' unless the hypothesis directly entails the same. When the subjects in the premise and hypothesis diverge, this may suggest a 'non-entailment', but it’s not universally true. The categorization depends on whether the core circumstances described in the hypothesis are a direct result of the premise. Therefore, carefully root out subtle elements, layered perceptions, or abstract ideas that can sway the connection. After your analysis, present your conclusion as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and put it between <answer> and </answer> to show your final judgment. Remember, the accuracy of a person’s belief about another person’s situation doesn’t necessarily authenticate that situation.

1) Examination of Wrong Answer:

Prompt:
Premise: Sophia assumes that James understands that the man in white is playing basketball against the man in blue. 
Hypothesis: Sophia assumes that the man in white is playing basketball against the man in blue.

Output: (B) non-entailment 

Correct: (A) entailment

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
a) The prompt cautions the model about determining the entailment based on one person's beliefs or assumptions about another person's thoughts or recognitions. This could lead to confusion when a person's assumption itself is the premise and hypothesis. The model might be confused as it's Sophia's assumption in both premise and hypothesis.
b) The note added in the prompt stating "one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation." might have lead the model towards 'non-entailment' as Sophia's assumption about James doesn't validate actual situation.
c) The sentence "Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ," might be misinterpreted by the model. The subjects here are the same, but the confusion might arise from James not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis.

Improvement of the Prompt:

1) Clarify the Role of Assumptions: The instructions should clearly specify how to treat assumptions when they form the premise and hypothesis itself. The current instructions make it seem like these should not be considered as entailment.

2) Clear Instructions About Subjects: The instructions should explicitly state that the subjects being considered for differentiation should be the ones carrying out the main action or central to the hypothesis or premise. This will avoid confusion when secondary entities like James in this case are not mentioned in both cases.

3) Caution on Validate Interpersonal Thoughts: Carefully rephrase the note on validation that could be misinterpreted. Focus more on defining 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' with examples where someone's thoughts about another's situation is present.

4) Layered Cases: For complex cases like this where assumptions of a person are being considered for another person, guidelines can be added to interpret such cases by distinguishing the layers and treating them separately. 

5) Examples & Non-examples: Give the model clear examples and non-examples of both entailments and non-entailments, so it has a better idea of what each one looks like. This will provide a better frame of reference. This could include both direct and nuanced instances. 

6) Temporal Order: If applicable, prompt might also instruct to consider the temporal order of the events. Sometimes, when the hypothesis indicates a result that happens after the situation in the premise, the entailment is clearer. 

7) Clarity on Perception, Belief, Assumption and Facts: Draw clear distinction or give guidelines on how to treat someone's perception, belief or assumption against hard facts while determining the entailment or non-entailment.

Premise: David believes that Isabella believes that a man wearing a white shirt and a hat, riding his bike, makes an obscene gesture to the photographer. 

Hypothesis: David believes that a man wearing a white shirt and a hat, riding his bike, makes an obscene gesture to the photographer.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Correct Answer:  <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Analysis: The introduction to the task in the prompt is quite comprehensive; however, it appears that the key term "change of subject" might have been misunderstood by the model, leading to this incorrect categorization. In the premise, the subject ultimately is Isabella's belief; in the hypothesis, the belief of Isabella is no longer present. This changes the core subject from what Isabella believes to what David himself believes. This change in subject should indicate a non-entailment situation. However, due to the similarity of content (man in white shirt, bike, obscene gesture), the model may incorrectly perceive the two statements as being directly linked.

Improvement: 

1. Clarify what "change of subject" entails: Specify in the prompts that changing subjects includes changes in the person whose perceptions or beliefs are being presented. 

2. Add examples: Incorporate a few examples into the prompt to demonstrate correct classifications of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. By referencing these examples, the model may be better able to understand the concepts and perform the task.

3. State the exception: Highlight in the prompt that even if two scenarios sound very similar, they can still fall into the 'non-entailment' category if the subject or the person whose beliefs, events or perceptions are being considered changes.

4. Highlight Indirect Connection: Emphasize that if the premise indirectly suggests the hypothesis through a third party person's view (like Isabella in this case), it's a 'non-entailment' scenario.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The category 'entailment' should be selected when the premise leads indisputably, without any reliance on assumptions or perceptions, to the hypothesis. The category 'non-entailment' should be selected when there is not a clear and direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, pay attention to changing subjects, perceived events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. These factors usually indicate a 'non-entailment' situation, as the hypothesis does not directly arise from the premise. When the subject changed between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event or the situation remained the same, this is a strong indicator of a 'non-entailment'. Finally, present your conclusion by inserting the word 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, even strong beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not necessarily mean it's a fact or it's happening.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the details within each premise and hypothesis, and determine the causal relationship between them. Choose from the options 'entailment', if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', if the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise. Pay particularly close attention to nuanced details and abstract concepts that may influence the relationship. Present your answer as one of the two options at the end, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to identify the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, by choosing 'entailment' if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, and 'non-entailment' if it does not directly follow. It is crucial to understand that the perception, belief, assumption, or suspicion of a person about another person's recognition or thoughts may not necessarily imply the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. If the subject of the premise and the subject of the hypothesis are different, this could be a clue that the relationship is not entailment. Always review nuanced details and abstract concepts affecting the relationship. Once you finish your analysis, present your choice as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', bracketed elaborately between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' is when the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion from the premise. Consider that a person’s perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about what another person thinks or recognizes does not certainly affirm those thoughts or recognitions as true. Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ, as it might be an indicator of 'non-entailment'. When analyzing, pay attention to subtle factors and abstract ideas that may influence the relationship. Present your analysis result as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and insert it between <answer> and </answer>. Note: one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation.
(4) Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The category 'entailment' should be selected when the premise leads indisputably, without any reliance on assumptions or perceptions, to the hypothesis. The category 'non-entailment' should be selected when there is not a clear and direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, pay attention to changing subjects, perceived events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. These factors usually indicate a 'non-entailment' situation, as the hypothesis does not directly arise from the premise. When the subject changed between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event or the situation remained the same, this is a strong indicator of a 'non-entailment'.

Remember, even strong beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not necessarily mean it's a fact or it's happening.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> You are required to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. This connection should be labeled either as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Choose 'entailment' if the premise indisputably leads to the hypothesis, with no reliance on assumptions or perceptions. Choose 'non-entailment' if there isn't a clear, logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. In particular, watch out for shifts in subjects, or implied events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. Such transformations are typically indicative of a 'non-entailment' scenario due to the fact that the hypothesis doesn't arise directly from the premise. To clarify, even if two scenarios are similar in events or behaviors, it doesn't mean they entail each other. If there's an alteration in whose perceptions, beliefs, or thoughts are considered even though the situation remains the same, it's often 'non-entailment'. The change can be subtle, from one person's belief about another's thoughts to the first person's own belief about the situation. To emphasize, indirect assumption of the hypothesis from the premise via someone else's viewpoint equates to a 'non-entailment'. Finally, indicate your analysis by inserting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Be mindful that even deeply held beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not confirm the factual state of affairs. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For each of the wrong examples, there seems to be a misunderstanding in how the model is interpreting the prompt instruction, particularly in the context of beliefs or thoughts.

<1>:
The model incorrectly interprets the relationship as 'non-entailment'. The premise states that William believes the man is sweeping with a red broom, while the hypothesis is that William believes the man is sweeping dirt. In reality, 'sweeping with a red broom' inherently includes 'sweeping dirt', so this constitutes an 'entailment'. It appears the model is perceiving sweeping with a broom and sweeping dirt as two distinct actions, rather than recognizing that sweeping with a broom inherently involves sweeping dirt. 

<2> and <3>: 
Here, the model fails to distinguish between the premise that one person suspects or believes that another person believes something, and the hypothesis that the second person actually believes that thing. This error may result from the model's misunderstanding of the concept of 'belief'. In both cases, it treats the premise that Joseph suspects John believes something, and Emma believes Richard understands something, as equivalent to the hypothesis that John believes that thing or Richard understands that thing respectively.

Improvement Suggestions based on these observations:

1. Enhance the explanation of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt to better differentiate between the two. 
2. Clearly stipulate that if the premise involves someone's belief about another person's belief, thought, or understanding, the hypothesis that the second person holds such belief, thought, or understanding is not a direct entailment. 
3. Further clarify concerning what constitutes a direct logical connection between a premise and a hypothesis. Use concrete examples, if necessary, to explain complex idea. 
4. Make clear that for an 'entailment' to hold, it is not enough for the premise and the hypothesis to be about similar or overlapping situations or events. The premise has to indisputably lead to the conclusion without any assumptions or interpretations to help the model make correct judgements.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the details within each premise and hypothesis, and determine the causal relationship between them. Choose from the options 'entailment', if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', if the hypothesis does not directly follow from the premise. Pay particularly close attention to nuanced details and abstract concepts that may influence the relationship. Present your answer as one of the two options at the end, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Your task is to identify the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, by choosing 'entailment' if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, and 'non-entailment' if it does not directly follow. It is crucial to understand that the perception, belief, assumption, or suspicion of a person about another person's recognition or thoughts may not necessarily imply the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. If the subject of the premise and the subject of the hypothesis are different, this could be a clue that the relationship is not entailment. Always review nuanced details and abstract concepts affecting the relationship. Once you finish your analysis, present your choice as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', bracketed elaborately between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' is when the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion from the premise. Consider that a person’s perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about what another person thinks or recognizes does not certainly affirm those thoughts or recognitions as true. Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ, as it might be an indicator of 'non-entailment'. When analyzing, pay attention to subtle factors and abstract ideas that may influence the relationship. Present your analysis result as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and insert it between <answer> and </answer>. Note: one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation.
(4) Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The category 'entailment' should be selected when the premise leads indisputably, without any reliance on assumptions or perceptions, to the hypothesis. The category 'non-entailment' should be selected when there is not a clear and direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, pay attention to changing subjects, perceived events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. These factors usually indicate a 'non-entailment' situation, as the hypothesis does not directly arise from the premise. When the subject changed between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event or the situation remained the same, this is a strong indicator of a 'non-entailment'. Finally, present your conclusion by inserting the word 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, even strong beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not necessarily mean it's a fact or it's happening.

Premise: Olivia assumes that Taylor learns that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. Hypothesis: Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Joseph believes that Emma assumes that a man in a black t-shirt and jeans is standing on the sidewalk looking at the camera as people walk by. Hypothesis: Emma assumes that a man in a black t-shirt and jeans is standing on the sidewalk looking at the camera as people walk by.

The model responded with 'entailment', while the correct response should have been 'non-entailment'. The potential issue here is that the model omits the important distinction between someone's belief about another person's assumption (in this case, Joseph's belief about Emma's assumption) and the direct assumption of the individual involved (Emma's assumption). The belief of one person about another's assumption is not equivalent to the other person's actual assumption. Thus, even if the premises and hypotheses share the same factual content, the change in perspective invalidates entailment. This nuance seems to be beyond the model's current understanding as the prompt does not sufficiently emphasize the difference.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Olivia assumes that Taylor learns that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. Hypothesis: Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake.

The model responded with 'non-entailment', while the correct response should have been 'entailment'. In this case, the model might have taken the prompt's cautionary notes about changing subjects and perceptions too far. Rather than discerning that Taylor's knowledge does not play a part in Olivia's assumption about the situation, the model perceives the shift in context from Taylor's learning to Olivia's assumption as a significant change. The original prompt perhaps needs to clarify that the presence of third-party perspectives does not automatically disqualify an entailment situation.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Highlight the importance of perspective and subjective understanding. Emphasize the significance of the belief of one person about another's assumption, and how it is different from the direct assumption of the individual involved.
   
2. Clarify that the presence of third-party perspectives or changes in the subject does not automatically lead to non-entailment. There can still be entailment if the main proposition itself does not change, despite the subject changing. 

3. Include explicit examples along with explanations to better train the model. Real examples that demonstrate when entailment can still exist, despite changing subjects, can provide clearer guidance to the model.

4. Promote critical assessment of context. Task-dependent, nuanced distinctions such as the difference between a belief about someone's perception and the perception itself are crucial. The prompt should explicitly ask for these to be considered and discriminated when necessary.

<START> Your task is to critically evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Specifically, categorize the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The categorization 'entailment' describes relationships where the hypothesis is directly, indisputably derived from the premise. 'Non-entailment', on the other hand, is used when the premise does not provide a clear, direct logical foundation for the hypothesis. In doing so, be particularly cognizant of variations in subjects, beliefs about another person's thoughts, or perceived events. When the subject changes between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event remains the same, this often signals a 'non-entailment'. Similarly, if the premise involves someone's beliefs or assumptions about another's thoughts or actions, this does not necessarily imply 'entailment'. One person's belief about another's thoughts does not confer objective reality to those thoughts. Remember, the presence of third-party perspectives, or a subject's thoughts and perceptions, doesn't automatically lead to 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Analyze the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, keeping all sentence aspects in consideration. Examine the context, logical coherence, and the origin of beliefs or assumptions. Pay special attention to words that suggest certainty or uncertainty such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Specifically, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief or assumption about them. Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes that something'. Indicator words like 'thinks' and 'believes' used by secondary characters should not be taken as a direct assertion of belief. Nested sentences should be analyzed one by one, taking into consideration the attribution of each belief or assumption. With these detailed evaluations, assess if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and make a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should not only involve the described actions in the hypothesis and premise but also consider the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed.

   prompt: Carry out a detailed analysis of the given premise and hypothesis, focusing on every aspect of the sentences. Examine the overall context, consistency in logic, and the sources of beliefs or assumptions. Pay close attention to words that convey certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Identify whether there is a change in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Importantly, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributable to a character or indirectly inferred through another character's belief or assumption about them. A crucial clarification here is that 'X believes that Y believes something' does not automatically imply 'Y believes that something'. Moreover, terms such as 'thinks' and 'believes' employed by secondary characters should not be interpreted as a direct declaration of belief by the primary characters. An analysis of nested sentences should be conducted one by one, focusing on the attribution of each belief or assumption, particularly tackling the complexities of nested assumptions. A shift in the attribution of beliefs from one character to another implies a difference rather than a continuation of belief. Based on this thorough examination, evaluate whether the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, culminating in a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should comprise not only the actions detailed in the hypothesis and premise but also the given context, the attributes of each belief, and how beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed.

   prompt: Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, focusing primarily on understanding the origin, attribution, and evolution of thoughts or beliefs. Analyze the subjects of these thoughts or beliefs, i.e., who holds these thoughts or beliefs and their content. Note words such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks', and identify the subjects associated with these verbs. Determine if there is any change in the subject, the thought, and the object of these thoughts between the premise and hypothesis. Keep in mind that a shift in the origin of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another may lead to 'non-entailment', but doesn't imply so in all cases. 

Evaluate if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, considering both specific and generalized aspects, context, logical consistency, semantic relationships, and actions or thoughts. Remember, the hypothesis need not duplicate the premise exactly. It can also be a simplified, generalized, or semantically equivalent form that adheres to the premise's constraints. 

Check if the degree of specificity in hypothesis is compatible with the premise. Generalized statement in the hypothesis is accepted as entailment if it respects the premise's details. 

'Non-entailment' is not just about shifts in thought or beliefs; it should be selected when the hypothesis presents or assumes information not affirmed or allowed by the premise. 

Make sure your evaluation takes into account the context, attributes, the degree of specificity, semantic relationships, and changes in belief attribution, alongside the actions and beliefs portrayed in both the hypothesis and premise. Finally, based on your detailed evaluation, make a choice between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', enclosing your selection in <answer> and </answer> tags at the end.

   prompt: Your task is to meticulously analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Ensure you contemplate all potential inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise holds value and must be logically weighed against the hypothesis. Be cautious that an identical subject in the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The assumptions in the premise may not always have a direct correspondence with the hypothesis. Always consider the exact roles entities play in both sentences and check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis. Pay close attention to whether the premise and the hypothesis maintain a logical and sequential consistency in their events or facts. Place yourself in different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief' for a more nuanced understanding of the information conveyed. As you deliberate, keep in mind the context, and verify that your conclusion is logically consistent. The ideal conclusion is a result of an in-depth exploration of the interconnectedness between the premise and the hypothesis, where the order of operations and the linearity of scenarios are adequately considered.

   prompt: Your task is to rigorously examine the premise and hypothesis provided. Pay due attention to every detail encapsulated in the sentences, including minor yet consequential factors such as the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs), the roles of entities, and the source or origin of the belief or action. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to express this relationship. Do not take for granted that similar subjects or identical phrases in the premise and hypothesis imply entailment. Ensure you verify all potential deductions from the premise. Evaluate each element in the premise in its logical relation to the hypothesis. Be mindful that the assumptions implied in the premise may not apply directly to the hypothesis. Pay special attention to the subject of actions, beliefs, or suspicions, and check the consistency of the roles these subjects play in the premise and hypothesis. Analyze whether the sequence of events or facts maintains logical consistency in the transition from premise to hypothesis. Take on various perspectives such as 'suspicion', 'fact', or 'belief' to gain a more nuanced understanding. As you deliberate, bear in mind the overarching context and guarantee that your conclusion is logically consistent. Remember, the optimal conclusion is derived from a comprehensive review of the interrelation between premise and hypothesis, where factors like the source of information, the order of operations, and the flow of scenarios are taken into account. Once you've determined the relationship, state your answer between <answer> and </answer>.

Your objective is to confirm if the hypothesis is a logical outcome of the premise by choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Be sure to consider all possible inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise is important and must be logically compared or contrasted with the hypothesis. Please remember, the identicality of the subject in the premise and hypothesis doesn't necessarily imply entailment. Also, the assumption in the premise may not always directly apply to the hypothesis. Understand the context and ensure there is logical consistency in your conclusion. Your answer must be an outcome of a detailed examination of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Finally, your response should be placed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to meticulously analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Ensure you contemplate all potential inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise holds value and must be logically weighed against the hypothesis. Be cautious that an identical subject in the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The assumptions in the premise may not always have a direct correspondence with the hypothesis. Always consider the exact roles entities play in both sentences and check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis. Pay close attention to whether the premise and the hypothesis maintain a logical and sequential consistency in their events or facts. Place yourself in different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief' for a more nuanced understanding of the information conveyed. As you deliberate, keep in mind the context, and verify that your conclusion is logically consistent. The ideal conclusion is a result of an in-depth exploration of the interconnectedness between the premise and the hypothesis, where the order of operations and the linearity of scenarios are adequately considered. Wrap your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to rigorously examine the premise and hypothesis provided. Pay due attention to every detail encapsulated in the sentences, including minor yet consequential factors such as the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs), the roles of entities, and the source or origin of the belief or action. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to express this relationship. Do not take for granted that similar subjects or identical phrases in the premise and hypothesis imply entailment. Ensure you verify all potential deductions from the premise. Evaluate each element in the premise in its logical relation to the hypothesis. Be mindful that the assumptions implied in the premise may not apply directly to the hypothesis. Pay special attention to the subject of actions, beliefs, or suspicions, and check the consistency of the roles these subjects play in the premise and hypothesis. Analyze whether the sequence of events or facts maintains logical consistency in the transition from premise to hypothesis. Take on various perspectives such as 'suspicion', 'fact', or 'belief' to gain a more nuanced understanding. As you deliberate, bear in mind the overarching context and guarantee that your conclusion is logically consistent. Remember, the optimal conclusion is derived from a comprehensive review of the interrelation between premise and hypothesis, where factors like the source of information, the order of operations, and the flow of scenarios are taken into account. Once you've determined the relationship, state your answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, by choosing 'entailment' if the hypothesis is directly implied by the premise, and 'non-entailment' if it does not directly follow. It is crucial to understand that the perception, belief, assumption, or suspicion of a person about another person's recognition or thoughts may not necessarily imply the truth of those thoughts or recognitions. If the subject of the premise and the subject of the hypothesis are different, this could be a clue that the relationship is not entailment.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' is when the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion from the premise. Consider that a person’s perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about what another person thinks or recognizes does not certainly affirm those thoughts or recognitions as true. Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ, as it might be an indicator of 'non-entailment'. When analyzing, pay attention to subtle factors and abstract ideas that may influence the relationship. Present your analysis result as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and insert it between <answer> and </answer>. Note: one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The category 'entailment' should be selected when the premise leads indisputably, without any reliance on assumptions or perceptions, to the hypothesis. The category 'non-entailment' should be selected when there is not a clear and direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, pay attention to changing subjects, perceived events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. These factors usually indicate a 'non-entailment' situation, as the hypothesis does not directly arise from the premise. When the subject changed between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event or the situation remained the same, this is a strong indicator of a 'non-entailment'. Finally, present your conclusion by inserting the word 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, even strong beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not necessarily mean it's a fact or it's happening.

   prompt: Your task is to examine the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Choose 'entailment' when the premise indisputably and directly leads to the hypothesis without any additional assumptions or interpretations. Choose 'non-entailment' when there is not a clear and immediate logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Be mindful of the instances where a person’s belief or perception about another person's thoughts or actions is presented, these do not necessarily affirm those thoughts or actions as accurate or real. Moreover, if the subject itself changed between the premise and the hypothesis regardless of the situation stayed the same, usually the relationship is 'non-entailment'. Also, even if the premise and the hypothesis are about similar events or situations, do not assume 'entailment' unless the premise inevitably leads to the hypothesis. Ensure you carefully consider every detail and avoid making quick assumptions while determining the relationship. Once you have determined the relationship, present your answer by inserting the word 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, someone's strong belief or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily make it factual or happening. Base your process strictly on logic, not on assumption or supposition.

   prompt: Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis attentively, bearing in mind not just the specific details but also the overall meaning conveyed by both the sentences. Determine if the hypothesis logically aligns with the core idea of the premise, whilst recognizing that not all details from the premise need to be included in the hypothesis for the concept of 'entailment' to hold true. Be flexible in your analysis and assess which details are central to the premise and which are secondary or peripheral. Carefully weigh the impact of each detail on the overall understanding of the premise and decide if its presence or absence in the hypothesis materially affects the meaning. Also, consider the overall context and use logical reasoning to derive inferences from the premise and speculate if they align with the hypothesis. After your thorough evaluation, choose 'entailment' if the hypothesis adequately reflects the essential meaning and context of the premise even if some minor details are omitted, or choose 'non-entailment' if the key ideas in the premise do not align with the hypothesis.

   prompt: Analyze the premise and hypothesis thoroughly, keeping all sentence aspects in consideration. Examine the context, logical coherence, and the origin of beliefs or assumptions. Pay special attention to words that suggest certainty or uncertainty such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether there is a shift in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Specifically, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributed to a character or indirectly implied through another character's belief or assumption about them. Do not automatically assume that 'X believes that Y believes something' implies 'Y believes that something'. Indicator words like 'thinks' and 'believes' used by secondary characters should not be taken as a direct assertion of belief. Nested sentences should be analyzed one by one, taking into consideration the attribution of each belief or assumption. With these detailed evaluations, assess if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, and make a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should not only involve the described actions in the hypothesis and premise but also consider the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed.

   prompt: Conduct a thorough analysis of the given premise and hypothesis, taking note of every facet of the sentences. Be mindful of the overall context, the logic connecting different parts of the sentences, and the origin of beliefs or thoughts. Zero in on words that introduce a sense of certainty or uncertainty, like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. 

Determine if there's a shift in the attribution of thoughts or beliefs from the premise to hypothesis, and whether the hypothesis accurately and completely reflects the premise's attributions. If the premise includes attributed beliefs, remember that the belief or thought held by one person about another's thoughts or beliefs is not definitive proof that the second person holds that belief or thought. This must be specifically stated in the hypothesis to draw a direct line of entailment.

Judge if the hypothesis logically follows the premise by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The result should not only mirror the activities described in the hypothesis and premise but also lay great emphasis on context, attributes, and how beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed.

Ensure all agents or subjects in the premise and hypothesis are matched carefully. If the premise and hypothesis include the same actions but do not share the same topic or subject, this should be factored into the choice between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

Lastly, frame your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> for clarity. Do not merely mention your answer category, but provide it in this format: <answer>your chosen option</answer>.

   prompt: Evaluate carefully the given premise and hypothesis, placing strong emphasis on understanding the source and attribution of beliefs or thoughts. Observe the subjects of beliefs or thoughts—i.e., who holds these beliefs or thoughts, and what they are about. Pay special attention to words like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks' and the subjects associated with these verbs. Assess if there is any change in the subject, the belief, and the object of these beliefs between the premise and hypothesis. Any shift in the source of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another often leads to 'non-entailment'. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows the premise after considering the context, logical consistency, and the entities' actions and thoughts. Ensure that your evaluation not only reflects the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, but also thoroughly considers the context, attributes, and changes in belief attribution. Finally, based on your comprehensive evaluation, choose between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', bracketing your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the premise and hypothesis, keeping the overall context and structural elements in consideration. Pay attention to all aspects of the sentences but remember not to overanalyze individual details that do not alter the core information. While examining, consider the logical coherence, but ensure not to get lost in minor details or narrative style discrepancies. Highlight the presence of words that indicate beliefs or assumptions like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Although these words are absolute in their claims, understand that they may not always represent a direct assertion of belief by the characters. Assess if there's any shift in the attribution of beliefs from the premise to the hypothesis, but refrain from overscrutinizing the minor changes. Evaluate the hypothesis in the context of the premise, considering if the hypothesis is the logical continuation of the given premise. This evaluation should focus on the core information in the hypothesis and if it is covered in the premise, not necessarily requiring every detail of the premise to be present in the hypothesis. Based on your comprehensive analysis, decide if the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Your options are 'entailment' if the hypothesis logically follows the premise (even if the premise has additional details) or 'non-entailment' if there is information in the hypothesis not covered in the premise or if the hypothesis contradicts the premise. Highlight the chosen response by enclosing it between <answer> and </answer> tags at the end of your analysis. Your answer should reflect a balanced attention to the entire composition of the premise and hypothesis, without overlooking the broader narrative structure for minor details.

   prompt: Conduct a detailed analysis of the given premise and hypothesis, scrutinizing each aspect of the sentences provided. Delve into the context and logical coherence while trying to understand the source of beliefs or assumptions. Pay careful attention to words that indicate a degree of certainty or uncertainty, like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Examine if there's a shift in marking the source of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. In particular, establish whether the belief is directly assigned to a character or subtly signified through another character's belief or presumption about them. Be aware that someone asserting 'X believes that Y believes something' doesn't always mean 'Y actually believes that something'. 'Thinks' or 'believes' used by secondary characters aren't always a direct assertion of belief. However, note that the assertion 'X recognizes that Y believes something' does imply 'Y believes something', since recognition signifies a more concrete form of belief attribution. Consequently, the context is crucial in deciphering the correct interpretation. Examine each nested sentence individually, considering the source of each belief or assumption. Following a thorough investigation, evaluate if the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, then choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Again, the examination should not only engage with the actions detailed in both the hypothesis and premise but also contemplate the context, the attributes, and the way beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are conveyed. Finally, enclose your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> at the conclusion of your response.

   prompt: Carry out a detailed analysis of the given premise and hypothesis, focusing on every aspect of the sentences. Examine the overall context, consistency in logic, and the sources of beliefs or assumptions. Pay close attention to words that convey certainty or uncertainty like 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks'. Identify whether there is a change in the attribution of beliefs and thoughts from the premise to the hypothesis. Importantly, evaluate whether the belief is directly attributable to a character or indirectly inferred through another character's belief or assumption about them. A crucial clarification here is that 'X believes that Y believes something' does not automatically imply 'Y believes that something'. Moreover, terms such as 'thinks' and 'believes' employed by secondary characters should not be interpreted as a direct declaration of belief by the primary characters. An analysis of nested sentences should be conducted one by one, focusing on the attribution of each belief or assumption, particularly tackling the complexities of nested assumptions. A shift in the attribution of beliefs from one character to another implies a difference rather than a continuation of belief. Based on this thorough examination, evaluate whether the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, culminating in a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your evaluation should comprise not only the actions detailed in the hypothesis and premise but also the given context, the attributes of each belief, and how beliefs, suspicions, or thoughts are expressed. Lastly, mark your chosen response using the tags <answer> and </answer> following your response.

   prompt: Evaluate the premise and hypothesis thoroughly. Consider the source, subject, and object of beliefs or thoughts—often indicated by verbs like 'suspects', 'believes', 'thinks'—and analyze their role in each statement. Check if there are any changes in these components between the premise and the hypothesis. Remember, a shift in the subject who holds the belief or thought often leads to 'non-entailment', but it isn't so when the shift signifies a nested belief or an understanding of a subset of the original belief. Treat every part of the sentences as valuable information and connect or disconnect them logically with each other to determine the relationship. Make sure your evaluation reflects the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, as well as thoroughly considers the context, attributes, and any changes in belief attribution. After careful examination, decide if the hypothesis logically follows the premise in light of the context, logical consistency, and the entities' actions and thoughts, concluding with 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your chosen answer option should be placed between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

   prompt: Carefully evaluate the given premise and hypothesis, focusing primarily on understanding the origin, attribution, and evolution of thoughts or beliefs. Analyze the subjects of these thoughts or beliefs, i.e., who holds these thoughts or beliefs and their content. Note words such as 'suspects', 'believes', and 'thinks', and identify the subjects associated with these verbs. Determine if there is any change in the subject, the thought, and the object of these thoughts between the premise and hypothesis. Keep in mind that a shift in the origin of these beliefs or thoughts from one character to another may lead to 'non-entailment', but doesn't imply so in all cases. 

Evaluate if the hypothesis logically follows the premise, considering both specific and generalized aspects, context, logical consistency, semantic relationships, and actions or thoughts. Remember, the hypothesis need not duplicate the premise exactly. It can also be a simplified, generalized, or semantically equivalent form that adheres to the premise's constraints. 

Check if the degree of specificity in hypothesis is compatible with the premise. Generalized statement in the hypothesis is accepted as entailment if it respects the premise's details. 

'Non-entailment' is not just about shifts in thought or beliefs; it should be selected when the hypothesis presents or assumes information not affirmed or allowed by the premise. 

Make sure your evaluation takes into account the context, attributes, the degree of specificity, semantic relationships, and changes in belief attribution, alongside the actions and beliefs portrayed in both the hypothesis and premise. Finally, based on your detailed evaluation, make a choice between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', enclosing your selection in <answer> and </answer> tags at the end.

   prompt: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis, focusing on the overall message or idea being conveyed. Do not overly emphasize individual changes in the subject, the belief, or the object of these beliefs. Such minor changes do not necessarily mean a 'non-entailment'; rather, they could simply signify a broadening of the perspective or a different way of expressing the same thought. Although attention should be given to the source and the attribution of beliefs or thoughts, it is the retained or altered meaning between the premise and hypothesis that is crucial. Consider words such as 'suspects', 'believes', 'thinks' and the subjects associated with these verbs, but understand these in a fluid context. When assessing, prioritize the overall meaning and logical coherence rather than picking apart individual components. Decide if the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, incorporating considerations of context and action of entities. Your evaluation should reflect the substance of the actions and beliefs described in the hypothesis and premise, considering the attributes and any significant changes in belief attribution. Finally, based on your comprehensive evaluation, select between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', indicating your chosen answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer> at the end.

   prompt: Your mission is to dissect the provided premise and hypothesis. Give careful thought to every detail contained in the sentences. Your goal is to validate whether the hypothesis logically emanates from the premise, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make efforts to thoroughly consider all potential inferences that can be gathered from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise carries significance and must be logically contrasted or compared with the hypothesis. Do not assume entailment merely based on the identity of the subject in both the premise and hypothesis. Moreover, be aware that the premise’s assumption may not always pertain directly to the hypothesis. It is crucial to note that the subject – the character holding a belief or assumption – plays a significant role in the inference. Understand the essence of the context and ensure there is logical coherence in your final decision. Be conscious of different levels of knowledge or belief such as assuming, thinking, suspecting, etc. Your conclusion must be an outcome of a comprehensive scrutiny of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, considering the context, implicit inferences, knowledge propagation direction within the premises, and cognitive levels. In cases where beliefs are involved, acknowledge that a change in the belief holder can alter the outcome. Your written response must be enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to meticulously analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Absorb every detail in the sentences given and do not ignore the importance of seemingly minor factors like the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs) and the roles, positions or directions of the relations in the sentences. Your mission is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise. You will indicate this relationship by selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Ensure you contemplate all potential inferences from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise holds value and must be logically weighed against the hypothesis. Be cautious that an identical subject in the premise and hypothesis does not guarantee entailment. The assumptions in the premise may not always have a direct correspondence with the hypothesis. Always consider the exact roles entities play in both sentences and check for their consistency when moving from premise to hypothesis. Pay close attention to whether the premise and the hypothesis maintain a logical and sequential consistency in their events or facts. Place yourself in different perspectives like 'suspicion', 'fact' or 'belief' for a more nuanced understanding of the information conveyed. As you deliberate, keep in mind the context, and verify that your conclusion is logically consistent.

   prompt: Your task is to examine the premise and hypothesis given to you in a detailed manner. Remember, every single detail within the sentences is crucial. Your objective is to ascertain whether the hypothesis follows logically from the premise, choosing 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to take into account all potential inferences that can be drawn from the premise. Each piece of information in the premise carries importance and must be logically linked or delinked with the hypothesis based on its relevance. Avoid assuming identical or similar subjects between the premise and hypothesis as an automatic entailment. Also, understand that an assumption present in the premise may not necessarily be applicable in the hypothesis. Consider the order of sentence elements and the perspective or belief of individual subjects as these can drastically affect the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. It's important to comprehend the context and ensure that your conclusion exhibits logical consistency. Keep in mind that contradiction or variations in a person's beliefs or thoughts about others aren't always in line with reality or directly inferable.

   prompt: Your task is to rigorously examine the premise and hypothesis provided. Pay due attention to every detail encapsulated in the sentences, including minor yet consequential factors such as the nature of statements (facts, suspicions, beliefs), the roles of entities, and the source or origin of the belief or action. Determine if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. Choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to express this relationship. Do not take for granted that similar subjects or identical phrases in the premise and hypothesis imply entailment. Ensure you verify all potential deductions from the premise. Evaluate each element in the premise in its logical relation to the hypothesis. Be mindful that the assumptions implied in the premise may not apply directly to the hypothesis. Pay special attention to the subject of actions, beliefs, or suspicions, and check the consistency of the roles these subjects play in the premise and hypothesis. Analyze whether the sequence of events or facts maintains logical consistency in the transition from premise to hypothesis. Take on various perspectives such as 'suspicion', 'fact', or 'belief' to gain a more nuanced understanding. As you deliberate, bear in mind the overarching context and guarantee that your conclusion is logically consistent. Remember, the optimal conclusion is derived from a comprehensive review of the interrelation between premise and hypothesis, where factors like the source of information, the order of operations, and the flow of scenarios are taken into account.

   prompt: Your role revolves around critical examination and understanding of a given premise and its related hypothesis. You are required to delve into the specifics of the information provided - major and minor. Remember, the quality of your analysis rests on the consideration of different aspects of the statements such as: the factual nature, the presence of any suspicions or beliefs, and even the specifics of the syntax in relation to the sentences. With this analysis, make a logical determination as to whether the hypothesis is a valid inference that can be drawn from the premise. The relationship between the two can either be termed as an 'entailment' or a 'non-entailment'. When assessing these possibilities, dig deep into the premise to uncover all potential reflections on the hypothesis. Keep in mind that each fragment of information in the premise is a potential clue that should be contextually matched against the hypothesis. Beware! An identical subject or object in the premise and hypothesis does not necessarily establish entailment. Equally, beliefs or suspicions inferred in the premise don't make them fact in the hypothesis. Consistently account for the exact parts entities take in both statements, ensuring their roles remain constant from premise to hypothesis. Consider the logical and sequential consistency in the events or facts within your premise and hypothesis. Take on diverse perspectives such as viewing statements as a 'fact,' a 'suspicion,' or a 'belief' for comprehensive understanding. In your contemplation, also factor in the greater context, ensuring that your final determination is logical and consistent. Your goal is to reach an optimal conclusion that arises from an exhaustive study of the connectivity between the premise and hypothesis. This includes the chronology of operations and scenarios that have to be logically coherent with the hypothesis. When you have selected from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', enclose your answer between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, you are not just matching subjects or objects but evaluating if the hypothesis is a genuine logical conclusion of the premise based on every word and the specified context.

   prompt: In this task, your goal is to conduct a nuanced analysis of both the given premise and hypothesis. Examine each sentence and every detail therein, understanding the significance of factors like the types of statements - whether they are facts, suspicions, or beliefs. Also, bear in mind the roles, the relative positions, and the directionalities of the relations within these sentences. By analyzing all these factors, you have to arrive at a conclusion about whether the hypothesis is logically derived from the premise. This conclusion will either be 'entailment', suggesting that the truth of the hypothesis is necessarily implied by the premise, or 'non-entailment', indicating the premise doesn't necessarily imply the hypothesis. Ponder over all possible inferences that the premise might suggest. Remember to factor in each piece of data from the premise, weighing it, logically, against the hypothesis. Be watchful not to be swayed by similar subjects in both the premise and the hypothesis, as this doesn't always ensure entailment. Likewise, don't automatically assume non-entailment simply because direct correspondences between the premise and the hypothesis are lacking. It's vital to consider the exact roles that the various entities play in both the premise and the hypothesis, checking their consistency when moving from one to the other. Monitor the premise and hypothesis for a logical sequence and consistency in their events or statements. Adopt varied perspectives such as 'fact', 'suspicion', or 'belief' to gain a more rounded understanding of the conveyed information. Keep the context in mind during your deliberations and verify that your conclusion maintains logical coherence. The most desirable conclusion is a product of a deep dive into the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, considering the order and the linearity of the scenarios.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' is when the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis is not a direct conclusion from the premise. Consider that a person’s perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about what another person thinks or recognizes does not certainly affirm those thoughts or recognitions as true. Be cautious when the subjects in the premise and hypothesis differ, as it might be an indicator of 'non-entailment'. When analyzing, pay attention to subtle factors and abstract ideas that may influence the relationship. Present your analysis result as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and insert it between <answer> and </answer>. Note: one's beliefs or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily validate that situation.

   prompt: The objective is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Distinguish between 'entailment', if the hypothesis is a direct result or consequence of the premise, and 'non-entailment', when the hypothesis has no direct implication from the premise. It's important to realize that the belief, assumption, or perception of one person regarding the thoughts of another person NEVER guarantees the validity of those thoughts. Instead, these are simply interpretations that may or may not correspond to the truth. Also, differences in the subjects in the premise and the hypothesis might denote non-entailment. In simpler terms, the premise is made of two parts: the subject (the person making the assumption) and the belief or perception about reality (the thoughts or occurrence they are interpreting). If these do not align with the hypothesis, it should be classified as 'non-entailment'. As an example, if Peter perceives that Mary thinks that dogs are adorable, it doesn't mean that Mary actually thinks dogs are adorable. Here, 'Peter perceives' is the subject and 'Mary thinks dogs are adorable' is the perceived reality. Although nuanced details and abstract constructs play a critical part in determining the relationship, make sure to pay attention to these details. After you finish your analysis, label your inference as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', neatly contained between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, selecting 'entailment' if the hypothesis is a direct implication of the premise, and 'non-entailment' if it does not directly follow. In your analysis, pay considerable attention to the subject of the statements. If the subject shifts between the premise and the hypothesis, there's a high probability of 'non-entailment'. Note that a person's belief, assumption, or perception about another's thoughts or recognitions do not automatically make the latter true. The complexity and nesting of thoughts, beliefs, or assumptions in the premise versus the hypothesis is also a crucial point of evaluation - a shift in complexity could indicate 'non-entailment'. Relay abstract concepts and nuanced details impacting your decision. In the conclusion, present your decision as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. It might not always be entailment even if the premise and the hypothesis concern the same event or idea but with different contexts or positioning. Think critically and evaluate each word and its position carefully in the hypothesis and premise.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The category 'entailment' should be selected when the premise leads indisputably, without any reliance on assumptions or perceptions, to the hypothesis. The category 'non-entailment' should be selected when there is not a clear and direct logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, pay attention to changing subjects, perceived events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. These factors usually indicate a 'non-entailment' situation, as the hypothesis does not directly arise from the premise. When the subject changed between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event or the situation remained the same, this is a strong indicator of a 'non-entailment'. Finally, present your conclusion by inserting the word 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, even strong beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not necessarily mean it's a fact or it's happening.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the correlation between a premise and a hypothesis and categorize it as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' was conceptualized as when the premise unambiguously gives rise to the hypothesis, while 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis cannot be explicitly deduced from the premise. It’s crucial to remember that a person's perspective, belief, suspicion, or hypothesis about what another individual perceives or includes in their cognitive processes does not automatically legitimise those thoughts or recognitions as fact. This means that just because person A believes or suspects that person B is thinking or perceiving something, it does not determine the hypothesis as 'entailment' unless the hypothesis directly entails the same. When the subjects in the premise and hypothesis diverge, this may suggest a 'non-entailment', but it’s not universally true. The categorization depends on whether the core circumstances described in the hypothesis are a direct result of the premise. Therefore, carefully root out subtle elements, layered perceptions, or abstract ideas that can sway the connection. After your analysis, present your conclusion as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and put it between <answer> and </answer> to show your final judgment. Remember, the accuracy of a person’s belief about another person’s situation doesn’t necessarily authenticate that situation.

   prompt: Your task is to assess the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis by categorizing it as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. An 'entailment' is when the hypothesis directly arises from the premise, while a 'non-entailment' means the hypothesis isn't a direct consequence of the premise. The role of a person's perception, belief, suspicion, or assumption about another's thoughts or recognitions might indicate 'non-entailment' if these influence the validity of the actual situation. However, instances where the assumption or belief itself forms the premise and hypothesis, treat them as equivalent for analysis. When the main subjects performing actions or holding central roles differ in the premise and the hypothesis, this could signal 'non-entailment'. Be diligent in understanding nuanced details and abstract concepts, as these could impact the relationship. The temporal order of events can also provide clues towards entailment or non-entailment. After careful examination, declare your analysis outcome as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and enclose it between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, situations derived purely from one's thoughts or beliefs about another don't necessarily validate the claimed situation unless corroborative factual evidence is presented.

   prompt: You are required to evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. This connection should be labeled either as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Choose 'entailment' if the premise indisputably leads to the hypothesis, with no reliance on assumptions or perceptions. Choose 'non-entailment' if there isn't a clear, logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. In particular, watch out for shifts in subjects, or implied events or beliefs about another person's thoughts. Such transformations are typically indicative of a 'non-entailment' scenario due to the fact that the hypothesis doesn't arise directly from the premise. To clarify, even if two scenarios are similar in events or behaviors, it doesn't mean they entail each other. If there's an alteration in whose perceptions, beliefs, or thoughts are considered even though the situation remains the same, it's often 'non-entailment'. The change can be subtle, from one person's belief about another's thoughts to the first person's own belief about the situation. To emphasize, indirect assumption of the hypothesis from the premise via someone else's viewpoint equates to a 'non-entailment'. Finally, indicate your analysis by inserting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Be mindful that even deeply held beliefs or thoughts about someone else's situation do not confirm the factual state of affairs.

   prompt: Your task is to examine the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Classify this relationship into one of two categories: 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Choose 'entailment' when the premise indisputably and directly leads to the hypothesis without any additional assumptions or interpretations. Choose 'non-entailment' when there is not a clear and immediate logical connection between the premise and hypothesis. Be mindful of the instances where a person’s belief or perception about another person's thoughts or actions is presented, these do not necessarily affirm those thoughts or actions as accurate or real. Moreover, if the subject itself changed between the premise and the hypothesis regardless of the situation stayed the same, usually the relationship is 'non-entailment'. Also, even if the premise and the hypothesis are about similar events or situations, do not assume 'entailment' unless the premise inevitably leads to the hypothesis. Ensure you carefully consider every detail and avoid making quick assumptions while determining the relationship. Once you have determined the relationship, present your answer by inserting the word 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, someone's strong belief or thoughts about another's situation do not necessarily make it factual or happening. Base your process strictly on logic, not on assumption or supposition.

   prompt: Your task is to critically evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Specifically, categorize the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The categorization 'entailment' describes relationships where the hypothesis is directly, indisputably derived from the premise. 'Non-entailment', on the other hand, is used when the premise does not provide a clear, direct logical foundation for the hypothesis. In doing so, be particularly cognizant of variations in subjects, beliefs about another person's thoughts, or perceived events. When the subject changes between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event remains the same, this often signals a 'non-entailment'. Similarly, if the premise involves someone's beliefs or assumptions about another's thoughts or actions, this does not necessarily imply 'entailment'. One person's belief about another's thoughts does not confer objective reality to those thoughts. Remember, the presence of third-party perspectives, or a subject's thoughts and perceptions, doesn't automatically lead to 'non-entailment'. Focus on whether the core proposition in the hypothesis is a direct outcome of the premise, irrespective of the change in the subject. To conclude, insert either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Be mindful that strongly held assumptions or beliefs about someone else's situation are not a guarantee of their actual state or that the condition is factual.
