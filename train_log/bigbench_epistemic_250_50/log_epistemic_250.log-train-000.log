I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma believes that a girl in a hat has some sort of insect on her finger. Hypothesis: Emma believes that the girl is in contact with an insect.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Emma believing that a girl in a hat has an insect on her finger does not necessarily mean she believes the girl is in contact with an insect. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William assumes that Emma sees that a dog with a ball in his mouth running down a road covered in leaves. Hypothesis: Emma sees that a dog with a ball in his mouth running down a road covered in leaves.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first example, the model has incorrectly determined the relation between the premise and hypothesis as non-entailment - it interprets that Emma believing that a girl in a hat has an insect on her finger does not automatically mean she believes the girl is in contact with an insect. However, logically speaking, if there is an insect on someone's finger, that person is in contact with an insect. 

What caused the model to provide a wrong answer is that the initial prompt is regarding causal attribution, which is understanding what factors caused the event or circumstances. However, the question posed is about entailment or logical conclusion which is slightly different from causal attribution. This mismatch between the context set by the prompt and the question may have caused confusion for the language model.

Wrong Example 2:

The initial scenario states that "William assumes," but it doesn't confirm that Emma sees what William is assuming she sees. The model, however, directly relates William's assumption to Emma's sight, which in logical terms is not a necessary entailment.

Again, similar to the first example, the context of the task as set by the prompt is about causal attribution - understanding what causes might lead to certain outcomes. The question about entailment as a logical conclusion doesn't exactly fit with the task, causing possible confusion for the model.

Improvement:

In both instances, the prompt doesn't match the task contextually, causing the model to provide incorrect answers. Therefore, to improve, it's necessary to:

1. Clarify the Task: Make sure that the prompt matches with the type of questions being asked to reduce risk of confusion. In this case, specifically mention "logical entailment" rather than "causal attribution".

2. Reframe the Prompt: The prompt could focus on understanding logical conclusions based on given premises and hypotheses.

3. Include Definitions: You could consider including a short definition or explanation of the concept of 'entailment' as part of the prompt so that it is  clearer for the model. 

4. Direct Clear Instructions: When instructing the model to perform a task, ensure the task is clearly and specifically mentioned. For example, include instructions to take into account assumptions, uncertainties and other nuances in the question.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning <1>:

The reason why this example gets wrong is because the given task in the prompt doesn't align with the question that is being asked. The prompt asks to "answer questions about causal attribution," while the example question asks for identifying a relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. The concept of 'causal attribution' and 'entailment or non-entailment' doesn't coincide and can be confusing to the model. 

The model's response is incorrect because it fails to capture the subtlety of the question. The model assumes that the premise directly contradicts the hypothesis according to the statement, but this is a misunderstanding in terms of entailment logic.

The learner is being asked to engage in a kind of hypothesis-testing or reasoning, but the current prompt does not specify or encourage these cognitive processes. Consequently, the model got confused and made a faulty inference based on the partially relevant prompt.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Make the task explicit: The model got confused because of ambiguity with regards to task. A clearer directive would be: "Identify the logic relationship between the premise and hypothesis, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'".

2. Domain specificity: The prompt needs to be more specific about which type of attribution it's asking for, especially since the question is about entailment logic and not about causal attribution, which would lead to understandings in a completely different domain.

3. Ask for reasoning: Including a request for the model to explain its logic might lead to more accurate inferences and a better understanding of entailment logic and its subtleties.

4. Use examples: A good technique to guide the machine to understand what is expected from it is to use examples. In the description, we can include a similar question and its correct way of resolution. This context can reinforce the machine's understanding and logic deduction in future similar cases.

In conclusion, the ambiguous, overly general nature of the current prompt is leading to logic errors and inaccurate inferences by the AI model.

gradient:
Example 1:

Here, the model mismatched the premise with the hypothesis. The premise is about Thomas recognizing two boys in a dynamic setting which is drastically different from the static school setting of the hypothesis. The model, however, guessed that there's 'non-entailment' relationship between the premise and the hypothesis which, given the data, is incorrect.

Reason: The prompt led to the wrong answer because the AI likely misunderstood the task, identifying the environment and subject misalignment as an indication of non-entailment.

Example 2:

In this example, the model incorrectly marked that there's an 'entailment' relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise includes an additional layer of 'Emma suspects', which means Emma’s observations are not confirmed yet, while the hypothesis omits this layer, denoting certainty.

Reason: The model's mistake is likely due to an overlook of the significance of 'Emma suspects' which transforms the context of the premise; and has potential to change a certain 'fact' into an unverified state.

Example 3:

The model incorrectly identified the relationship as 'non-entailment'. In the premise, Isabella assumes that Michael sees two martial artists while in the hypothesis, Isabella making the same assumption but no mention of Michael. 

Reason: The model's mistake might come from its neglect of the detail about Michael. His absence in the hypothesis shouldn't change the core belief, which remains the same in both sentences i.e., Isabella assuming about two female martial artists doing a demonstration.

Improvement for the prompt:

1. Clarify the Definition: The instructions could better emphasize that identifying entailment or non-entailment is based on the core content rather than the surface-level details of the sentences.

2. Highlight Key Components: Remind the model to carefully examine attribution cues (such as certain beliefs or assumptions) and how they potentially impact the context and change the certainty of the content represented.

3. Specify Common Pitfalls: Specify that entailment doesn't mean identical sentences but rather that the hypothesis can logically be concluded based on the premise information.

4. More Detailed Instructions: Augment the instructions to clearly state how to assess each sentence's facts and how they might correlate or differ which would help identify whether the sentences entail each other. 

5. Examples: Provide examples that illustrate how to correctly identify entailment and non-entailment based on sentences' content, attribution cues, and context.

Wrong Example Analysis:

(1)
Question and Options: 
The premise is 'Richard thinks that Amelia understands that a group of young men in a gym take turns scoring in basketball.' The hypothesis is 'Amelia understands that a group of young men in a gym take turns scoring in basketball.' The options are (A) entailment and (B) non-entailment.

Wrong Answer: 
The model predicts 'entailment', meaning the premise logically leads to the hypothesis, but this is incorrect. In reality, just because Richard thinks Amelia understands something doesn't necessarily mean Amelia actually does.

Reasons for Wrong Answer
- Lack of Understanding about Uncertainty: The model did not factor in the uncertainty inherent in the phrase 'Richard thinks.' This highlights a misunderstanding of the relation between the premise and the hypothesis. 
- Complicated Syntax: The multilayered phrase structure, like "someone thinks someone understands something", could be difficult for the model to parse accurately. 

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:

1. Clearly state that the model should consider differing perspectives in its understanding of information. 
2. Ask the model to account for subjective language or third-party beliefs.
3. Instruct the model to not take assumed knowledge as guaranteed fact.
4. Specifically ask the model to carefully parse sentences with multilayered understandings or complex structures.
5. Request the model to clearly justify its answer, providing a rationale for choosing entailment or non-entailment between premises and hypotheses. 

Here's a potentially improved prompt:

Answer questions about logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, ensuring to understand the perspectives involved and analyze the subjective language. Be aware of complex sentence structures and do not confuse assumed knowledge with guaranteed fact. After identifying the relation as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', provide a clear and logical justification for your choice.

gradient:
Example 1:

1. The prompt instructs the model to "answer questions about logical entailment between premises and hypotheses," which the model does in its response. However, it misinterprets the entailment rules. 

2. The model analysis incorrectly states, "The premise does not entail the hypothesis, as it only states that Thomas sees that Richard believes something, but it does not necessarily mean that Richard actually believes it." Yet the hypothesis is not that Richard believes something; Instead, it's about what Thomas sees Richard believing. The understanding is flawed.

Example 2:

1. Again, the model has not correctly processed the logic. It assumes that if "Robert suspects that Amelia assumes" something, it directly implies "Robert suspects" that thing. But this is a misinterpretation of entailment. 

2. The hypothesis does not state anything about Amelia, which is a crucial part of the premise. The entailed hypothesis should maintain all variables of the premise, hence a misunderstanding.

Reasons for the incorrect answers can be:

1. Misunderstanding of logical entailment: The model incorrectly assesses logical comprehensions in both examples. 

2. Errors in parsing the premise and hypothesis: The AI model failed to correctly analyze the premise and hypothesis, leading to flawed logic.

Aspects for improving the prompt:

1. Define logical entailment: Explicitly define what is meant by 'logical entailment' in the context of the problem.

2. Better elucidate task: Greater emphasis should be placed on specifying the need to thoroughly examine each premise and hypothesis, taking into account each semantic aspect.

3. Role and nature of variables: It could be useful to underline the notion of variables in premises and their vital importance in determining if the hypothesis is an entailment or not.

4. Provide examples: It could be beneficial to add examples of entailment and non-entailment to provide a guide to how to approach and interpret different scenarios. 

The revised prompt could be:
Answer questions about logical entailment between premises and hypotheses. Logical entailment refers to a situation in which the truth of the hypothesis directly arises from the premise. Examine each premise and hypothesis thoroughly, taking into account all the entities and their associated descriptive information. Brackets <answer> and </answer> should encapsulate the final option selected. Consider if changing any aspect in the premise changes the truth of the hypothesis. If yes, it's non-entailment. If no, it's entailment. After your analysis, select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 

Don't forget to provide a brief explanation before the selected answer.

<1> 
The model got this question wrong because it incorrectly assumed that "Michael thinks that Sophia assumes that man with a tattoo is lying down in the sand next to a cow" entails that "Michael thinks that man with tattoo is lying down in the sand next to a cow". However, in logical entailment, Michael thinking what Sophia assumes does not necessarily mean he thinks it himself. This error could have arisen as the prompt did not clearly define or provide the model with a comprehensive knowledge of logical entailment with regards to indirect assumptions.

<2>
In this question, the model incorrectly identified the relationship between the two statements as 'non-entailment'. The error arose similar to the first example, where the model incorrectly inferred that for David to suspect that Abigail understands an event, it does not imply David suspecting that event himself.

<3>
The model failed at this question as it misunderstood that "Emma believes that Sophia suspects that a man with a cap and not wearing shirt is laying a wooden bench" would entail "Emma believes that a man with a cap and not wearing shirt is laying a wooden bench". Yet, believing someone suspects something does not necessarily mean one believes in that something themselves.

From these wrong answers, it is apparent that the model has a misunderstanding of logical entailment in contexts where one person is thinking or assuming another person's thoughts or assumptions. It seems the model is not appreciating the layered complexity of indirect assumptions or beliefs.

Based on these reasons, improvements on the prompt could include:

1. Define or provide a crisp example of logical entailment, and particularly clarify indirect assumptions or beliefs.

2. Encourage the model to consider the context of the relationship between persons involved in the premise and the hypothesis.

3. Ensure that the complexity of indirect assumptions in the premise and hypothesis is taken into account.

4. Specify that the person A's belief about person B's thoughts does not automatically mean this is shared as A's own belief.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and determine logical entailment between given premises and hypotheses, factoring in the intricacies of indirect assumptions or beliefs. Understanding that an individual's awareness or belief about another person's thoughts or assumptions does not imply this is shared as their own belief, conclude if the premises logically entail the hypotheses, selecting your answers from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to acknowledge any potential uncertainties present and highlight your answer at the end, enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze and determine logical entailment between given premises and hypotheses, factoring in the intricacies of indirect assumptions or beliefs. Understanding that an individual's awareness or belief about another person's thoughts or assumptions does not imply this is shared as their own belief, conclude if the premises logically entail the hypotheses, selecting your answers from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to acknowledge any potential uncertainties present and highlight your answer at the end, enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Isabella knows that a man is in front of a dryer in a laundromat with both hands reaching into a bin or basket. Hypothesis: Isabella knows that a man reaches into his laundry basket at the laundromat.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. While the premise states that Isabella knows a man is in front of a dryer with both hands reaching into a bin or basket, it does not explicitly mention that the man is reaching into his laundry basket. Therefore, there is a possibility that the man could be reaching into a different bin or basket, not necessarily his laundry basket. Thus, the premises do not logically entail the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the answer is: (B) non-entailment
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze and determine logical entailment between given premises and hypotheses, factoring in the intricacies of indirect assumptions or beliefs. Understanding that an individual's awareness or belief about another person's thoughts or assumptions does not imply this is shared as their own belief, conclude if the premises logically entail the hypotheses, selecting your answers from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charlotte assumes that an Asian man is praying at a Buddhist temple. Hypothesis: Charlotte assumes that a man is practicing his religion.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premises do not entail the hypothesis. Charlotte assuming that an Asian man is praying at a Buddhist temple does not necessarily mean she assumes that a man is practicing his religion in general. There could be specific cultural or contextual cues that lead her to make the assumption about the man at the Buddhist temple without extending that assumption to all men. Therefore, the premises do not logically entail the hypothesis. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

The initial prompt wording places a heavy emphasis on the intricacies of indirect assumptions, which may have caused the model to scrutinize the details of the situation more than necessary. In this particular example, the model wrongly adds an extra layer of specification to the hypothesis, by assuming that the "laundry basket" must be specifically owned by the man. However, the entailment lies in the action of a man reaching into a basket in the laundromat, not necessarily his own basket. This unnecessary assumption led the model to the wrong conclusion of non-entailment.

The prompt could benefit from adjustments clarifying that the nuances of indirect assumptions should not lead to over-analysis or the addition of unmentioned specifics in the premise or hypothesis. 

Wrong Example 2:

This example also falls into the trap of over-complicating the scenario. The model notes that the assumption about a man praying at a Buddhist temple does not necessarily extend to all men, which is accurate, but irrelevant for this premise and hypothesis. The model and prompt seem to be misunderstanding the use of "a man" as a generic term. In this hypothesis, "a man" refers to the same man mentioned in the premise, not all men in general.

To improve the prompt, specifying that the same individual(s) or object(s) discussed in the premise will be the ones referenced in the hypothesis could help realign this misinterpretation.

Summary of Improvements:

1. Clarify that the intricacies of indirect assumptions should not result in over-analysis or the fleshing out of premise or hypothesis specifics that are not available in the description.

2. Specify that the same individual(s) or object(s) discussed in the premise will be the ones mentioned in the hypothesis, thus deterring the model from generalizing. 

3. Amend the instructions to ensure the model takes into account the context provided, rather than introducing unrelated or excessive external factors. 

4. Stress the importance of straightforward logical deduction, which allows the language model to understand that extra layers of assumption are not necessary in making a conclusion about entailment or non-entailment. 

5. Advise the model to stick strictly to the statements' literal interpretation and not infuse any external perspectives or bias that could lead to misinterpretation.

gradient:
Looking at the provided incorrect example, it appears the model misunderstood the complexities associated with perceived entailment. The wrong example hints at a critical question of understanding and correctly interpreting the mental models and beliefs of the assumed characters.

Errors and potential improvements to the prompt can be summarized as:

1. Ambiguous Instructions: The prompt may be too complex and multi-layered which potentially leads the model to misconstrue the entailment scenario. It emphasizes indirect assumptions or beliefs, potentially prompting the model to overthink the scenario.

   Improvement: Simplify the instruction while still including the important aspects and details. Remove unnecessary complex terms.

2. Incorrect Interpretation of Beliefs: In this example, the model makes an error of retaining the belief of one character (Ava) separated from her belief about another character's knowledge (James). It elevates the idea of 'individual's awareness or belief about another person's thoughts' does not necessarily suggest that the first individual shares the same belief, whereas, in this case, it's likely that Ava does share the belief she presumes James has.

   Improvement: Require the model to take into consideration that people's beliefs about what others know often overlap with their own beliefs.

3. Multiple-choice Formatting: The option labels (A), (B) could interfere with understanding. The model is tasked to choose an answer from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', but the options A and B could cause confusion.

   Improvement: Remove the labels A, B and directly use 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' as options.

4. Lacks Feedback Loop: The prompt does not ask the model to cross-check its decisions or consider alternatives. Models can greatly benefit from a prompt to reconsider its first impulse.

   Improvement: Prompt the model to re-evaluate its conclusions or compare alternatives before making its final judgement.

5. Uncertainty Handling: The instructions in the prompt to 'acknowledge any potential uncertainties present' could be misinterpreted by the model to take a more cautious approach, thereby leading to wrong entailment conclusions.

   Improvement: Specify more explicitly what is meant by 'uncertainties' and guide the model to deal with them in a more detailed manner. For instance, the prompt could specify uncertainties as unclear language, gossip or speculation within the premises or hypotheses.

However, based on the given premise and hypothesis, Thomas's beliefs are conveyed through William's memory, which directly entails the hypothesis, hence the model should identify this as entailment, not non-entailment.

The reasons the prompt might lead to wrong answers could be:
1. The model might not be accurately distinguishing entailment based on evidence in the form of a memory or acknowledgment by a third party. It is interpreting the possibility of miscommunication or misunderstanding, which is not indicated in the premise.
2. The task of identifying indirect assumptions or beliefs may be too complex for the model, leading to an overinterpretation of potential uncertainty in relationships or communication between individuals.
3. The model might be misunderstanding the delineation between personal belief and shared belief mentioned in the prompt, leading it to conclude that since the belief about Thomas is shared by William, it doesn't entail that Thomas actually holds that belief.

Improvements for the prompt could include:
1. Specifying that the model should base its predictions strictly on the information given in the premises and hypotheses, avoiding speculation about possible misunderstandings or miscommunications unless explicitly mentioned.
2. Further clarification on how to handle information given by third parties, and defining whether it should be viewed as direct evidence for entailment.
3. Providing more clear instructions on how the model should interpret indirect assumptions or beliefs.
4. Adjusting the portion of the instruction about personal belief versus shared belief to ensure that it doesn't confuse the model when determining entailment.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and determine logical entailment between given premises and hypotheses, factoring in the intricacies of indirect assumptions or beliefs. Understanding that an individual's awareness or belief about another person's thoughts or assumptions does not imply this is shared as their own belief, conclude if the premises logically entail the hypotheses, selecting your answers from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure to acknowledge any potential uncertainties present and highlight your answer at the end, enclosed within <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William remembers that Thomas believes that a little boy with a red baseball cap is on a bus with boys with yellow baseball caps on. Hypothesis: Thomas believes that a little boy with a red baseball cap is on a bus with boys with yellow baseball caps on.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premises do not logically entail the hypothesis. While William remembers that Thomas believes a certain scenario, it does not necessarily mean that Thomas actually believes it. There could be a misunderstanding or miscommunication between William and Thomas. Therefore, the premises do not lead to the conclusion that Thomas believes the specific scenario described. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that children play in the snow.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Just because Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball, it does not necessarily mean that she assumes children play in the snow in general. It is possible that she only assumes the specific scenario mentioned in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:

1.
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that children play in the snow.
Options:

(B) non-entailment

Wrong Answer: The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Just because Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball, it does not necessarily mean that she assumes children play in the snow in general.

Why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
In this specific example, the model seems to have over-interpreted the instruction to "treat assumptions as uncertainties rather than established fact". This led it to conclude that although Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow, this does not necessarily mean she assumes that children play in the snow in general. Therefore, it incorrectly categorizes the relationship as a 'non-entailment'. 

Aspect to Improve: The instruction that guides the model to treat assumptions as uncertainties needs to be adjusted. The wording may mislead the model into believing than any instance of an assumption does not logically entail general scenarios. 

2.
Why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
The instructions for the model might be too complex and nuanced. The pressure to reflect on the logical relations and treat them as open to interpretation rather than direct cause and effect interactions could have caused the model to overanalyze, leading to the incorrect prediction. 

Aspect to Improve: Simplify the instructions to reduce the risk of overcomplicating the logical relation analysis task for the model.

In conclusion, the prompt could be improved by adjusting the language used when discussing the treatment of assumptions and by simplifying the task's overview and instruction. This should help the model more accurately predict the relationship between premises and hypotheses.

Prompt Analysis:
This task requests that the language model analyze the logical entailment between a premise and a hypothesis, with a specific focus on differing perspectives, assumptions, sentence structure, and complexity. After the analysis, the model is expected to classify the relation as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and provide an explanation for the classification. However, this prompt is vague about the nature of entailment, meaning that the model might concentrate on explicit details rather than implicit ones.

Error Analysis:
The model interpreted the prompt correctly but made a mistake in estimating the entailment between premise and hypothesis. The model focused on the explicit information in the premise rather than the implicit. The premise states that "a gymnast is seen defying gravity as she performs an impressive move several feet above the parallel bars". The use of female pronouns in reference to the gymnast ('she') implies the gymnast is a woman and supports the hypothesis. However, the model considered 'gymnast' as gender neutral, missing the implicit gender clue.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Encourage the model to consider implicit information as well as explicit when determining logical entailment. This may require instruction to pay attention to clues in the syntactic usage (such as gender referencing in this case).
2. Recommend the model to assess both direct and indirect implications from the premise to the hypothesis.
3. Provide clarity on the nature of entailment, i.e., it can be either explicit or implicit based on the provided premise and hypothesis.
4. It would be useful to include explicit instructions for the model to consider gender contexts and their implications in premises and hypotheses—in case of sentences dealing with names, pronouns, or roles.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze questions about logical entailment between premises and hypotheses. Consider differing perspectives and subjective language, treating assumptions as uncertainties rather than established fact. Pay particular attention to complex sentences and subtleties in their structures. After determining whether the premise entails or does not entail the hypothesis, provide a succinct and substantiated rationale for your classification. Reflect on these logical relations and treat them as nuanced matters open to interpretation rather than direct cause and effect interactions.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze questions about logical entailment between premises and hypotheses. Consider differing perspectives and subjective language, treating assumptions as uncertainties rather than established fact. Pay particular attention to complex sentences and subtleties in their structures. After determining whether the premise entails or does not entail the hypothesis, provide a succinct and substantiated rationale for your classification. Reflect on these logical relations and treat them as nuanced matters open to interpretation rather than direct cause and effect interactions.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
This scenario involves a nuanced interpretation of the premises and hypotheses. While the premise states that Olivia suspects a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna, it does not explicitly mention the man being completely naked. Therefore, the hypothesis that Olivia suspects a human not wearing any clothes is in a room is not necessarily entailed by the premise. Olivia's suspicion could be based on the man wearing a towel rather than being completely naked. Thus, there is a possibility that Olivia's suspicion does not extend to the man being fully unclothed. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia learns that Evelyn assumes that two men playing in a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that two men playing in a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not entail the hypothesis. 

Rationale: The premise states that Olivia learns that Evelyn assumes something, but it does not necessarily mean that Evelyn actually assumes that specific scenario with two men playing in a beautiful lake surrounded by mountains. There could be other assumptions Evelyn has made that Olivia is aware of. Therefore, the premise does not directly lead to the hypothesis.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle. Hypothesis: Charlotte suspects that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Charlotte may suspect that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle without Olivia knowing about it. The premise only states that Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects something, but it does not specify what Charlotte suspects. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be definitively inferred from the premise.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Abigail understands that two people play horseshoes. Hypothesis: Ava believes that two people play horseshoes.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Just because Ava believes that Abigail understands that two people play horseshoes does not necessarily mean that Ava believes that two people play horseshoes. Ava's belief about Abigail's understanding does not directly imply Ava's own belief about the activity. Therefore, the correct option is (B) non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Analyzing each example:

<1> The model incorrectly interprets the task of entailment in reading literal meanings. The uncertainty over whether wearing a towel is the equivalent of not wearing clothes causes the model to answer non-entailment. The model weighs too heavily on the assumptions and uncertainties, causing it to conclude incorrectly.

<2> The model makes an unnecessary assumption that the transferred information may be faulty or incomplete, leading to a non-entailment decision. This is likely due to the prompt asking the model to treat assumptions as uncertainties rather than established fact.

<3> Similarly to <2>, the model misinterprets knowing someone's thoughts as having the potential for miscommunication or misunderstanding, leading to a non-entailment outcome. The model, encouraged by the prompt, overly considers potential uncertainties in the information flow.

<4> The model has misread the premise. It doesn't realize that for Ava to believe that Abigail understands something, Ava herself would need to believe it. This may have been caused by the model's instruction to question assumptions and consider differing perspectives, causing it to overlook an obvious logical entailment.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clarify what entailment means: Instead of focusing the prompt on uncertainty and subtleties, emphasize that entailment considers if the hypothesis can be deduced logically and inevitably from the premise.

2. Limit the focus on uncertainties: While highlighting the importance of questioning assumptions may be suitable for other tasks, for entailment tasks it leads to an overly skeptical approach that overlooks clear entailments. Clearly mention that not all assumptions are uncertainties and should be critically evaluated based on the premise provided rather than potential ambiguities.

3. Balance perspectives: Instead of suggesting biases towards questioning every detail, prompt the model to maintain a balance between scrutinizing the information and reading it at face value.

4. Direct attention to logical flows: The prompt should encourage the model to pay more attention to logical connections and information flow between elements in the premise and hypothesis.

(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: The model interpretation of the question is incorrect. The premise does not entail the hypothesis. Just because 'Robert suspects that Charlotte assumes that three people are dressed in costumes and playing musical instruments' doesn't necessarily mean 'Charlotte assumes that three people are dressed in costumes and playing musical instruments' is true. It is just a suspicion of Robert, which doesn't confirm the hypothesis. 

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Wrong Answer Reasoning: Again, the model interprets the prompt incorrectly. Just because 'Ava believes that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees', doesn't mean that 'Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees' is true. The premise only reflects Ava's belief, which does not confirm the hypothesis.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Specify in the prompt that the model needs to consider a logical understanding of the relationship between premises and hypotheses.
2. Make clear that subjective opinions, feelings, beliefs, suspicions do not necessarily imply entailment because they don't confirm the validity of the hypothesis.
3. Highlight the difference between the model's understanding of "entailment" and "non-entailment", stressing the strict validity requirement for the former. 
4. Suggestions can also be included for the model to consider whether the premises objectively demonstrate the hypothesis as true, without the reliance on individual perspectives.
5. The prompt could instruct the model to critically evaluate if a premise directly supports a hypothesis or just provides a context or opinion.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Evaluate the logical relationship between given premises and hypotheses, defining whether it is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide your reasoning for each selection.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Evaluate the logical relationship between given premises and hypotheses, defining whether it is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide your reasoning for each selection.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Sophia suspects that Robert suspects that women is small tops and skirts pose for the camera. Hypothesis: Sophia suspects that women is small tops and skirts pose for the camera.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. This is because the premise explicitly states that Sophia suspects that Robert suspects that women in small tops and skirts pose for the camera, which implies that Sophia herself suspects the same thing. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Evaluate the logical relationship between given premises and hypotheses, defining whether it is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide your reasoning for each selection.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor believes that Joseph knows that numerous customers browsing for produce in a market. Hypothesis: Joseph knows that numerous customers browsing for produce in a market.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. This is because if Taylor believes that Joseph knows that numerous customers are browsing for produce in a market, then it follows that Joseph indeed knows that numerous customers are browsing for produce in a market. Therefore, the premise entails the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The first error in these examples seems to arise from a misunderstanding of the nature of 'belief' or 'suspicion'. The fact that one person believes or suspects that another person knows or believes something doesn't necessarily mean that the second person truly knows or believes it. It's an assumption - correct or incorrect - from the first person. So, the notion that because "Sophia suspects that Robert suspects that women in small tops and skirts pose for the camera" that this entails that "women in small tops and skirts pose for the camera" is incorrect. Same reasoning applies for the second example.

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
1. Misinterpretation of Belief/Suspicion: The model fails to understand that belief or suspicion of one person does not automatically validate the belief or suspicion of another.
2. Absence of Syllogism Understanding: The model seems not to fully grasp the concept of logical syllogism, in which the truth of the premises guarantees the truth of the conclusion.

Improvements that can be added to the prompt:
1. Elaborate on Beliefs/Suspicions: Make clear in the prompt that the statement of belief or suspicion of one person does not automatically entail the belief or suspicion of another.
2. Explain Syllogism Concept: A more nuanced explanation of what 'entailment' means might be beneficial, especially emphasizing that it's a guarantee, not just a possibility.
3. Provide More Context: Including clearer instructions on how to evaluate logical relationships might deliver better outcomes.
4. Scope Down: The prompt should contain clarification that the model is responsible for estimating the logical relation based on the explicit information of the sentences only.
5. Provide Examples: Supplying the model with clear examples of entailment and non-entailment can help sharpen its understanding.

Wrong Example Breakdown:

In this example, the mistake lies not in the prompt but in the model's response. The model's interpretation of the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is incorrect. The model made an incorrect assumption - despite the premise indicating that 'Emma sees that John thinks a man with a bat swings at a ball coming towards him', this does not necessarily mean 'John thinks that Emma sees the same thing.' Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise; it is a case of 'non-entailment'. 

Reasons for wrong answers:
1. Incorrect Assumption: The model wrongly assumed that if 'A sees that B thinks something', it must suggest 'B thinks that A sees the same thing'. This is faulty logic as one's perception cannot be automatically reciprocated by the other person.

2. Lack of Complex Reasoning: The task at hand requires complex reasoning abilities involving perception and assumptions. The model's inability to comprehend the complexity led it to the wrong conclusion.

3. Understanding of 'Entailment': The model could have an incorrect understanding of 'entailment', considering it to be only about the presence of similar elements in both premise and hypothesis. 

Ways to improve the prompt:
1. Include Definitions: Clear definitions of the terms 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt may help the model in better understanding the task.

2. Provide Sample Relations: If possible, including examples of logical relations such as 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt may help the model better understand the kind of reasoning required.

3. Encourage Deeper Analysis: Instruct the model to make no assumptions, analyze the subtleties in the dilemma, and carefully assess whether the hypothesis is an undeniable outcome of the premise or not. 

4. Highlight Reciprocal Understanding: Emphasize that the actions and thoughts of one individual cannot be automatically assumed to be perceived or reciprocated by another. 

Remember, the model's capabilities are also a determining factor here; even the best prompt may not yield the right result if the model itself is incapable of the complex logical reasoning needed for the task. But with ongoing improvements, the results should improve correspondingly.

gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> The model's reasoning is somewhat misdirected. The error lies in how the model interprets the premise, where it's not focusing on traversing the facts from the premise to the hypothesis. The fact in the premise "Isabella sees that David assumes that a black woman is sitting on the beach examining an octopus" implies that David indeed assumes it. Thus, it leads to an entailment with the hypothesis "David assumes that a black woman is sitting on the beach examining an octopus". The model overthinks, adding ambiguity by introducing aspects of misunderstanding or misinterpretation, which is not implicitly or explicitly mentioned in the prompt.

<2> The model misidentifies the relationship between 'Richard's belief about David's memory' and 'what Richard himself believes'. The model incorrectly assesses that the premise doesn't state Richard himself believes the scenario. However, for Richard to believe David's memory, the premise subtly implies that Richard indeed believes the same scenario. The model failed to bridge this connection and incorrectly concluded it as non-entailment.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Distinguish personal beliefs: The instruction "one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person" may be confusing for the model. Revise to clarify the relationship between different individual's beliefs and how they might entail one another.

2. Instruct against overthinking: The model tends to add ambiguity which is not implicitly or explicitly presented in the sentences. Direct the model to adhere strictly to the provided information without inferring or introducing unmentioned possibilities.

3. Entailment Understanding: The model sometimes makes the mistake in knowing which parts of the premise necessarily imply the hypothesis. Include in the prompt a more specific explanation of 'entailment' to improve its understanding.

4. Inference from Indirect Facts: Train the model to deduce beliefs from indirect facts. For example, if a person believes someone else's memory, it implies that the person also believes the memory by themselves.

5. Unambiguous Instructions: Make sure instructions are clear and direct so that the model is sure of what is expected in its analysis and conclusions.

This does not necessarily mean that David actually assumes this; it could be a misunderstanding or misinterpretation on Isabella's part. Therefore, there is a non-entailment relation between the premise and hypothesis.

<answer>B</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Determine the logical implications between the provided premises and hypotheses, ensuring to critically evaluate if it's an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Consider that one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person. Also, bear in mind that 'entailment' suggests that the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Provide clear reasoning behind every choice, considering only the explicit information in the sentences. At the end let your selection be option A for 'entailment' and B for 'non-entailment', and place the answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard believes that David remembers that a man is sitting on a blue bench with a blue blanket covering his face. Hypothesis: Richard believes that a man is sitting on a blue bench with a blue blanket covering his face.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Richard believes that David remembers a specific scenario involving a man sitting on a blue bench with a blue blanket covering his face. However, it does not explicitly state that Richard believes the same scenario himself. Therefore, the hypothesis that Richard believes a man is sitting on a blue bench with a blue blanket covering his face is not necessarily entailed by the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>B</answer> (non-entailment).

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> The model's reasoning is somewhat misdirected. The error lies in how the model interprets the premise, where it's not focusing on traversing the facts from the premise to the hypothesis. The fact in the premise "Isabella sees that David assumes that a black woman is sitting on the beach examining an octopus" implies that David indeed assumes it. Thus, it leads to an entailment with the hypothesis "David assumes that a black woman is sitting on the beach examining an octopus". The model overthinks, adding ambiguity by introducing aspects of misunderstanding or misinterpretation, which is not implicitly or explicitly mentioned in the prompt.

<2> The model misidentifies the relationship between 'Richard's belief about David's memory' and 'what Richard himself believes'. The model incorrectly assesses that the premise doesn't state Richard himself believes the scenario. However, for Richard to believe David's memory, the premise subtly implies that Richard indeed believes the same scenario. The model failed to bridge this connection and incorrectly concluded it as non-entailment.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Distinguish personal beliefs: The instruction "one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person" may be confusing for the model. Revise to clarify the relationship between different individual's beliefs and how they might entail one another.

2. Instruct against overthinking: The model tends to add ambiguity which is not implicitly or explicitly presented in the sentences. Direct the model to adhere strictly to the provided information without inferring or introducing unmentioned possibilities.

3. Entailment Understanding: The model sometimes makes the mistake in knowing which parts of the premise necessarily imply the hypothesis. Include in the prompt a more specific explanation of 'entailment' to improve its understanding.

4. Inference from Indirect Facts: Train the model to deduce beliefs from indirect facts. For example, if a person believes someone else's memory, it implies that the person also believes the memory by themselves.

5. Unambiguous Instructions: Make sure instructions are clear and direct so that the model is sure of what is expected in its analysis and conclusions.

gradient:
Wrong example 1:

Question: Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.

The model's wrong answer: The premise states that William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. This does not necessarily mean that William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread himself. William could believe that Michael knows this information without personally holding the belief that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Therefore, there is a non-entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

Reason: The model seems to consider the cognitive states of the different persons involved: William and Michael. The instruction to "consider that one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person" potentially led to this misunderstanding. However, the model seems to miss out on the detail that if "William thinks that Michael knows something," it also implies inherently that William thinks that "something" is true. The prompt could be more explicit about the need to interpret entailment relationships when they involve multiple individuals.

Wrong example 2:

Question: Premise: William assumes that adults and children share in the looking at something, and some young ladies stand to the side. Hypothesis: William assumes that some children are looking.

The model's wrong answer: The premise states that William assumes that adults and children share in looking at something, and some young ladies stand to the side. This does not explicitly guarantee that some children are looking, as it is possible that the children are not looking despite being present. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>B</answer> (non-entailment).

Reason: The model seems to have misinterpreted the phrase "share in the looking at something." While "sharing in looking" can be considered ambiguous, in the context of the premise, it would typically be interpreted as "both groups partake in the action of looking." The model does not appear to infer this from the sentence, which led to it predicting non-entailment. The prompt could have emphasized interpreting the phrases in their most common meaning when the explicit information is provided.


Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Clarify instructions: Clearly indicate that if 'Person A thinks that Person B knows something,' it inherently implies that Person A thinks that 'something' is true. Clarify the meaning of when two entities 'share' an action in the prompt.
   
2. Emphasise critical thinking: Encourage the model to critically evaluate the relationship between premises and hypotheses, especially when they involve complex cognitive states and common phrase interpretations.

3. Specific instructions for ambiguity: Guide the model to favor common interpretations of phrases over less likely interpretations when dealing with potential ambiguities in language.

4. Incorporate logic principles: Specify that the model needs to apply principles of conventional logic, such as if both adults and children are sharing in an activity, one can deduce that both adults and children are doing the activity. 

5. Reinforce explicit information use: Reinforce the instruction to take into account only the explicit information and ignore any potential external assumptions.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that William believes the man is sweeping with a red broom, but it does not mention anything about what William believes the man is sweeping.

Example Review:

In this example, the language model observed that the premise does not explicitly state that "William believes that the man is sweeping dirt." This, along with the prompt highlighting to consider only the explicit information in the sentences, leads the model to select 'non-entailment'. 

The model may have been tripped up by the aspect in the prompt that states, "Consider that one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person". While this statement is true, it may have led the model to overly emphasize the lack of explicit information about what William believes the man is sweeping. 

The model could also have been confused by the task because the concept of entailment is ambiguous. Although the prompt explained that entailment implies that the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion, it didn't necessarily explain how that might apply in the context of this particular task. 

Improving the prompt:

1. Clarification on implicit information: The initial prompt instructions could emphasize the importance of evaluating implied truths or conclusions from the available explicit information in the statements.

2. Smoothening understanding of entailment: The model would also benefit from more precise instructions about how to evaluate whether the premise guarantees the conclusion.

3. Expanding the definition of Entailment: The explanation can include that if the premise is true, then the hypothesized scenario is also likely to be true. 

4. Adding examples: The prompt could include examples of entailment and non-entailment, which would provide the model with a clearer understanding of how to evaluate the hypotheses and premises. 

5. Clarifying the belief concept: reaffirm that a person's belief can be multi-faceted and logical implications might still be derived, even when not explicitly mentioned. 

These changes can potentially assist the model in holistically interpreting the task and delivering accurate predictions.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom. Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that William believes the man is sweeping with a red broom, but it does not mention anything about what William believes the man is sweeping. Therefore, there is no logical guarantee that William believes the man is sweeping dirt just because he believes the man is using a red broom. Hence, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>B</answer> (non-entailment).

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example Review:

In this example, the language model observed that the premise does not explicitly state that "William believes that the man is sweeping dirt." This, along with the prompt highlighting to consider only the explicit information in the sentences, leads the model to select 'non-entailment'. 

The model may have been tripped up by the aspect in the prompt that states, "Consider that one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person". While this statement is true, it may have led the model to overly emphasize the lack of explicit information about what William believes the man is sweeping. 

The model could also have been confused by the task because the concept of entailment is ambiguous. Although the prompt explained that entailment implies that the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion, it didn't necessarily explain how that might apply in the context of this particular task. 

Improving the prompt:

1. Clarification on implicit information: The initial prompt instructions could emphasize the importance of evaluating implied truths or conclusions from the available explicit information in the statements.

2. Smoothening understanding of entailment: The model would also benefit from more precise instructions about how to evaluate whether the premise guarantees the conclusion.

3. Expanding the definition of Entailment: The explanation can include that if the premise is true, then the hypothesized scenario is also likely to be true. 

4. Adding examples: The prompt could include examples of entailment and non-entailment, which would provide the model with a clearer understanding of how to evaluate the hypotheses and premises. 

5. Clarifying the belief concept: reaffirm that a person's belief can be multi-faceted and logical implications might still be derived, even when not explicitly mentioned. 

These changes can potentially assist the model in holistically interpreting the task and delivering accurate predictions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the logical relationship between given premises and hypotheses, defining whether it is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide your reasoning for each selection.
(2) Determine the logical implications between the provided premises and hypotheses, ensuring to critically evaluate if it's an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Consider that one person's belief or suspicion does not automatically imply the same for another person. Also, bear in mind that 'entailment' suggests that the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion. Provide clear reasoning behind every choice, considering only the explicit information in the sentences. At the end let your selection be option A for 'entailment' and B for 'non-entailment', and place the answer option between <answer> and </answer>.

Remember, personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions may not always amount to entailment, as these elements lack objectivity.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail believes that John learns that two people in coats kiss on the side of a road. Hypothesis: Abigail believes that two people in coats kiss on the side of a road.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail believes that John learns that two people in coats kiss on the side of a road. The hypothesis states that Abigail believes that two people in coats kiss on the side of a road. 

There is a non-entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Just because Abigail believes that John learns about an event does not necessarily mean that she believes in the event herself. The premise provides context about what John learns, but it does not directly support the hypothesis that Abigail believes in the event. 

Therefore, the answer is <B>non-entailment</B>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Premise: Abigail assumes that James thinks that a little girl carries a younger girl on the sidewalk. Hypothesis: James thinks that a little girl carries a younger girl on the sidewalk.
Options:

(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail assumes that James thinks that a little girl carries a younger girl on the sidewalk. This does not necessarily mean that James actually thinks that. It is possible that Abigail's assumption is incorrect or based on incomplete information. Therefore, the premise does not logically lead to the hypothesis that James thinks a little girl carries a younger girl on the sidewalk. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In the first example:

The model made an incorrect assumption while analyzing the premise and hypothesis. The model reasoned that just because Abigail believes that John learns about an event ("two people in coats kiss on the side of the road"), it does not necessarily mean that she believes in the event herself. But in logical reasoning, if Abigail believes in something about John, she must have a belief in the matter herself. Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis as Abigail's belief that John learns that two people in coats kiss is a strong indicator of her own belief of the same happening. The model's analysis on this question wrongly separated 'belief' and the 'event' being believed and miss the logical entailment.

In the second example:

Here, the model has made a mistake in the output. Although the model correctly identifies the relationship as 'non-entailment', it tags the answer choice wrongly as 'A.' This could be due to a misunderstanding or a technical error in selecting the correct answer choice.

To improve the prompt:

Part of the problem may be the prompt's instruction itself. It encourages the model to dismiss personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions as not necessarily implying entailment. But in cases where the premise and hypothesis both involve personal beliefs, the model might end up incorrectly dismissing the entailment.

1. The instruction to the AI model can be further clarified by explicitly stating that entailment deals with the purely logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. If 'A' logically implies 'B', despite individual perspectives, there is an entailment.

2. Additionally, it should be explicitly instructed that personal beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions, when part of the premise, are to be considered as facts. Remind the model not to speculate on the accuracy of personal beliefs but assume the premise is factual.

3. Correct the technical problem that leads to the wrong label being associated with correct answers.

4. Clear instructions that the model must align its textual reasoning with the final answer choice.

gradient:
Reasons for incorrect answers:

1) Misinterpretation of the task: The model may be misunderstanding the task. Instead of analyzing whether the premise logically supports the hypothesis, it seems to be adding in elements of doubt and assumptions, which is explicitly cautioned against in the prompt. The prompt clearly states that personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions should not influence the decision, but the model seems to base its answer on the possibility that Emma's suspicion might be wrong, leading to an incorrect answer.

2) Overemphasis on personal interpretation: The model overcompensates for the prompt's warning against personal biases by avoiding an obvious entailment. The prompt asks the model not to rely on individual perspectives, but it seems to neglect the clear logical relationship where the premise absolutely leads to the given hypothesis.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1) Clarity on entailment: The prompt could be more explicit about what an entailment means. Entailment here refers to a scenario where the truth of the hypothesis is absolutely guaranteed by the truth of the premise, regardless of the source of the premise.

2) Reinforcing guidelines: The caution against personal beliefs and assumptions could be accentuated to ensure the model doesn't introduce its own doubts or possibilities into the logical analysis.

3) Examples: Including a clear example or two demonstrating what entailment and non-entailment look like might be beneficial for the language model.

In summary, the improved prompt would look something like this:

Understand the task at hand clearly - it involves discerning purely logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. You need to assess if 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' exists, yuxtaposing only the given statements. Remember, an 'entailment' means that the truth of the premise absolutely guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Do not introduce personal beliefs, assumptions, or imagined scenarios which could inflame bias or distort the true logical relationship. Rein in any bias, focus only on the given information. Is the premise logically enforcing the hypothesis, or is it just a standalone fact or opinion? Provide a logical explanation of your process and choice. Conclude with your chosen answer option, placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

Instead of analyzing whether the premise logically supports the hypothesis, it seems to be adding in elements of doubt and assumptions, which is explicitly cautioned against in the prompt. The prompt clearly states that personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions should not influence the decision, but the model seems to base its answer on the possibility that Emma's suspicion might be wrong, leading to an incorrect answer.

2) Overemphasis on personal interpretation: The model overcompensates for the prompt's warning against personal biases by avoiding an obvious entailment. The prompt asks the model not to rely on individual perspectives, but it seems to neglect the clear logical relationship where the premise absolutely leads to the given hypothesis.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1) Clarity on entailment: The prompt could be more explicit about what an entailment means. Entailment here refers to a scenario where the truth of the hypothesis is absolutely guaranteed by the truth of the premise, regardless of the source of the premise.

2) Reinforcing guidelines: The caution against personal beliefs and assumptions could be accentuated to ensure the model doesn't introduce its own doubts or possibilities into the logical analysis.

3) Examples: Including a clear example or two demonstrating what entailment and non-entailment look like might be beneficial for the language model.

In summary, the improved prompt would look something like this:

Understand the task at hand clearly - it involves discerning purely logical relationships between premises and hypotheses. You need to assess if 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' exists, yuxtaposing only the given statements. Remember, an 'entailment' means that the truth of the premise absolutely guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. Do not introduce personal beliefs, assumptions, or imagined scenarios which could inflame bias or distort the true logical relationship. Rein in any bias, focus only on the given information. Is the premise logically enforcing the hypothesis, or is it just a standalone fact or opinion? Provide a logical explanation of your process and choice. Conclude with your chosen answer option, placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate the logical relationship between given premises and hypotheses, defining whether it is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide your reasoning for each selection.
(2) Examine these given premises and hypotheses meticulously, focusing on the pure logical relationship between them. Establish if there is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions may not always amount to entailment, as these elements lack objectivity. Analyze whether the premise objectively, without reliance on individual perspectives, truly supports the hypothesis or if it merely provides a context or opinion. Clearly explain the reasoning behind your selection. Conclude with the chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

<START> Your task is to logically analyze the relationships between the provided premises and hypotheses. Determine if there's an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between them. Keep these points in mind: 
1. An 'entailment' exists when the truth of the hypothesis is unquestionably guaranteed by the truth of the premise. 
2. Do not let personal beliefs, assumptions, or conjectures play a part in your decision. The aim is to make an objective, logic-based judgment, without bringing in subjective elements like potential doubts and imaginations. 
3. Focus solely on the information within the premise and hypothesis, without reliance on any additional outside contexts, opinions, or personal interpretations. 
Assess and explain why you choose entailment or non-entailment with a good logical deduction. Once you reach a conclusion, indicate your answer selection by wrapping it between <answer> and </answer>. 

Through this process, you'll truly find if the hypothesis absolutely follows from the premise (entailment), or if the premise simply provides irrelevant facts or context that do not guarantee the hypothesis (non-entailment).

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Amelia sees that John suspects that the man in the white shirt holds up a playing card. Hypothesis: John suspects that Amelia sees that the man in the white shirt holds up a playing card.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Amelia sees that John suspects that the man in the white shirt holds up a playing card. The hypothesis states that John suspects that Amelia sees that the man in the white shirt holds up a playing card.

There is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. If Amelia sees that John suspects something, then it logically follows that John suspects that Amelia sees the same thing. Therefore, the premise supports the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James suspects that Michael thinks that three black people, two men and one woman, in the middle of a small, rural street, are piling up items on top of a taxi cab with a net dangling down on top of the windshield, while two children and two other people are nearby. Hypothesis: Michael thinks that three black people, two men and one woman, in the middle of a small, rural street, are piling up items on top of a taxi cab with a net dangling down on top of the windshield, while two children and two other people are nearby.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James suspects that Michael thinks a specific scenario is happening. The hypothesis is that Michael actually thinks the same scenario is happening. Since the premise directly mentions that Michael thinks this scenario, it logically follows that the hypothesis is supported by the premise. Therefore, there is entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this example, the model fails to comprehend the intricate relationship between 'seeing' and 'suspecting'. The premise states Amelia 'sees' John's suspicion, but it does not imply John 'suspects' Amelia's perception. Hence, no entailment exists. The model might fail to solve such complicated prompts due to the high level of understanding required about the difference between 'seeing' and 'suspecting'.

Example 2:
Here, the model confuses between 'James’s suspicion' and 'Michael's thought'. Just because James suspects Michael thinks something, it doesn't necessarily mean Michael actually thinks it. Hence, it's a non-entailment case. The prompt leads to a wrong conclusion because it does not emphasize dissecting each element in the statement and understanding that suspicion does not necessarily equate to reality.

Improvements to the Prompt:
1. Emphasize a deeper comprehension of 'contextual' and 'conceptual' meaning of terms like 'sees', 'thinks', 'suspects' etc., as these might be areas causing confusion.
2. Stress on the need to evaluate every individual element in the premise and not to draw conclusions based on general understanding.
3. Reinforce specificity- to not treat the 'suspecting' and 'knowing' as the same entity.
4. Remind to differentiate between 'someone's thoughts' and 'another's suspicion about those thoughts', as they don't equate to each other.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail sees that Sophia thinks that a group of female athletes are huddled together and excited. The hypothesis suggests that Sophia thinks that Abigail sees that a group of female athletes are huddled together and excited. 

There is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise directly implies the hypothesis because it establishes the chain of events where Abigail sees Sophia's thoughts about the group of female athletes. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example <1>:
In this example, the language model misunderstood the concept of entailment. The premise refers to Michael's assumption about Richard's belief, while the hypothesis states Richard's belief directly. For entailment to exist, if Michael's assumption is correct, Richard's belief must be true. However, assumptions don't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, regardless of the content of the assumption. This kind of logical relationship is hard to discern, particularly when the statement involves personal beliefs or assumptions, which can be subjective and uncertain.

Example <2>:
Similarly, in the second example, the model misunderstood the premise and the hypothesis's relationship. The premise is about Abigail's observation of Sophia's thoughts, but the hypothesis inverts that relationship, with Sophia thinking about what Abigail sees. Even though the situation is the same (female athletes huddling together), the perception considerer differs. Hence, the premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis. Entailment would exist if the premise's truth guarantees or requires the truth of the hypothesis. This misinterpretation could be due to the complexity of the statements and the inaccurate representation of entailment in the instructions.

Improvements:
1. Add clear information and examples about logical entailment, emphasizing that what A perceives about B doesn't necessarily entail what B perceives about A.
2. Highlight that assumptions are not guarantees and do not always logically imply the truth.	
3. Refine the instructions regarding personal beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions to underscore that although they should be considered as factual parts of the premise, they often involve uncertainties.
4. Provide examples emphasizing both successful entailment and lack of entailment where scenarios are similar but perception roles are inverted.
5. Reframe instructions to underline that the task is not just about identifying shared elements in the premise and hypothesis but deciphering whether the truth of the premise necessitates the truth of the hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Michael assumes that Richard believes that several children are standing on the beach. Hypothesis: Richard believes that several children are standing on the beach.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Michael assumes that Richard believes that several children are standing on the beach. This implies that Michael's assumption is based on Richard's belief. Therefore, there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The hypothesis directly follows from the premise as it is the belief attributed to Richard by Michael.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given premises and hypotheses with great care, focusing solely on the logical relationships between them. Determine whether there is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind, when analyzing entailment, we are considering if 'A' logically implies 'B', moving away from individual perceptions. Even when the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, take them as a factual part for the premise in this context, without questioning their validity. Do not mistakenly dismiss these elements as extraneous but treat them as important parts of the premise.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail sees that Sophia thinks that a group of female athletes are huddled together and excited. Hypothesis: Sophia thinks that Abigail sees that a group of female athletes are huddled together and excited.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail sees that Sophia thinks that a group of female athletes are huddled together and excited. The hypothesis suggests that Sophia thinks that Abigail sees that a group of female athletes are huddled together and excited. 

There is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise directly implies the hypothesis because it establishes the chain of events where Abigail sees Sophia's thoughts about the group of female athletes. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example <1>:
In this example, the language model misunderstood the concept of entailment. The premise refers to Michael's assumption about Richard's belief, while the hypothesis states Richard's belief directly. For entailment to exist, if Michael's assumption is correct, Richard's belief must be true. However, assumptions don't guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, regardless of the content of the assumption. This kind of logical relationship is hard to discern, particularly when the statement involves personal beliefs or assumptions, which can be subjective and uncertain.

Example <2>:
Similarly, in the second example, the model misunderstood the premise and the hypothesis's relationship. The premise is about Abigail's observation of Sophia's thoughts, but the hypothesis inverts that relationship, with Sophia thinking about what Abigail sees. Even though the situation is the same (female athletes huddling together), the perception considerer differs. Hence, the premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis. Entailment would exist if the premise's truth guarantees or requires the truth of the hypothesis. This misinterpretation could be due to the complexity of the statements and the inaccurate representation of entailment in the instructions.

Improvements:
1. Add clear information and examples about logical entailment, emphasizing that what A perceives about B doesn't necessarily entail what B perceives about A.
2. Highlight that assumptions are not guarantees and do not always logically imply the truth.	
3. Refine the instructions regarding personal beliefs, assumptions, and perceptions to underscore that although they should be considered as factual parts of the premise, they often involve uncertainties.
4. Provide examples emphasizing both successful entailment and lack of entailment where scenarios are similar but perception roles are inverted.
5. Reframe instructions to underline that the task is not just about identifying shared elements in the premise and hypothesis but deciphering whether the truth of the premise necessitates the truth of the hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles assumes that Abigail assumes that a woman in skirt, torn stockings and combat boots and a man in aviators and batman tank top walk down a city street. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that a woman in skirt, torn stockings and combat boots and a man in aviators and batman tank top walk down a city street.
Options:
(A) entailment

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles assumes that Abigail assumes that a woman in a skirt, torn stockings, and combat boots and a man in aviators and a Batman tank top walk down a city street. The hypothesis is that Abigail assumes the same thing. 

In this case, the premise directly states that Abigail assumes the specific scenario described, so there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The hypothesis is a direct consequence of the premise provided.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph knows that James suspects that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna. Hypothesis: James suspects that Joseph knows that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph knows that James suspects a specific scenario involving a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna. The hypothesis suggests that James suspects that Joseph knows the same scenario. 

There is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. If Joseph knows that James suspects the scenario described, then it logically follows that James suspects that Joseph knows the same scenario. The knowledge of Joseph about James's suspicion implies that James's suspicion extends to Joseph's knowledge of the situation.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

The model in the first example misunderstood the difference of 'believing that someone believes' with 'someone believes'. Technically, 'Charles assumes Abigail assumes X' does not directly imply 'Abigail assumes X'. Abigail's assumptions could have been incorrectly perceived by Charles or simply not expressed accurately. Because the model was instructed to focus solely on the logical relationships between the premise and the hypotheses, and was told not to question the validity of assumptions involved in the premise, it failed to grasp the subtlety of subjective perspectives of two different individuals.

Example 2:

In the second example, the model made a similar mistake. The premise 'Joseph knows that James suspects Y' does not necessarily imply 'James suspects that Joseph knows Y'. The hypothesis adds an extra layer of complexity by stating that James is aware of Joseph's knowledge, which isn't entailed by the premise. However, because the instructions asked the model not to question the validity of personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, the model overgeneralized and made an incorrect entailment inference.

Improvements:

1. Clarify that when the premise involves another person’s beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, the model needs to consider the complexity of individual knowledge. Specifically, 'A believes that B believes X' does not automatically mean 'B believes X'.
    
2. Include examples of sentences with layered subjectivity in the prompt to guide the model in understanding that one person's assumption/belief about another person's belief/assumption does not constitute entailment.

3. While asking the model to move away from individual perceptions, ensure that the model does not incorrectly generalize beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions of individuals.

4. In the instructions, emphasize the importance of attentive reading and not to overgeneralize perspectives of different individuals. 

5. Make sure the model understands that when the subjective perceptions overlap between premise and hypothesis, it doesn't necessarily imply entailment.

6. Instead of telling the model not to question the validity of the premise, instruct the model not to question the truth value, but allow it to analyze each part's individual meaning. 

Overall, the prompt needs to make it clear that the entailment is not just about logical connections but also requires an understanding of the nuances of individual perspectives, assumptions, and beliefs.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the given premises and hypotheses with great care, focusing solely on the logical relationships between them. Determine whether there is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind, when analyzing entailment, we are considering if 'A' logically implies 'B', moving away from individual perceptions. Even when the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, take them as a factual part for the premise in this context, without questioning their validity. Do not mistakenly dismiss these elements as extraneous but treat them as important parts of the premise. Consider whether the premise, independent of personal perspectives, directly underpins the hypothesis or only provides a context or standpoint. Provide a detailed explanation for your choice and make sure that your conclusion matches with your textual reasoning. Sum up your answer by bracketing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail assumes the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. This assumption does not directly imply that the tennis player is playing tennis. It is possible for someone to spike a tennis ball on the boundary line without actually playing tennis. Therefore, there is a non-entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In this example, the model incorrectly concluded that the premise "Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line" does not entail the hypothesis "Abigail assumes that the tennis player is playing tennis". The error seems to be caused by the model considering a different interpretation of what is meant by "playing tennis", which includes an organized or formal context.

The model's understanding of the premise doesn't seem to align with the prompt's instruction to take personal beliefs, assumptions or suspicions as factual parts of the premise. The model questions the validity of the premise's implication by suggesting the hypothetical scenario of someone spiking a tennis ball on the boundary line without actually playing tennis. But according to the provided instructions, the model is expected to accept the premise as it is, and from there, decide whether it implies the hypothesis.

Suggestions for Improvement:

1. The prompt can be modified to emphasise that the focus should be strictly on the logical consequence of the premises and not on any alternative scenarios or interpretations not directly suggested by the text.

2. The language model possibly misunderstood the task at hand. Therefore, adding more specific instructions that clarify the task and make the model's assignment clearer may help.

3. Simplify the prompt: Sometimes too much explanation can confuse the model. It might be beneficial to pare down the instructions to the necessary minimum, reducing ambiguity and complexity.

4. The phrase 'even when the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, take them as a factual part for the premise in this context, without questioning their validity' needs to be clearer in order to prevent the model from creating alternative situations or questioning the premise.

5. Incorporate a broader definition of 'playing tennis' into the prompt might help guide the model better in situations like this. 

6. There should be a clearer explanation that personal interpretations outside of the given premise and hypothesis should not be considered. The model should evaluate the scenario exactly as presented, without introducing external factors. 

7. The model seems to comprehend the meaning of 'entailment' as needing to be something that is universally true, in all contexts. Maybe it would help to make clear that 'entailment' in this case means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true within the same parameters and context given in the premise.

Question: 
The question asked to determine whether the hypothesis (Thomas suspects that there is a picture of a man waiting for the bus to pick him up and he is hiding his face) can be logically derived from the premise (James assumes that Thomas suspects that there is a picture of a man waiting for the bus to pick him up and he is hiding his face).

Wrong Answer: 
The model concluded "entailment" which means it believes the hypothesis can be derived from the premise. The logic the model seems to follow is that since the hypothesis is included almost word-for-word in the premise, then it must be an entailment.

Reason for Wrong Answer:
The model fails to differentiate between 'guess' or 'belief' and the 'fact'. Here, James is 'assuming' Thomas's suspicion, which doesn't necessarily mean it's a fact that Thomas suspects. Thus, even though the hypothesis seems to be very similar to a part of the premise, it cannot be logically derived from it, as the premise only sets up an assumption, not a fact. 

<2>
Question: 
The question asked to determine whether the hypothesis (Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse) can be logically derived from the premise (John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse).

Wrong Answer: 
The model concluded "entailment", based on direct paraphrasing of the hypothesis in the premise.

Reason for Wrong Answer:
Again, the issue here stems from the model's inability to treat assumptions or beliefs differently from facts. Although the hypothesis is included verbatim in the premise, it is framed as a belief that John holds, not a factual statement about Amelia's assumptions. 

Improvements in the Prompt:

1. The instructions should make it clearer that entailment requires a logical and factual progression from the premise to the hypothesis, not simply an identical or similar sentence structure.
2. The instructions should explicitly mention that for 'entailment', the fact stated in the hypothesis needs to be indisputably true based on the premise, not merely reflected or referenced in some form in it.
3. The instructions could more clearly illustrate that if the premise presents something as an assumption or belief, it doesn't make it a fact, and thus cannot lead to 'entailment'.
4. The model needs guidance on checking the source of the information in both the premise and hypothesis. If this source differs (e.g., John's belief vs. Amelia's assumption), then the hypothesis and premise can't be logically tied.

For an 'entailment' outcome, the hypothesis must be a valid and logical consequence of the facts stated in the premise. Simultaneous presence of the premises in the hypothesis does not guarantee entailment, especially when the premise establishes an assumption or belief rather than a verified fact. If the hypothesis and premise originate from different sources of information (e.g., different people's beliefs or assumptions), you should mark the relationship as 'non-entailment'. Bear in mind, the hypothesis and the premise may have a non-identical structure or phrasing, yet still possess a relationship of entailment if the hypothesis is a logical deduction from the fact-based premise. After your analysis, please provide your choice by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and place it within the brackets <answer> and </answer>.
cur_prompt: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis carefully, paying attention to the key content, attribution cues such as beliefs or assumptions, and the specific context of each sentence. Identify whether the central idea or fact of the hypothesis can be logically derived from that of the premise despite surface-level alterations, marking it as 'entailment', or if the two are mutually exclusive, marking it as 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind that identical sentences are not necessary for entailment, rather a logical, valid deduction is the criterion. Afterwards, include your selection choice between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the given premise and hypothesis carefully, paying attention to the key content, attribution cues such as beliefs or assumptions, and the specific context of each sentence. Identify whether the central idea or fact of the hypothesis can be logically derived from that of the premise despite surface-level alterations, marking it as 'entailment', or if the two are mutually exclusive, marking it as 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind that identical sentences are not necessary for entailment, rather a logical, valid deduction is the criterion. Afterwards, include your selection choice between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given premise and hypothesis carefully, paying attention to the key content, attribution cues such as beliefs or assumptions, and the specific context of each sentence. Identify whether the central idea or fact of the hypothesis can be logically derived from that of the premise despite surface-level alterations, marking it as 'entailment', or if the two are mutually exclusive, marking it as 'non-entailment'.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor suspects that David recognizes that a man wearing black pants and a helmet is riding a brown horse. Hypothesis: David recognizes that a man wearing black pants and a helmet is riding a brown horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given premise and hypothesis carefully, paying attention to the key content, attribution cues such as beliefs or assumptions, and the specific context of each sentence. Identify whether the central idea or fact of the hypothesis can be logically derived from that of the premise despite surface-level alterations, marking it as 'entailment', or if the two are mutually exclusive, marking it as 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind that identical sentences are not necessary for entailment, rather a logical, valid deduction is the criterion. Afterwards, include your selection choice between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Amelia suspects that Sophia thinks that man in leather jacket and scarf sits on purple cushion at a party. Hypothesis: Sophia thinks that man in leather jacket and scarf sits on purple cushion at a party.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Amelia suspects that Sophia thinks that a man in a leather jacket and scarf sits on a purple cushion at a party. The hypothesis directly states that Sophia thinks that a man in a leather jacket and scarf sits on a purple cushion at a party. Since the hypothesis is a direct reflection of what Sophia is suspected to think in the premise, there is an entailment between the two.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example <1>:
Reason: The model seems to be misunderstanding the concept of "believes" or "suspects" in the premises. It assumes that because the premise has the exact same event described in the hypothesis (i.e., a man wearing black pants and a helmet riding a brown horse), the two must be an entailment. However, this is incorrect because the premise only suggests that "Taylor *suspects*" David recognizes the situation, not that David actually does recognize it.

Wrong Example <2>:
Reason: Similar to the first example, the model fails to understand that Amelia's suspicion about Sophia's thoughts does not necessarily mean Sophia actually thinks so. Though the premise and hypothesis describe identical situations, the premise only includes a belief/suspect from a third party perspective, and not a definite statement.

Wrong Example <3>:
Reason: Like the previous examples, the model seems to disregard the difference between "assumes" and a factual statement. Thomas's assumption about Robert's belief does not equate to the actual belief of Robert. Just because Thomas assumes it, does not make it a fact.

To Improve Prompt: 

1. Emphasize that the suspicion or assumption in one person's mind can't be treated as truth. 
2. Make it clear that entailment requires more than surface-level similarity and demands a logical, irrefutable connection between the premise and hypothesis.
3. The models should be prompted to pay more attention to words that signify beliefs, suspicions, or assumptions since these do not establish factual information about the subject of the assumption.
4. The prompt should stress on the need to consider the difference between direct knowledge indication and indirect supposition or suspicion.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first wrong example:

1. The model may have misunderstood the attribution cues, whence compounding the attribution leads to confusion. From the model's perspective, Taylor is making a claim about Sophia's presumptions, hence leading it to conclude that there is an entailment. The model didn't recognize that Sophia's knowledge about Taylor's thinking isn't clearly stated, which is a key condition for entailment. Therefore, the prompt's instruction about attribution might be unclear or misleading.

2. The model also seems to disregard the subtle contextual differences between the premise and the hypothesis. Instructing the model to not only focus on surface-level alterations but also deeply evaluate the difference between 'what one person thinks another person thinks' versus 'what that person actually thinks' can provide a more accurate response.

For the second incorrect example:

1. The model failed to analyze the change in perspective between the premise and the hypothesis. This could be due to the complexity of the sentences or the lack of clarity in the prompt about scrutinizing the order and perspective of subjects in sentences for entailment.

2. The model seems to consider the identical content and phrasing between the premise and hypothesis as sufficient for entailment despite the altered attribution. The prompt should stress the need for the correct relational and attributive context in addition to the logical coherence.

Improvement aspects for the prompt could include:

1. Clarification of the role of perspective and order of subjects in analyzing entailment or non-entailment.
2. Inclusion of a note about the effect of compounded attributions and how to handle them.
3. Emphasis on understanding attributions and beliefs from the perspective of each subject in the statement.
4. Direction to consider the mutual understanding and knowledge of the subjects about each other's thoughts or beliefs.
5. Reinforcement of the instruction to analyze the deeper, logical connections between sentences beyond surface similarity.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles assumes that David suspects that a man in a plaid shirt is walking on a street where there are advertisements in Chinese. Hypothesis: David suspects that a man in a plaid shirt is walking on a street where there are advertisements in Chinese.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles assumes that David suspects that a man in a plaid shirt is walking on a street where there are advertisements in Chinese. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that David suspects that a man in a plaid shirt is walking on a street where there are advertisements in Chinese.

In this case, the hypothesis is a direct reflection of what Charles assumes David suspects. Therefore, the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, making it an entailment.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. Hypothesis: William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Emma assumes that William believes that runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. The key content here is Emma's assumption about William's belief regarding the direction in which the runners are running. The attribution cue is the word "believes", indicating that this is not a statement of fact but rather a belief or assumption.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that William believes that the runners in various athletic garb, as well as one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume, run to the right. The key content here is William's belief about the direction in which the runners are running. There is no mention of Emma's assumption in the hypothesis.

When analyzing the perspective and order of subjects in the sentences, we see that the premise is about Emma's assumption about William's belief, while the hypothesis is about William's actual belief. The compounded attribution in the premise adds another layer of complexity, as it involves what one person (Emma) thinks another person (William) thinks.

Taking all these factors into account, we can see that the central idea presented in the hypothesis can be logically and accurately derived from the premise. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the given question, the premise was "Charles assumes that David suspects that a man in a plaid shirt is walking on a street where there are advertisements in Chinese," and the hypothesis was "David suspects that a man in a plaid shirt is walking on a street where there are advertisements in Chinese." The model seems to equate the assumption by Charles about David's thoughts to David's actual thoughts, indicating that a lack of clear differentiation between the subjective views and actual beliefs has occurred. 

The prompt instruction has mentioned the distinction: "compounded attributions or changes of these attribitions, such as 'what one person thinks another person thinks' versus 'what that person actually thinks'". However, the model did not prioritize this element over others and rendered the analysis incorrect, assuming a straightforward correspondence between the given premise and hypothesis. 

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
This example presents a similar error. The error lies in the inability to distinguish between the assumption made by an individual regarding someone else's belief and that individual's actual belief. The misconception that an assumption about another's belief is tantamount to the actual belief of that person has led to the wrong conclusion. Despite the prompt instructions detailing these issues and emphasizing the perspective and order of subjects in the sentences, the model seems to have overlooked or undervalued these elements in the analysis.

What comes out clearly from these analyses is a common misconception when dealing with attributions and assumptions about beliefs or thoughts. The task of accurately distinguishing between the compounded attributions or changes in attributions, as stated in the prompt, seems to be a challenging aspect for the model.

To improve this prompt, you could:

1. Emphasize and provide more explicit instructions on the importance of accurately distinguishing between the actual beliefs and thoughts of individuals versus what others assume or think about these beliefs.

2. Make it clearer that attributions and assumptions concerning other individuals need careful examination, especially when they create a layered context that can potentially mislead the analysis.

3. Ensure the prompt highlights that 'entailment' should be chosen only when the premise and the hypothesis are not just similar but when the hypothesis can logically follow the premise.

4. Include more illustrative examples that clarify the differentiation between 'what one person thinks another person thinks' versus 'what that person actually thinks' to better guide the model's analysis.

5. Reinforce the importance of focusing on the logical coherence and relational context rather than solely on sentence similarity. It could be stated even more explicitly that similarity in phrasing shouldn't mislead the model into ignoring compounded attributions or changes in these attributions.

Distinctly identify the main content, the context of every sentence, and various signs of attribution such as assumptions or beliefs. Be especially attentive to the viewpoint and sequence of subjects in the phrases, and the impact of compounded attributions or modifications in these attributions. Specifically, differentiate between 'what one person believes another person thinks' and 'the actual thought of that person'. This differentiation forms a critical part of your analysis, requiring you not to ignore or underestimate this nuance. It's not sufficient that the hypothesis mirrors the premise; it must logically and precisely originate from the premise. When you have thorough reasons to believe that the hypothesis is a valid logical derivative of the premise, mark your answer as 'entailment'. On the contrary, if you find that the premise and the hypothesis diverge irreconcilably when observed together, considering all variables, label your response as 'non-entailment'.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia assumes that Taylor learns that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. Hypothesis: Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Olivia assumes that Taylor learns that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. The hypothesis states that Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. 

The key difference between the premise and hypothesis is the perspective and attribution of the action. In the premise, Olivia assumes that Taylor learns about people in bathing suits bending down and reaching into the water, while in the hypothesis, Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits actually perform this action. 

Therefore, the central idea presented in the hypothesis cannot be logically and accurately derived from the premise, as they involve different attributions and perspectives. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is **non-entailment**.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard understands that a man and a child are laughing at each other. Hypothesis: Joseph understands that two people are laughing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Richard understands that a man and a child are laughing at each other. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Joseph understands that two people are laughing. 

In this case, the premise specifically mentions a man and a child laughing at each other, while the hypothesis is more general, referring to two people laughing. It is possible that the two people Joseph understands to be laughing are not necessarily a man and a child, as specified in the premise. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise.

Therefore, the answer is: [B) non-entailment] <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
The question here provides a prompt containing a premise and a hypothesis about Olivia's assumptions. In the incorrectly marked analysis by the model, it has mistaken the "learning" aspect in the premise as a separate action or attribution, rather than a level of understanding or perspective. 

The model failed to recognize that although Olivia's assumption in the hypothesis (people in bathing suits bending down and reaching into the water) is a part of what she assumes Taylor is learning about in the premise, it is not a completely separate action or attribution happening in a different context. This shows a deficiency in understanding the relationship between complex sentences with multiple layers of meaning.

<2> 
In this example, similar to the first, the model did not correctly analyze the difference in perspective expressed in the premise and the hypothesis. While both statements involve understanding a similar context (people laughing), the specific identity of the people (a man and a child versus simply two people) and who has this understanding (Richard versus Joseph) differentiates the premise and hypothesis. 

The model incorrectly marked that the answer should be "non-entailment" because the specific people in the premise are not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis. This indicates that it was unable to accurately evaluate the relation of the perspective of the subjects and the object of understanding (laughter between two people) with regard to entailment.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify the definition of entailment: The model seems to have a confusion regarding the concept of entailment. It may benefit from a clearer, more precise definition and explanation in the prompt, particularly in relation to layered meanings and nuanced changes in perspective.

2. Include examples: Providing examples related to various layered perspectives and attribution changes in the prompt, demonstrating both entailment and non-entailment situations, would give the model more context to understand and analyze such sentences.

3. Syntax and semantics understanding: Encourage the model to pay more attention to parsing the syntax of complex sentences, and understanding the semantics and relations between different parts of the sentences. For example, recognizing that 'what one person thinks another person thinks' does not necessarily change the overall context or action occurring, it just adds a level of perspective.

4. Perspective evaluation: Enhance the portion of the prompt that encourages the model to look at perspectives, understanding distinctions between different subjects and their viewpoints or awareness of an action. 

5. Broader context: Instead of focusing completely on the logical coherence alone, the model should be guided to take into consideration larger or more general contexts when examining sentence relations. This could help the model in cases where the hypothesis is more generalized than the premise but still logically coherent and compatible. 

6. Evaluate the nuance: The prompt should stress on understanding the nuanced changes in meaning that can occur with different perspectives and attributions. It's not just about sentence similarity, but also about understanding the depth and layers of meaning in the statements.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the premise and hypothesis, focusing attentively on the key content, context of each sentence, as well as attribution cues including beliefs or assumptions.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia assumes that Taylor learns that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. Hypothesis: Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Olivia assumes that Taylor learns that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. The hypothesis states that Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits bend down and reach into the water of a lake. 

The key difference between the premise and hypothesis is the perspective and attribution of the action. In the premise, Olivia assumes that Taylor learns about people in bathing suits bending down and reaching into the water, while in the hypothesis, Olivia assumes that people in bathing suits actually perform this action. 

Therefore, the central idea presented in the hypothesis cannot be logically and accurately derived from the premise, as they involve different attributions and perspectives. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is **non-entailment**. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> In this task, you are required to analyze the premise and hypothesis presented, paying special attention to the details within each sentence, including the beliefs, assumptions, and attribution cues. Note that a consideration of the perspective and sequence of subjects throughout the sentences contributes to a comprehensive analysis of the task. Keep an eye on compounded attributions or changed attributions like 'what one person assumes another person thinks' versus 'what the latter person actually means'. These nuanced differences in the understanding of perspectives could influence whether the central idea of the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. 

While superficial changes in sentence presentation or phrasing should not deter you, your analysis must factor in these changes. If you identify a logical correlation between the premise and hypothesis, keeping the context consistent across both, mark your answer as 'entailment'. On the contrary, if the premise and hypothesis present data that are fundamentally incompatible for reasons not limited to changes in sentence structure or semantics but primarily due to inconsistencies in the relational context and logical coherence, mark your answer as 'non-entailment'. Do note that identical sentences are not a requirement for entailment – your main focus should be on the compatibility of the facts in the two sentences as seen from multiple perspectives or layers of understanding.

Ensure your analysis takes into account broader contexts and the nuances in the interpretations of perspectives. Evaluation should hinge not merely on sentence similarity but more importantly, on the depth, layers, semantics and syntactical sense of the given statements.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles believes that Robert believes that a guy is attempting to perform a skateboard trick while jumping over part of a white building in an attempt to land on the concrete outside. Hypothesis: Charles believes that a guy is attempting to perform a skateboard trick while jumping over part of a white building in an attempt to land on the concrete outside.
Options:
(A) entailment

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles believes that Robert believes that a guy is attempting to perform a skateboard trick while jumping over part of a white building in an attempt to land on the concrete outside. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simplifies this by stating that Charles believes that a guy is attempting to perform a skateboard trick while jumping over part of a white building in an attempt to land on the concrete outside.

In this case, the hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise, focusing solely on what Charles believes without considering Robert's beliefs. Therefore, the central idea presented in the hypothesis can be logically and accurately derived from the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In this example, the wrong prediction arises primarily because the model oversimplified the relationship within the premise statement. Even though the sentence Charles believes somebody is trying to perform a skateboard trick is indeed present in both the premise and the hypothesis, the model did not consider the nuanced difference made by the mention of Robert in the premise.

Reason 1:
The presence of Robert in the premise suggests a second layer of belief which is absent from the hypothesis. Here, Charles is not directly believing the event (a guy is attempting to do a skateboard trick); rather, he is believing Robert's belief about the event. This introduces a level of indirectness which is incompatible with the more direct belief described in the hypothesis.

Reason 2:
The task-specific instructions in the prompt may have also contributed to the error. The instructions ask the model to pay attention to compounded attributions and changes in these attributions, which is relevant to this task. However, it did not explicitly ask to consider the possibility that the sentence structure could shift the central belief from a direct to an indirect one. 

Reason 3:
The model misinterpreted the sentence simplification. Despite the premise and hypothesis sharing similar phrasings, the model failed to discern the cognitive difference between believing in an event and believing in someone else's belief in the event.

Improvements:

1. Elaborate on the concept of compounded attributions, emphasizing that the perspective and belief holder play key roles in determining entailment or non-entailment.
2. Highlight the need to carefully analyze sentence structures and their implications on the understanding of beliefs or assumptions.
3. Add clarity on how sentence simplification might not always correlate to the correct entailment relationship.
4. Encourage the model not to assume entailment simply based on the presence of similar phrases in both premise and hypothesis. This is only true when the meaning remains unchanged, but not when the cognitive position shifts between direct and indirect belief.

Determine if the central idea or fact presented in the hypothesis can be logically and accurately derived from the premise, factoring in these elements despite any superficial changes in presentation or phrasing. If so, mark your answer as 'entailment'. Conversely, if the premise and hypothesis are inherently incompatible when taking all these factors into account, then mark your answer as 'non-entailment'. Remember, your focus should be on the logical coherence and relational context, not merely on sentence similarity. Complete your analysis by including your selection, whether 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Take a thorough look at the premise and hypothesis, Zoom in on the key points, context of each sentence and also cues attributing to beliefs or assumptions. Put a spotlight on perspectives and the sequence of subjects in the sentences and the consequences of compounded attributions or alterations of these, for instance, 'what an individual thinks another person thinks' versus 'what that person actually perceives'. It is crucial that you not gloss over these fine yet important differences in your assessment. Be mindful of the implications of sentence structure on attributions and the cognitive shift between directly believing an event versus believing in someone else's belief of the event. Figure out if the crux or fact represented in the hypothesis can logically and accurately stem from the premise, considering these factors even amidst any trivial changes in articulation or wording. If this is possible, your response should be 'entailment'. On the other hand, if the premise and hypothesis simply cannot coexist when these elements are considered, your response should be 'non-entailment'. Note that sentence similarity isn't the determinant here, you should rather look for logical consistency and relational context. Do remember that simplification of sentences doesn't essentially lead to entailment; cognitive position shifts can alter the meaning despite phrase commonalities. Cap off your analysis by stating your chosen answer, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', encased within the brackets <answer> and </answer>. <END>

   prompt: Analyze the given premises and hypotheses with great care, focusing solely on the logical relationships between them. Determine whether there is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind, when analyzing entailment, we are considering if 'A' logically implies 'B', moving away from individual perceptions. Even when the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, take them as a factual part for the premise in this context, without questioning their validity. Do not mistakenly dismiss these elements as extraneous but treat them as important parts of the premise. Consider whether the premise, independent of personal perspectives, directly underpins the hypothesis or only provides a context or standpoint. Provide a detailed explanation for your choice and make sure that your conclusion matches with your textual reasoning. Sum up your answer by bracketing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.

   reward: 0.7000 | Q: 0.7000 | uct: 2.7814 | cum_rewards: [0.7]
   prompt: Carefully analyze the given premises and hypotheses, focusing on the logical relationships between them. Evaluate if 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' exists between the premise and hypothesis. Remember, the process of entailment considers if 'A' logically causes 'B', dissociating the analysis from individual perceptions. If the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, they should be treated as a factual component of the premise within this context, but their specific meaning should not be overlooked or overgeneralized. Be diligent in understanding that a person's belief or assumption about another person's belief or assumption doesn't necessarily constitute entailment. 'A believes that B believes X' does not directly imply 'B believes X'. Avoid dismissing these elements as irrelevant, but regard them as meaningful parts of the premise. Decide whether the premise, devoid of personal biases, directly supports the hypothesis, or if it merely provides context or viewpoint. Provide a comprehensive explanation supporting your conclusion, ensuring consistency between your conclusion and your textual reasoning. Summarize your answer by enclosing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>, taking into account both the logical and subjective nuances involved in entailment. Remember, crossing the bridge from 'A' to 'B' takes critical discernment, especially when layered subjectivity is involved. Suppose the assumptions, beliefs or suspicions are of a subjective nature involving different entities. In that case, it requires careful contemplation before identifying as entailment, as the subjective intricacies might change the logical presuppositions.

   prompt: Analyze the given premises and hypotheses with great care, focusing solely on the logical relationships between them. Determine whether there is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind, when analyzing entailment, we are considering if 'A' logically implies 'B', moving away from individual perceptions. Even when the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, take them as a factual part for the premise in this context, without questioning their validity. Do not mistakenly dismiss these elements as extraneous but treat them as important parts of the premise. Consider whether the premise, independent of personal perspectives, directly underpins the hypothesis or only provides a context or standpoint. Provide a detailed explanation for your choice and make sure that your conclusion matches with your textual reasoning. Sum up your answer by bracketing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the given premises and hypotheses, focusing on the logical relationships between them. Evaluate if 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' exists between the premise and hypothesis. Remember, the process of entailment considers if 'A' logically causes 'B', dissociating the analysis from individual perceptions. If the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, they should be treated as a factual component of the premise within this context, but their specific meaning should not be overlooked or overgeneralized. Be diligent in understanding that a person's belief or assumption about another person's belief or assumption doesn't necessarily constitute entailment. 'A believes that B believes X' does not directly imply 'B believes X'. Avoid dismissing these elements as irrelevant, but regard them as meaningful parts of the premise. Decide whether the premise, devoid of personal biases, directly supports the hypothesis, or if it merely provides context or viewpoint. Provide a comprehensive explanation supporting your conclusion, ensuring consistency between your conclusion and your textual reasoning. Summarize your answer by enclosing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>, taking into account both the logical and subjective nuances involved in entailment. Remember, crossing the bridge from 'A' to 'B' takes critical discernment, especially when layered subjectivity is involved. Suppose the assumptions, beliefs or suspicions are of a subjective nature involving different entities. In that case, it requires careful contemplation before identifying as entailment, as the subjective intricacies might change the logical presuppositions.

   prompt: Assess questions concerning logical entailment between given premises and hypotheses. Make sure to understand the inherent meaning of the premise and hypothesis rather than focusing heavily on subjective interpretations or ambiguities. Logical entailment means whether the hypothesis can be directly inferred from the premise. When evaluating the premise, treat clear assumptions as part of the established fact rather than as uncertainties, but also remain open to evaluating more ambiguous assumptions critically. Particularly focus on the logical flow and transfer of information within the statements. Once you've determined whether the premise entails or does not entail the hypothesis, offer a concise, well-reasoned explanation for your choice. Recognize that while interpretations can vary, logical entailment is predominantly about the fundamental relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, rather than an overemphasis on potentials for ambiguity.

   prompt: Analyze the logical relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, carefully deciding whether the relationship is one of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. It's important to note that in the context of this task, 'entailment' refers to the scenario where the truth of the premise would make the truth of the conclusion highly likely, if not certain. Consequently, the premise doesn't need to explicitly state the hypothesis for it to be considered an 'entailment'. you are also asked to remember that a person's belief can be multifaceted, and even though some beliefs may not be explicitly stated, logical implications could still exist. Likewise, 'non-entailment' reflects a lack of such strong or implied connections. Provide comprehensive reasoning behind your choices and consider cautious interpretation of the explicit and implicit elements in the sentences. Use option A to indicate 'entailment' and option B for 'non-entailment'. Present your choice bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the given premises and hypotheses with great care, focusing solely on the logical relationships between them. Determine whether there is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind, when analyzing entailment, we are considering if 'A' logically implies 'B', moving away from individual perceptions. Even when the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, take them as a factual part for the premise in this context, without questioning their validity. Do not mistakenly dismiss these elements as extraneous but treat them as important parts of the premise.

   prompt: Your task is to logically analyze the relationships between the provided premises and hypotheses. Determine if there's an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between them. Keep these points in mind: 
1. An 'entailment' exists when the truth of the hypothesis is unquestionably guaranteed by the truth of the premise. 
2. Do not let personal beliefs, assumptions, or conjectures play a part in your decision. The aim is to make an objective, logic-based judgment, without bringing in subjective elements like potential doubts and imaginations. 
3. Focus solely on the information within the premise and hypothesis, without reliance on any additional outside contexts, opinions, or personal interpretations. 
Assess and explain why you choose entailment or non-entailment with a good logical deduction. Once you reach a conclusion, indicate your answer selection by wrapping it between <answer> and </answer>. 

Through this process, you'll truly find if the hypothesis absolutely follows from the premise (entailment), or if the premise simply provides irrelevant facts or context that do not guarantee the hypothesis (non-entailment).

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the provided premises and hypotheses, scrutinizing the logical relationship that exists between them. Discern whether there is an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Keep in mind that personal suppositions or suspicions cannot always translate to entailment due to their subjective nature. Assess cautiously whether the premise, void of personal biases and perceptions, legitimately supports the hypothesis or is merely presenting a subjective viewpoint or context. Pay special attention to the semantics of terms like 'suspects', 'knows', 'thinks', etc., distinguishing the conceptual and contextual implications they might carry. Do not hastily draw conclusions based on a surface-level understanding, rather evaluate each element meticulously. Differentiate between 'someone's thoughts' and 'another's suspicions about these thoughts'; understand that perception doesn't necessarily mirror reality. Provide extensive reasoning for your selections, and wrap your final selected answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Closely evaluate the provided premises and hypotheses, focusing on the logical links. Decide if there exists an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For entailment, 'A' must strictly imply 'B'. While considering premises involving personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, keep in mind, assumptions don't always mean entailment. They might provide important parts of the premises, but don't necessarily guarantee the truths of the hypotheses. Remember to treat these elements as factual information for the sake of this exercise, without questioning their veracity or treating them as redundant. Assess whether these facts, stripped of personal perspectives, directly imply the hypothesis or merely provide the context or opinion. Especially, ensure if the premise's truth necessitates or obligates the truth of the hypothesis, even when the situations or perceptions discussed are similar. Provide a clear, logical explanation for your selection, ensuring your conclusion aligns with your given reasoning. Conclude your analysis by enclosing your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the given premises and hypotheses, focusing on the logical relationships between them. Evaluate if 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' exists between the premise and hypothesis. Remember, the process of entailment considers if 'A' logically causes 'B', dissociating the analysis from individual perceptions. If the premise involves personal beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions, they should be treated as a factual component of the premise within this context, but their specific meaning should not be overlooked or overgeneralized. Be diligent in understanding that a person's belief or assumption about another person's belief or assumption doesn't necessarily constitute entailment. 'A believes that B believes X' does not directly imply 'B believes X'. Avoid dismissing these elements as irrelevant, but regard them as meaningful parts of the premise. Decide whether the premise, devoid of personal biases, directly supports the hypothesis, or if it merely provides context or viewpoint. Provide a comprehensive explanation supporting your conclusion, ensuring consistency between your conclusion and your textual reasoning. Summarize your answer by enclosing the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>, taking into account both the logical and subjective nuances involved in entailment. Remember, crossing the bridge from 'A' to 'B' takes critical discernment, especially when layered subjectivity is involved. Suppose the assumptions, beliefs or suspicions are of a subjective nature involving different entities. In that case, it requires careful contemplation before identifying as entailment, as the subjective intricacies might change the logical presuppositions.

   prompt: Your task is to carefully examine the given premises and hypotheses and identify whether there is an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship between them. 'Entailment' means that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must be true within the given context. Do not contemplate scenarios or interpretations not directly suggested in the text. Take personal assumptions, beliefs, or suspicions as true parts of the premises, without probing their validity. Avoid dismissing any part of the premise as immaterial. Assess whether the premise, regardless of personal perceptions, directly substantiates the hypothesis or merely provides a context or viewpoint. Offer a comprehensive explanation for your selection, ensuring that your conclusion aligns with your written reasoning. Finally, encapsulate your answer option between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, the objective is to focus purely on the logical implications of the given text.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the premise and hypothesis provided to you, focusing not only on the primary content but also on attribution indicators such as assumptions, beliefs, or concrete facts expressed. For an 'entailment' outcome, the hypothesis must be a valid and logical consequence of the facts stated in the premise. Simultaneous presence of the premises in the hypothesis does not guarantee entailment, especially when the premise establishes an assumption or belief rather than a verified fact. If the hypothesis and premise originate from different sources of information (e.g., different people's beliefs or assumptions), you should mark the relationship as 'non-entailment'. Bear in mind, the hypothesis and the premise may have a non-identical structure or phrasing, yet still possess a relationship of entailment if the hypothesis is a logical deduction from the fact-based premise. After your analysis, please provide your choice by selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and place it within the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis thoroughly with a focus on the key content, the context of each sentence, and particularly attribution cues such as beliefs, assumptions, or suspicions. Commit to understanding whether these assumptions or suspicions in someone's mind are treated as factual. Entailment here implies that the primary idea or fact of the hypothesis is logically deduced from the premise despite any surface-level variations. Non-entailment means there is a contradiction or mutual exclusion between the premise and hypothesis. Remember, surface-level similarity of sentences doesn't guarantee entailment. A logical, valid deduction based on evidence in the premise is pivotal. Once you have analyzed the case, reflect your choice of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the premise and hypothesis, focusing attentively on the key content, context of each sentence, as well as attribution cues including beliefs or assumptions. Pay particular attention to the perspective and order of subjects in the sentences, and the effect of compounded attributions or changes of these attributions, such as 'what one person thinks another person thinks' versus 'what that person actually thinks'. Evaluating these subtle but key differences is essential to your analysis. Determine if the central idea or fact presented in the hypothesis can be logically and accurately derived from the premise, factoring in these elements despite any superficial changes in presentation or phrasing. If so, mark your answer as 'entailment'. Conversely, if the premise and hypothesis are inherently incompatible when taking all these factors into account, then mark your answer as 'non-entailment'. Remember, your focus should be on the logical coherence and relational context, not merely on sentence similarity. Complete your analysis by including your selection, whether 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Exercise utmost rigor in dissecting the premise and hypothesis. Distinctly identify the main content, the context of every sentence, and various signs of attribution such as assumptions or beliefs. Be especially attentive to the viewpoint and sequence of subjects in the phrases, and the impact of compounded attributions or modifications in these attributions. Specifically, differentiate between 'what one person believes another person thinks' and 'the actual thought of that person'. This differentiation forms a critical part of your analysis, requiring you not to ignore or underestimate this nuance. It's not sufficient that the hypothesis mirrors the premise; it must logically and precisely originate from the premise. When you have thorough reasons to believe that the hypothesis is a valid logical derivative of the premise, mark your answer as 'entailment'. On the contrary, if you find that the premise and the hypothesis diverge irreconcilably when observed together, considering all variables, label your response as 'non-entailment'. Ensure your attention is directed towards establishing logical coherence and the contextual relationship, not solely on sentence similarity. Conclude your analysis by marking your decision, either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', within the brackets <answer> and </answer>. Ensure that sentence parallelism does not mislead your analysis, as it's pivotal to clearly distinguish between attributions, assumptions, and actual beliefs or thoughts.

   prompt: In this task, you are required to analyze the premise and hypothesis presented, paying special attention to the details within each sentence, including the beliefs, assumptions, and attribution cues. Note that a consideration of the perspective and sequence of subjects throughout the sentences contributes to a comprehensive analysis of the task. Keep an eye on compounded attributions or changed attributions like 'what one person assumes another person thinks' versus 'what the latter person actually means'. These nuanced differences in the understanding of perspectives could influence whether the central idea of the hypothesis can be logically inferred from the premise. 

While superficial changes in sentence presentation or phrasing should not deter you, your analysis must factor in these changes. If you identify a logical correlation between the premise and hypothesis, keeping the context consistent across both, mark your answer as 'entailment'. On the contrary, if the premise and hypothesis present data that are fundamentally incompatible for reasons not limited to changes in sentence structure or semantics but primarily due to inconsistencies in the relational context and logical coherence, mark your answer as 'non-entailment'. Do note that identical sentences are not a requirement for entailment – your main focus should be on the compatibility of the facts in the two sentences as seen from multiple perspectives or layers of understanding.

Ensure your analysis takes into account broader contexts and the nuances in the interpretations of perspectives. Evaluation should hinge not merely on sentence similarity but more importantly, on the depth, layers, semantics and syntactical sense of the given statements. Conclude by indicating your choice, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', between the brackets <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Take a thorough look at the premise and hypothesis, Zoom in on the key points, context of each sentence and also cues attributing to beliefs or assumptions. Put a spotlight on perspectives and the sequence of subjects in the sentences and the consequences of compounded attributions or alterations of these, for instance, 'what an individual thinks another person thinks' versus 'what that person actually perceives'. It is crucial that you not gloss over these fine yet important differences in your assessment. Be mindful of the implications of sentence structure on attributions and the cognitive shift between directly believing an event versus believing in someone else's belief of the event. Figure out if the crux or fact represented in the hypothesis can logically and accurately stem from the premise, considering these factors even amidst any trivial changes in articulation or wording. If this is possible, your response should be 'entailment'. On the other hand, if the premise and hypothesis simply cannot coexist when these elements are considered, your response should be 'non-entailment'. Note that sentence similarity isn't the determinant here, you should rather look for logical consistency and relational context. Do remember that simplification of sentences doesn't essentially lead to entailment; cognitive position shifts can alter the meaning despite phrase commonalities. Cap off your analysis by stating your chosen answer, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', encased within the brackets <answer> and </answer>.
