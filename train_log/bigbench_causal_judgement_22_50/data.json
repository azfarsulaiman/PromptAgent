Accurately determine if a single action directly led to a result or if multiple variables contributed. Evaluate the contribution of all parties involved, their actions, order of events, and their alignment or deviation from established policies. Clearly differentiate between 'and' and 'or' conditions in determining causation, where 'and' implies that all conditions must be met and 'or' implies that any single condition can lead to the outcome. In scenarios where multiple actions result in the same outcome, give equal weightage to each action. Be mindful to scrutinize conditionals carefully to avoid mistakenly attributing causation when conditions have already been fulfilled by other events. Additionally, give importance to actions that defy standard rules or policies as they often play key roles in the causality.
