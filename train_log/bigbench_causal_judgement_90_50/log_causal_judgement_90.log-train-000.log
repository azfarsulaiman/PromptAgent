Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Eugene and Tina were a young married couple who lived in the country. Both were partially paralyzed and confined to wheelchairs. They had met four years before when Tina was a counsellor with the Canadian Paraplegic Association, had fallen in love, and were married one year later. On this particular evening, Eugene had phoned to request a cab to take them downtown. When the taxi driver arrived, Eugene and Tina were waiting by the street. On seeing that they were both in wheelchairs, the taxi driver refused their fare because he thought it would be too crowded in the taxi with both of them and the wheelchairs. So the taxi driver headed back downtown without them. Because there was no time to call another cab, Eugene and Tina took Tina's car, which was equipped with special hand controls. In order to get downtown from their house, they had to travel across a bridge over Rupert River. A severe storm the night before had weakened the structure of the bridge. About 5 minutes before Eugene and Tina reached it, a section of the bridge collapsed. The taxi driver had reached the bridge about 15 minutes before them, and made it safely across. In the dark, Eugene and Tina drove off the collapsed bridge and their car plummeted into the river below. They both drowned. Their bodies were retrieved from the car the next morning. Did the taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina cause their death?

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instruction: "I only bought and used the chemical A X200R which I had funneled into the blue can." Benni suddenly is startled and says to Alex: "What? You funneled A X200R into the blue can? But you told me you had funneled it into the green can! That's why I always used the green can!" Alex replies: "Did I? Then I am sorry!" Tom remembers that he had filled B Y33R in a green can - long before he had read about the chemicals in his magazine. He had never used it. So Benni must have accidentally, without knowing it, applied the chemical B Y33R, whereas only Alex applied A X200R. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did the fertilization by Benni cause the plant to dry out?

(A) Yes
(B) No

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The failure in this example potentially lies in the complexity and abstract level of causality in the scenario. The artificial intelligence model seems to misunderstand that even though the taxi driver isn't directly responsible for the accident, his action of refusal did set in motion the series of events leading to Eugene and Tina's death, thus can be considered a cause. This could mean the model isn't grasping the intricate layers of causality in real-life scenarios or conversations.

Wrong Example 2:
In the second example, the model is incorrect because it fails to understand the role of the red wire in causing the short circuit only when combined with the black wire, highlighting a deficiency in the model's comprehension of the interplay of causes leading to an effect.

Wrong Example 3:
The failure in this example stems from the model's inability to comprehend complex scenarios accurately, particularly where indirect causation is involved. Benni's mistake led to plants being exposed to two different types of fertilizer, leading them to dry out. The model fails to detect the indirect cause, further indicating a difficulty in grappling with multi-event causal attribution.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Context Understanding: The model should have insight into real-life situations and their causal attributions. It should extrapolate the premises and understand the entire context.

2. Multilayered Causal Attribution: The model should be able to detect indirect cause-and-effect relationships. It should understand multiple events can lead to an outcome, so improving this capability can enhance the model's understanding and response accuracy.

3. Counterfactual Reasoning: The model needs to understand counterfactuals â€“ the consideration of what could have happened if the events had taken a different turn.

4. Nuanced Reasoning: The prompt could guide AI to pay attention not only to the direct cause but also to any auxiliary or intermediate factors that may have played a crucial role in the final outcome. 

5. Emphasizing Answer Justification: Redesigning the prompt in a way that encourages the model to also provide a rationale for its answer choice could help improve its internal reasoning process, thus making its answers more accurate.

6. More Compound Causality Examples: Chain of events leading to an effect should be learned by the model.

Hence, an improved prompt might look something like: "Evaluate the following scenarios carefully to decipher both direct and indirect causation. Provide possible explanations for your answer choice."

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet could possibly hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

gradient:
<1> 
The model misinterpreted the ethics related to causal attribution, thereby misunderstanding that the hunter's decision to shoot the deer while knowing the risk for bird watchers is not equivalent to his intentional act of shooting the birdwatcher. It seems that the model failed to differentiate between causal responsibility and intent, which are ethically and legally distinguished concepts.
 
<2> 
The question tests the understanding of causal attribution in a more complex logical scenario. The model failed to comprehend that the guitar was able to play through the amplifier either because of the amplifier set to Channel A or the power mixer being turned on. The model perhaps overlooked the logical OR connection which asserts that having one or both conditions true would make the statement true, and answered incorrectly.

<3> 
The question involves a causal attribution regarding a garden scenario where two causative variables are at play. The model couldn't infer that Benni's unauthorized usage of a second chemical resulted in plant damages, thereby failing to accurately attribute responsibility.

<4> 
The model wrongly interpreted the causal relationship in this scenario by not acknowledging Bill's role in acquiring the matched set of bookends. Bill's act of stealing the right-side bookend paired with Sue's purchase of the left-side bookend together resulted in the paired set of bookends. However, the model seems to overlook Bill's contribution leading to a wrong response.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Request an assessment of intent: The prompt should direct the model to not only consider questions of causality but also questions of intention when assessing human actions.

2. Clarify complex logical scenarios: The prompt should instruct the model to pay particular attention to logical connectors (like "and", "or") as these affect the understanding of causal attribution.

3. Request clearer distinction between variables: The prompt should instruct the model to diligently distinguish between different variables in an event to accurately establish causality.

4. Emphasize process over result: The prompt should instruct the model to focus more on the involvement of each participant in the process leading to the outcome, rather than just the final result.

Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
The model misinterpreted the ethics related to causal attribution, thereby misunderstanding that the hunter's decision to shoot the deer while knowing the risk for bird watchers is not equivalent to his intentional act of shooting the birdwatcher. It seems that the model failed to differentiate between causal responsibility and intent, which are ethically and legally distinguished concepts.
 
<2> 
The question tests the understanding of causal attribution in a more complex logical scenario. The model failed to comprehend that the guitar was able to play through the amplifier either because of the amplifier set to Channel A or the power mixer being turned on. The model perhaps overlooked the logical OR connection which asserts that having one or both conditions true would make the statement true, and answered incorrectly.

<3> 
The question involves a causal attribution regarding a garden scenario where two causative variables are at play. The model couldn't infer that Benni's unauthorized usage of a second chemical resulted in plant damages, thereby failing to accurately attribute responsibility.

<4> 
The model wrongly interpreted the causal relationship in this scenario by not acknowledging Bill's role in acquiring the matched set of bookends. Bill's act of stealing the right-side bookend paired with Sue's purchase of the left-side bookend together resulted in the paired set of bookends. However, the model seems to overlook Bill's contribution leading to a wrong response.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Request an assessment of intent: The prompt should direct the model to not only consider questions of causality but also questions of intention when assessing human actions.

2. Clarify complex logical scenarios: The prompt should instruct the model to pay particular attention to logical connectors (like "and", "or") as these affect the understanding of causal attribution.

3. Request clearer distinction between variables: The prompt should instruct the model to diligently distinguish between different variables in an event to accurately establish causality.

4. Emphasize process over result: The prompt should instruct the model to focus more on the involvement of each participant in the process leading to the outcome, rather than just the final result.

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this example, the prompt seems to be guiding the model to assume that the occurrence of the final event (making a layup) was the cause for the bet winning without considering the alternative conditions that could have led to the win, namely, the first event (making a 3-point shot). This shows that the model is interpreting the causal attribution in a linear manner, overlooking the possibility of multiple causal factors.

<2> Similar to the previous example, the model overly focuses on the presence of the black wire touching the battery as a causative factor for the short circuit without considering the conditionality involved. The machine may only short circuit if both wires touch the battery, but the model failed to take this into account.

<3> The model once again misunderstood the causative sensitivity to different conditions. The boat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. The gear was already in neutral before Ned changed the position of the motor, hence the motor change was not the cause of the starting of the boat.

Reasons driving the misinterpretations:
1. Overlooking Multiple Causes: The model lacks sensitivity to multiple factors that can contribute to an event, simply attributing the result to the latest or apparent factor. 
2. Misinterpretation of Conditional Statements: It appears the model struggles to correctly interpret conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect.
3. Linear Causal Attribution: The model seems to overly associate causes with the most recent or final event, without considering other possible contributing factors.

Potential improvements for the prompt:
1. Clearly specify that the task may involve situations where multiple factors can causally contribute to an end event.
2. Emphasize the importance of understanding and interpreting conditional statements correctly when it comes to determining cause and effect.
3. Add an instruction to the prompt reminding the model to not always associate causation with the most recent or final event. It must consider all stages/events before making a causal attribution.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is not on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it's not. So, he changes the position of the device, and he puts it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM.

gradient:
The language model's error in this example seems to stem from a misunderstanding of the causality in the scenario described. The device needs both to be plugged in and placed on the charging pad to be fully charged in an hour. Since Wayne's action of moving the device onto the charging pad is the second condition for the device to be charged, Wayneâ€™s action indeed caused the device to charge fully.

Reasons for the error:
1. Ambiguity in interpretation: The prompt asks the model to take into account all stages/events before determining causality. But it seems that the model might be stuck on considering only the immediately preceding event (charging pad alone) as the cause, and neglecting the importance of an earlier event (plugging in the device).

2. Insufficient focus on temporal sequence: The prompt doesn't adequately stress the significance of the temporal sequence in causal events, which is key in this scenario. Wayneâ€™s action of putting the device on the charging pad, which came last, is important in attributing causality.

3. Ignoring multi-factor conditions: Despite the prompt's direction to consider multiple factors contributing to an event, the model seems to neglect that the charging of the device is dependent on both conditions: being plugged in and put on the charging pad.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Add explicit instruction that the model should consider the temporal order of events when assigning causality. For instance, later actions can be crucial in multi-condition scenarios.
2. Emphasize the need to account for and interpret multi-condition and multi-step scenarios correctly. The model should understand when an event is contingent on multiple factors all being fulfilled.
3. Strengthen instruction that the model should avoid attributing causality solely to the most recent event. In this example, the recent position shift of the device onto the charging pad is crucial, contradicting the guideline to avoid such a focus.
4. Suggest the importance of considering the context and specifics of each situation rather than applying general rules of causal attribution. Different scenarios require different interpretations of cause and effect.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Example:
In the provided example, the model selected option A, which inferred that David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature settings. The correct answer is B, as the clothes would have dried within sixty minutes regardless of David changing the settings due to the condition that clothes dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH and the cycle was already set to MAX DRY. 

Reason for incorrect answer:
    The prompt may not have made the multiple cause factors clear enough, leading the model to focus solely on the action performed by David and not considering the pre-existing conditions. The prompt requires the model to treat conditional statements as individual causes instead of understanding them as a system with dependencies, leading to simplification of causation.

Improvements for the prompt:
    The prompt needs to explicitly instruct the model to consider the order of the events and dependencies in a more pronounced way. The language for considering all stages/events before determining causality needs to be clear that it includes preconditions and actions that occur before the triggering event. Additionally, the model should also evaluate conditionals as chains of events where some conditions may already be satisfied before an additional action is taken.

2. Example:
If a similar case were to happen, where an initial condition is already met prior to an action taken, the model will still likely focus on the last action as the direct cause of the event. 
    
Reason for incorrect answer:
    Since the model focuses on the final event as the determining cause, it overlooks that the condition for the event is already met before the action is taken.

Improvements for the prompt:
    The phrase "Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause" should be highlighted and elaborated further for the model to put more weight into it. The model should be instructed to consider if the final action changes the outcome or if it was already determined before the action was taken.

In summary, the prompt could be improved by:
1. Reinforcing the emphasis on dependencies and existing conditions in a system more explicitly. 
2. Updating the language to instruct the model to place more weight on the order of conditions and events.
3. Defining more clearly that all stages/events concept includes pre-existing conditions.
4. Highlighting and elaborating on the direction not to always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause.

<START> When attempting to answer questions about causal attribution, bear the following principles in mind. Be diligent in considering a comprehensive list of factors that might contribute to an event. This includes not only the final or last observable action, but also previously established conditions and preliminary events. If conditional statements are presented, understand their logical structure and all their implications. Be aware that these conditionals often operate as a chain of dependent events where some conditions might already be satisfied before an additional action takes place. Evaluate every event chronologically and cumulatively before settling on the cause, because an effect is often the sum of all its precedent causes, not just the final or most visible one. Thus, avoid attaching excessive influence to the latest or final event as the primary cause; it might be a contributing factor, but not a pivotal, determining one especially if the outcome was already predestined by prior conditions. Finally, bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer> to indicate your decision. Remember, causality is not simplistic, it's a complex interaction of dependencies that requires you to thoughtfully understand and interpret conditions when attributing cause. <END>

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by focusing on the immediate event of Alice logging in while Zoe was already logged in, and conclude that Alice caused the empty email to be sent. However, a more thorough analysis would consider the policy violation by Zoe as a contributing factor, as well as the underlying system issue that triggers the email when two people are logged in simultaneously. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model answered incorrectly because it neglected to focus on the intention of Bob the henchman. The prompt emphasizes considering multiple factors, causality and dependencies, which the model seems to have interpreted broadly without focusing on the intentionality of the action. Bob did cause harm to the townspeople but he did not intend to cause harm, his intention was to rob the bank.

<2> 
Similar to the first example, the model neglects the emphasis on intentionality. Despite the hunter knowing his action would cause the eagle to fly away, his intention was to win the competition, not to cause the eagle to fly away. The model interprets the outcome of the action as proof of intentional causality, which is incorrect in this scenario.

<3> 
The model erred again by overlooking the intentionality behind the board's decision. Although the decision did benefit the environment, there was no explicit intention to do so. The model seems to have assigned cause and effect broadly without proper interpretation of intentions and the interplay of factors leading to the outcome.

<4> 
The model has wrongly focused on the final event as the sole cause of the event, contrary to the advice in the prompt. While Alice did login while Zoe was already logged in, it was originally Zoe's violation of the policy that started the chain of events leading to the email being sent. Consideration of the underlying system issue and the sequence of events can provide a more nuanced attribution of cause.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize the importance of intentionality behind actions when determining cause and effect. The word 'intentionally' is very critical in these examples and should be given high priority when inferring causality.
2. Reinforce the need to consider sequence of events and dependencies more thoroughly.
3. Highlight that a cause does not always equate to intentional action.
4. Encourage the model to analyze conditional statements more carefully to understand the motivation behind actions.
5. The prompt should be improved to direct the model to not just focus on the outcome, but take into consideration all the stages/events leading up to it.

Despite the hunter knowing his action would cause the eagle to fly away, his intention was to win the competition, not to cause the eagle to fly away. The model interprets the outcome of the action as proof of intentional causality, which is incorrect in this scenario.

<3> 
The model erred again by overlooking the intentionality behind the board's decision. Although the decision did benefit the environment, there was no explicit intention to do so. The model seems to have assigned cause and effect broadly without proper interpretation of intentions and the interplay of factors leading to the outcome.

<4> 
The model has wrongly focused on the final event as the sole cause of the event, contrary to the advice in the prompt. While Alice did login while Zoe was already logged in, it was originally Zoe's violation of the policy that started the chain of events leading to the email being sent. Consideration of the underlying system issue and the sequence of events can provide a more nuanced attribution of cause.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize the importance of intentionality behind actions when determining cause and effect. The word 'intentionally' is very critical in these examples and should be given high priority when inferring causality.
2. Reinforce the need to consider sequence of events and dependencies more thoroughly.
3. Highlight that a cause does not always equate to intentional action.
4. Encourage the model to analyze conditional statements more carefully to understand the motivation behind actions.
5. The prompt should be improved to direct the model to not just focus on the outcome, but take into consideration all the stages/events leading up to it.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is off. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's off. So, he changes the position of knob A to the on position. Because the building will implode if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom changed the position of knob A?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is:

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Examining the question, the hedgehog did contribute to the problem, even though it was unaware of the rules. The language model, however, opted for answer B (No), which is incorrect as it failed to consider all the factors and sequences of events. A major issue here is that the model might have concluded that the hedgehog's lack of knowledge about the rule minimizes its causal role, whereas, in reality, the outcome (the missing pencils) occurred irrespective of its knowledge.

The language model also seems to approach the problem strictly from an intentional action standpoint, thereby failing to consider unintentional outcomes. In the setting of causal attribution, the language model should not solely focus on intentionality but should also take into account actions that lead to unintentional consequences.

Prompt Improvement: Emphasize that both intentional and unintentional actions can potentially lead to a certain outcome and this should be considered when responding. Clarify in the prompt that an unawareness of the rules does not lessen the causal impact.

Example 2:

In this scenario, the language model incorrectly assigns the cause of the building's implosion to Tom's action of turning on knob A, disregarding that the building would have imploded at the same time even if knob A had remained in the off position. This misconception occurs because the model may have associated the last action (Tom switching on knob A) as the cause, which goes against the instruction in the prompt not to isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause. 

The model also misses the conditional nature of the implosion, which would have happened with either condition being met (the safety switch being off or knob A being on). This inability to interpret the conditions correctly may be due to the complexity of the dependencies involved.

Prompt Improvement: Ensure to stress the importance of taking into account all contributing actions and sequence of events. Clearly communicate the need to correctly interpret conditions when attributing cause and effect, especially in scenarios where multiple conditions could lead to the same outcome.

The language model likely misinterpreted the causality in this example. The phrasing of the prompt might have led the model to consider the coin flip as a necessary factor in the occurrence of the event (Alex winning). While it is true that the coin flip was one of the conditions, the fact that a dice roll greater than 11 was required as well seems to have been overlooked. This might be because the prompt emphasizes the interpretations of conditions too heavily, leading the model to overestimate the significance of the coin flip event and undermining the importance of the dice roll.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Suzy and Billy are working on a project. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Correct Answer: (A) Yes

This error might have occurred because the prompt failed to emphasize the concept of shared causality. The model may have viewed Billy and Suzy as incapable of both being causative factors for the motion detector's activation. The guidance on considering multiple potential causes might actually have led the model to discount Billy as a cause, as Suzy also stepped into the room at the same time.

Improvements:

1. Emphasize the concept of joint causality: The prompt should include language emphasizing that multiple individuals or events can contribute to an outcome; joint causality should be acknowledged and not undermined.
2. Distinguish between necessary and sufficient causes: The prompt could better signal the importance of distinguishing between causes that are necessary and those that are sufficient. In the first example, the coin flip was necessary but not sufficient for Alex to win. Therefore, it was not the sole cause of Alex's win.
3. Common sense reasoning: Encourage the model to use common sense reasoning in evaluating possible cause-and-effect relationships. For instance, the fact that both dice roll and coin flip were needed for Alex to win should be carefully considered.
4. Perception of simultaneous events: Include a clearer instruction for the model to more accurately consider and dissect simultaneous events.
5. Causality in conditioned events: Prompt the model to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. In the second example, both Suzy and Billy were capable of causing the motion detector to go off.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?

The new prompts is:
response:
<START>When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event. Thus, careful analysis of conditional statements is integral to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. Remember, a cause is not always the result of an intentional action.

Lastly, express your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>, carefully representing your causal attribution analysis in a clear, condensed form. Be open to complex causal relationships and make full use of common sense reasoning in your deliberations. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Janet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question entails that both Billy and Suzy working simultaneously on the central computer led to the deletion of spam emails containing viruses. Here, the causation can be attributed to both individuals, since the action required the simultaneous presence of both. However, the model wrongly attributed the cause solely to Billy, thereby misunderstanding the collective effect Billy and Suzy's actions had on the outcome.

Detailed Step-by-step Analysis:
- It misinterprets the prompt's emphasis on 'conditional statements', ignoring that Billy and Suzy's simultaneous presence acted as a condition to trigger the deletion.
- It also fails to understand that the causation occurred due to a combination of actions, not the intentional action of a single individual.
- It ignores the direct relation between the simultaneous login of Billy and Suzy and the deletion of spam emails.

<2> 
The question implies that Kate's inaction - not putting oil in the machine when she noticed Janet's omission - indirectly caused the machine to break down. The model, however, incorrectly interprets Kate's inaction as irrelevant, focusing instead on Janet's responsibility and neglecting Kate's knowledge of what could happen without the oil.

Detailed Step-by-step Analysis: 
- It misses the acknowledgement of 'intentionality', underplaying Kate's decision not to oil the machine despite knowing the consequences.
- It overlooks the dependency of the machine's functioning on oiling, as indicated in the question.
- It misconstrues the prompt's guidance about differentiating consequences of 'unintentional outcomes' and 'intentional actions', focusing too much on job roles and responsibilities.

Based on the above, the following improvements could be made to the prompt:
- Emphasize the understanding of the collective effect of actions or inactions on the outcome.
- Stress building a complete understanding of the scenario and all known factors irrespective of explicit responsibilities.
- Reinforce the attention to indirect causes and the effects of inaction where competence is present.
- Stress the importance of the dependency of actions or inactions on the result, even when the causation seems obscure.
- Encourage recognition of indirect causation as a valid and significant form of causation.
- Implore rigorous, comprehensive, and discerning analysis of all factors, actions, and conditions involved in the situation.
- Mandate the understanding that though an event may occur post an action, the consequence or outcome may not have been the intended cause of that action.

Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.

response:
<START> When tackling questions about causal attribution, ensure to thoroughly explore all potential factors and antecedents that may have contributed to an event. Delve deeply into each step in the sequence of events, as well as the implications of actions. Always remember that causality often lies in a series of actions and not only in the final conclusion. Therefore, avoid attributing the latest or terminal event as the only cause. Furthermore, investigate all known conditions, dependencies, motivations, and intentions of the actors in question. Particularly important is to acknowledge the potential impact of collective actions or inactions of individuals involved. In the process of your evaluation, remember to differentiate between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions, underlining the fact that causation does not always equate to intent. In the scenario, if there is an action or inaction with known consequences, consider it as a contributing factor. Even though some actions may have unintentional consequences, they may still contribute to the outcome. Finally, when attributing causation, understand that indirect causation is as significant as direct causation. Make sure to include any indirect actions or omissions that contributed to the outcome, and scrutinize the roles of all relevant actors irrespective of formal responsibilities or roles. Always strive for a comprehensive, discerning, and rigorous understanding of all variables, factors, conditions, and personalities involved. When you derive your answer, encapsulate it between <answer> and </answer>. <END>

cur_prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects. Strive to incorporate a holistic view of events and actions. To indicate your answer choice, place it between <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is red, so he is supposed to stop and wait. Suzy's signal is green, so she is supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of collapse. If they both drive their trains onto the bridge at the same time, it will collapse. Neither train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge, but both together will be too heavy for it. Billy decides to ignore his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses. Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is not subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and she sees that she is not. So, she changes her subscription status, and she subscribes to the email list. Because customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list, Laurie receives a free sample.

John is standing near the tracks of a trolley. John notices that the brakes of the trolley have failed. Five workmen are working on the tracks with their backs turned. John sees that the runaway trolley is headed for the five workmen who will be killed if it proceeds on its present course. The only way to save these five workmen is to hit a switch that will turn the trolley onto the side tracks. Unfortunately, there is a single workman on the side tracks with his back turned. John knows that the worker on the side tracks will be killed if he hits the switch, but the five workmen will be saved. John decides to hit the switch. Sure enough, the trolley turns on the side tracks, the five workmen on the main tracks are saved, and the workman on the sidetracks is killed. Did John intentionally cause the death of the workman on the side tracks?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is on. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's on. So, he does not change the position of knob A at all. Because the building would implode if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first example, the model incorrectly denies that Billy caused the bridge to collapse. The model overlooked the fact that while Billy was signaled to stop, he ignored the signal, therefore contributing to the weight overload leading to the bridge's collapse. In this case, the model failed to understand the cause-effect relationship and the import of Billy's violation of traffic signals. The model seems to base causality on intentionality; however, as per the prompt, a cause does not always equate to an intentional act.

Wrong Example 2:

The second example also relies on a proper understanding of cause and effect. The model incorrectly denies that Laurie received the sample because she changed her subscription status. The action of changing her subscription status was essentially the trigger, leading to a sequence of events that resulted in receiving the free sample, thus establishing causality.

Wrong Example 3:

In the third example, the model fails to attribute the death of the workman on the side tracks to John's deliberate action, marking John's action as unintentional. However, John was aware that hitting the switch would lead to the worker's death, making it a direct cause. The model seems to conflate moral judgment with causality.

Wrong Example 4:

In the fourth example, the model fails to recognize Tom's inaction (not changing the knob's position) as a contributing factor to the building's implosion. The state of the knob (on) was one of the conditions required for the implosion. Tom checked the knob, knew it was 'on,' did nothing to change it, thereby allowing the implosion. This demonstrates that the model struggles with understanding the impact of maintaining the status quo in a cause-effect relationship.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify that causality is not always tied to direct action but can be attributed to inaction as well. The model needs to recognize that maintaining a particular condition or intervening to change a condition are both important considerations in causal analysis.

2. Emphasize that the analysis of causation should not be guided by moral judgement. While answering questions about causation, the task is to identify causal outcomes, not to pass moral judgments on the actors' actions.

3. A cause does not always equate to an intentional act. The model has a tendency to ascribe causality solely to intentional acts, so it's critical to reinforce that unintentional acts, ignorance, or misunderstanding can still have causal effects.

4. Reinforce the understanding of conditional and compound conditional statements. The model seems to struggle with questions that involve if-then statements that include conditions that are must-happen conditions for a particular outcome. 

5. The description could benefit from an addition stating that the model should consider the various interpretations possible for the same series of events. In other words, it should not just resort to the most common or simplest interpretation but strive for deeper comprehension that goes beyond face value.
   
6. Reiterate that all relevant actions and events, including both the most recent ones and those that have taken place earlier, can have potential causal implications.

However, John was aware that hitting the switch would lead to the worker's death, making it a direct cause. The model seems to conflate moral judgment with causality.

Wrong Example 4:

In the fourth example, the model fails to recognize Tom's inaction (not changing the knob's position) as a contributing factor to the building's implosion. The state of the knob (on) was one of the conditions required for the implosion. Tom checked the knob, knew it was 'on,' did nothing to change it, thereby allowing the implosion. This demonstrates that the model struggles with understanding the impact of maintaining the status quo in a cause-effect relationship.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify that causality is not always tied to direct action but can be attributed to inaction as well. The model needs to recognize that maintaining a particular condition or intervening to change a condition are both important considerations in causal analysis.

2. Emphasize that the analysis of causation should not be guided by moral judgement. While answering questions about causation, the task is to identify causal outcomes, not to pass moral judgments on the actors' actions.

3. A cause does not always equate to an intentional act. The model has a tendency to ascribe causality solely to intentional acts, so it's critical to reinforce that unintentional acts, ignorance, or misunderstanding can still have causal effects.

4. Reinforce the understanding of conditional and compound conditional statements. The model seems to struggle with questions that involve if-then statements that include conditions that are must-happen conditions for a particular outcome. 

5. The description could benefit from an addition stating that the model should consider the various interpretations possible for the same series of events. In other words, it should not just resort to the most common or simplest interpretation but strive for deeper comprehension that goes beyond face value.
   
6. Reiterate that all relevant actions and events, including both the most recent ones and those that have taken place earlier, can have potential causal implications.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects. Strive to incorporate a holistic view of events and actions. To indicate your answer choice, place it between <answer> and </answer>.

response:
<START> When analyzing questions about causal attribution, prioritize a thorough understanding of the complexity and multifaceted aspects of causality. Ensure you assess each chain of events and actions meticulously, taking care to consider multiple elements that might have influenced the outcome. Don't limit your focus to the final or most recent events; give equal attention to prior events as each has the potential to influence the final result. It's essential to interpret conditional statements correctly, and don't assume that a cause is always the result of an intentional act. Make efforts to derive the intentions and motivations that propelled the actions. It's also important to acknowledge situations where, regardless of intent, a certain action played a significant role in shaping the end result. Remember, unintentional consequences can stem from an individual being unaware or misunderstanding a situation. In these cases, their direct or indirect actions could still have had a major impact on the outcome. Scrutinize the dependencies underlying the events, assess if alternative possibilities could've changed the outcome, and consider the consequence of a specific action not being undertaken. If a certain result would have occurred regardless of a specific action due to another condition being fulfilled, ensure you factor this information accurately into your assessment of causality. Your analysis should reflect a nuanced approach to understanding intentionality, simultaneously factoring in actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional outcomes. Don't be swayed by moral judgments when assigning cause â€“ the task is to objectively determine the factors leading to an outcome. Additionally, be mindful of inaction also being a potential causative factor. While analyzing conditional or compound conditional statements, pay close attention to the conditions that must be met for a particular outcome. Ensure your approach is comprehensive and goes beyond surface value, exploring potential alternative interpretations of the same set of events. Include all relevant events and actions, irrespective of their order in the chain, considering their possible causal implications. Your response should be encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Todd, Anne, Jason, and Steph all share an account for a popular online television streaming service. In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Todd, Anne, and Jason regularly use their account from their laptops on Saturdays. This Saturday, as usual, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Sure enough, since three people logged into the streaming account at the same time, the account was suspended. Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop caused the account to be suspended, we need to consider the sequence of events and the conditions set by the streaming service. The streaming service explicitly stated that the account would be suspended if three people logged in from their laptops at the same time. In this scenario, Todd, Anne, and Jason all logged into the account from their laptops simultaneously, which triggered the suspension.

Therefore, Todd logging into the account from his laptop was a contributing factor to the account being suspended, but it was not the sole cause. The suspension was a result of all three individuals logging in at the same time, as per the service's policy.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that when the bullet travels through the air it will definitely disturb the air molecules around it. But the sniper doesn't care at all about disturbing air molecules, he just wants to shoot his target. So, he pulls the trigger. As the sniper expected, as the bullet travels from his gun into the enemy commander, it disturbed some air molecules. Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did intentionally disturb some air molecules, as he was aware that pulling the trigger would cause this disturbance, even though it was not his primary intention. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

The question was if Todd logging in from his laptop caused the suspension of the account. The model incorrectly says, "(A) Yes" as its answer. The model was confused by the prompt's instructions to evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, causing it to place too much weight on Todd's individual action without adequately considering the broader context. 

The prompt places significant focus on in-depth and multi-faceted causality analysis. While healthy in principle, this approach can lead the model to overcomplicate simpler scenarios where the attribution of causality is straightforward. In this example, Todd's individual action of logging in did not directly lead to the account's suspension; it was the combined action of three people logging in simultaneously. 

Example 2: 

The question was whether the sniper intentionally disturbed some air molecules. The model incorrectly says "(A) Yes" as its answer. This error appears to stem from the prompt's emphasis on noting the intentional and unintentional outcomes of an actor's actions. The model interpreted the sniper's knowledge of disturbing air molecules as intent, even though the sniper's goal was not to disturb air molecules but to shoot the target. 

In this context, the prompt's instruction to "strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind actions" seems to have misled the model. This is because understanding motivations and intentions does not necessarily mean that every foreseeable outcome of an action is intentional.

Improvements for the prompt: 

1. Clarify the definition of 'cause': The model seems to interpret any action contributing to an outcome as a cause, which can lead to inaccuracies. Providing a better definition of 'cause' can help. For instance, an action can be considered a cause if its removal would have prevented the outcome, among other potential considerations.

2. Refine the understanding of intentionality: The prompt should emphasize that not all known outcomes of an action are necessarily intentional. We can clarify that an outcome is only intentional if it was part of the actor's goals.

3. Add guidance on dealing with oversimplification or complication of issues: The model can misinterpret the prompt's instructions to examine sequences of actions and events in depth, leading it to oversimplify or overcomplicate issues. The prompt could emphasize the importance of appropriately matching the complexity of the analysis to the complexity of the scenario.

4. Offer a balanced view focusing on all actors involved: The model should not disproportionately focus on one actor's actions in scenarios involving multiple parties. The prompt could more firmly emphasize this. 

5. Stress the concept of simultaneous conditions: It would be helpful to incorporate more instructions on understanding and analyzing events that need simultaneous conditions to be met. In such cases, no single condition can solely cause the event's occurrence. 

By incorporating these aspects, the prompt will likely render more accurate predictions by the language model.

response:
<START>When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to grasp the complexity and multi-angular nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events thoroughly, taking into account multiple factors. Do not attribute disproportionate weight to the final or latest events; instead, recognize that each event and action involved may influence the outcome. The decoding of conditional statements is vital to properly discern the cause, considering that cause does not always correspond to intentional action. In your analysis, prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions but also acknowledge that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of those intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is deemed intentional only if it aligns with the actor's primary goals.

Understand the role of unintended consequences that arise when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay close attention to dependencies and the potential impact of different scenarios. If an event would have occurred regardless of a certain action due to an existing condition, consider this information when assigning responsibility. The goal is to maintain a balanced view, focusing equally on all actors involved. Avoid oversimplification or overcomplication, matching the level of your analysis to the complexity of the situation.

Your approach should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality, with focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative scenarios, and unforeseeable effects. When multiple conditions need alignment for an event to occur, no single condition should be labelled as the sole cause.

In summary, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions maintaining the balance between the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Place your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> for clarity. <END>

cur_prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the car crash cause Mr. Wallace's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, the car crash did not cause Mr. Wallace's death. The lethal dose of poison found in his blood was the cause of his death. The car crash was a separate event that occurred after the poison had already taken effect. <answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The circuit breaker failed because three people turned on their lamps at the same time, which was the condition for the failure to occur. Jim's action alone did not directly lead to the failure of the circuit breaker. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Prompt Misperceptions: The model seems to have got confused with complex sequences and multiple causal variables. While it correctly identified the presence of poison, it overlooked that the immediate cause of death was the explosion caused by the car crash, and thus, it did not evaluate the sequence of events adequately.

Reason for Error: The current prompt states to consider multiple factors and evaluate the sequences of events precisely. However, it does not explicate to view the proximate cause and ultimate cause differently, which was necessary in this scenario. The model placed more weight on the final act - the ingestion of poison instead of seeing the car crash as a crucial cause leading to Mr. Wallace's immediate death.

Example 2:
Prompt Misperceptions: The model's misinterpretation of the intentionality aspect in the case led to the wrong conclusion. The model incorrectly identified Jake's intention as he was described as an expert marksman, and his shooting was accurately described.

Reason for Error: Here, the model seems to fail in interpreting the statement " a cause does not always equate to an intentional act." The model seems to interpret this as meaning that an act could not be intentional, even when explicitly stated. 

Example 3:
Prompt Misperceptions: The model incorrectly thought that the act of Jim turning on his lamp did not contribute to the circuit breaker's failure. Additionally, it disregarded the fact that even though there were other people involved, the event wouldn't have occurred without Jim's contribution.

Reason for Error: The model struggles to understand that contribution from multiple factors doesn't absolve any single factor of its causal role. While the phenomenon required multiple events to occur together, the model oversimplified by attributing the cause solely to the number of lamps turned on, ignoring the equal causal contribution from each participant.

Improving the prompt:

1. Make it explicit that the model should consider both proximate and distal causes in the event. An earlier event doesn't necessarily mean it's more responsible for the outcome, especially when the later events play a critical part in the outcome.
2. Provide better guidance on interpreting intentionality. Explicitly state that if there's clear evidence of intentionality, it should be considered as such.
3. Reinforce that if an event requires several conditions to happen simultaneously, each one should be considered as having contributed causally.
4. Lastly, remind the model to consider the entirety of the context provided and not oversimplify the situations. The prompt should illustrate that complex situations often present several layers of actions and reactions, all of which must be evaluated.
5. Incorporating a directive for the model to consider the immediacy of an action's effect may also improve its ability to correctly identify causes. It should understand that timing plays a pivotal role in determining causality in particular scenarios.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality.

<START> When responding to questions about causal attribution, understand the complexity and multiple aspects of cause and effect. Evaluate the sequence of events and actions attentively, remembering to incorporate multiple aspects. This should involve not only the final or recent actions but all events, as each could influence the outcome's occurrence. In terms of the interpretation of conditional statements, remember that an event doesn't always correspond to a deliberate act. Therefore, try to identify the motivations and intentions behind the actions, as well as moments where a particular action, regardless of its intended consequences, has influenced the outcome. Especially consider outcomes that arise from an actor's lack of awareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Delve into the implicit dependencies, alternative possibilities, and their influence. If an event would have transpired regardless of a particular action due to the existence of an alternate condition, accurately identify and include this information in the process of assigning causality. In your analysis, differentiate between proximate cause, the last event directly causing the outcome, and distal or ultimate cause which may set a sequence of events in motion. Be aware that every contributing factor holds its weight in a situation where multiple conditions needed to meet for an event to occur. Apply a nuanced comprehension of intentionality, bearing in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintended consequences. A holistic view of events and actions should be your ultimate aim. In case of clear-cut motivation or intention context, regard such clues as evidence of intent. Time and its role should also be considered as immediate consequences may bear more relevance in some contexts. Finally, present your answer choice by enclosing it between the <answer> and </answer> indicators. <END>

cur_prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to grasp the complexity and multi-angular nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events thoroughly, taking into account multiple factors. Do not attribute disproportionate weight to the final or latest events; instead, recognize that each event and action involved may influence the outcome. The decoding of conditional statements is vital to properly discern the cause, considering that cause does not always correspond to intentional action. In your analysis, prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions but also acknowledge that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of those intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is deemed intentional only if it aligns with the actor's primary goals.

Understand the role of unintended consequences that arise when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay close attention to dependencies and the potential impact of different scenarios. If an event would have occurred regardless of a certain action due to an existing condition, consider this information when assigning responsibility. The goal is to maintain a balanced view, focusing equally on all actors involved. Avoid oversimplification or overcomplication, matching the level of your analysis to the complexity of the situation.

Your approach should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality, with focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative scenarios, and unforeseeable effects. When multiple conditions need alignment for an event to occur, no single condition should be labelled as the sole cause.

In summary, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions maintaining the balance between the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Place your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
In a particular building there are two businesses, a travel agency and a graphic design studio. The building's climate control system is a new design that saves energy by keeping track of the number of people in the building, and only turning on when enough people have entered the building. The climate control system will turn on when the people who work at the travel agency or the people who work in the design studio arrive for work. Each office has enough employees to turn on the climate control system on their own. The travel agency employees almost always arrive at 8:45 am, and the design studio employees almost always arrive at 8:45 am. Today, the travel agency employees arrived at 8:45 am. The design studio employees also arrived at 8:45 am, as usual. So, today, the climate control system turned on at 8:45 am. Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
Model's Response: (B) No
Correct Label: (A) Yes

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Interpretation of Cause: The model might be interpreting the cause as the single or sole entity that initiates the effect. Since the prompt encourages the breakdown of causation into various factors, the exclusive role of the design studio agents in activating the climate control system may seem unclear to the model. However, the problem states both offices can independently activate the system, despite arriving together. The model failed to factor in this information properly.
   
2. Multifactor Causation: In this example, the activation of the climate control system is due to the aggregation of employees from both offices. However, it was also stated that each office could independently cause the system to activate. The model might have misinterpreted this information, attributing the cause of the activation to both offices in tandem, rather than considering them individually.
   
3. Timing: The model might have attributed the simultaneous arrival of the employees at 8:45 am as an essential condition for the system to activate. This could have been due to a misunderstanding of the role of timing in this scenario.

To Improve the Prompt:
1. Clarify Concept of Cause: Reinforce that cause is not necessarily an isolated single event but can be derived from multiple factors or contributors, each of which alone could be sufficient for the result.
   
2. Address Assumptions on Time: Signal that the timing of different factors doesn't automatically make them a combined cause but they could independently set off an effect.
   
3. Allow for Individual Causes: Highlight that even when multiple factors are present and can cause the event, each one should be equally considered in isolation if they individually can bring about the effect.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects. Strive to incorporate a holistic view of events and actions. To indicate your answer choice, place it between <answer> and </answer>.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START>
When answering questions about causal attribution, appreciate the intricacy and multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events critically, taking into account multiple factors. Do not concentrate extensively on the final or most recent event; instead, recognize that each event, action, or presence involved may independently or conjointly influence the outcome. Break down conditional statements to understand the cause, being aware that the cause does not always equate to an intentional action.

Prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions in your analysis, but also understand that outcomes may emerge unrelated to those intentions. Note that an outcome is identified as intentional only when it matches the actor's primary objectives. Similarly, cases where the outcome occurs regardless of the original intention due to the presence of alternative conditions need to be identified accurately.

Comprehend the implications of unintended outcomes that arise when the snags of a situation are not fully grasped by the actor. Scrutinize dependencies and the potential ramifications of different possible scenarios, especially when various conditions need synchronization for an event to happen, and refrain from tagging any single variable as the only cause.

Your approach should encompass a nuanced understanding of causality, with a focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unpredicted impacts. When different contributors can independently trigger the event, each should be evaluated as a separate potential cause. Maintain a balanced perspective, focusing equally on all actors or factors involved.

Stay clear of simplifying or complicating the analysis disproportionately to the complexity of the situation. Rather, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions, bearing in mind the necessary equilibrium between the detail of your analysis and the complication of the scenario. Improve accuracy by honing in on the timing of variables and avoid assumptions that may inaccurately combine independent causes. 

Finally, ensure to frame your finalized answer between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

Do not attribute disproportionate weight to the final or latest events; instead, recognize that each event and action involved may influence the outcome. The decoding of conditional statements is vital to properly discern the cause, considering that cause does not always correspond to intentional action. In your analysis, prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions but also acknowledge that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of those intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is deemed intentional only if it aligns with the actor's primary goals.

Understand the role of unintended consequences that arise when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay close attention to dependencies and the potential impact of different scenarios. If an event would have occurred regardless of a certain action due to an existing condition, consider this information when assigning responsibility. The goal is to maintain a balanced view, focusing equally on all actors involved. Avoid oversimplification or overcomplication, matching the level of your analysis to the complexity of the situation.

Your approach should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality, with focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative scenarios, and unforeseeable effects. When multiple conditions need alignment for an event to occur, no single condition should be labelled as the sole cause.

In summary, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions maintaining the balance between the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Place your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights and pulls the trigger-thereby killing the deer. Unfortunately, the bullet exited the deer's body and struck a hunter who was hiding nearby. Did the man intentionally shoot the hunter?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend is happy to sell it. Bill makes an offer, but his friend insists on him not paying so much. Finally, Bill buys the right-side Bartlett bookend from his friend and goes home. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the hunter?
Incorrect model response: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>
Correct response: <answer>(B) No</answer>
Reason: The model neglected the emphasis on the intention behind the actions. The hunter's aim was to shoot the deer to win the competition. There might be an unintentional causation, as he ended up shooting another hunter after the bullet exited the deer's body, but that doesn't mean he intentionally shot the hunter. His intention was to shoot the deer, not the other hunter. The language model should have considered this important aspect of the prompt.

Example 2:
Question: Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
Incorrect model response: <answer>(B) No</answer>
Correct response: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>
Reason: Bill's decision to buy the right-side Bartlett bookend indirectly leads to his and Sue having a paired set of bookends when Sue brings home the left side. Here, the direct cause and indirect cause concepts and attribution to the final event might have confused the language model, making it ignore the fact that Bill's intentional action significantly contributed to possessing the paired set. 

Based on these two examples, there are several ways in which the prompt can be improved:
1. The prompt should further clarify the importance of intentionality in determining the causation. It needs to explicitly stress on the actor's primary goals, separating the intention from the actual outcome.
2. The prompt should guide the language model to discern between direct and indirect causes and determine the level of responsibility appropriately. The phrase about focusing equally on all actors could be misleading as all actors' actions might not be equally significant in causing the event.
3. Asking the model to maintain a balance between more complex analyses and straightforward attributions could be encouraging indecisiveness. This ambiguity could be resolved by further defining the terms "oversimplification" or "overcomplication" or providing clearer criteria for deciding when a situation is complex enough to warrant deeper analysis.
4. The model should be explicitly prompted to differentiate between a cause and a catalyst. For example, in example 1, the hunter was an indirect cause(a catalyst) and not the direct cause.
5. Finally, the prompt could incorporate more on sequential and conditional causality, allowing the model to understand how events are linked in a progression or under certain conditions, such as in example 2, where sequential actions lead to the final event.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects. Strive to incorporate a holistic view of events and actions. To indicate your answer choice, place it between <answer> and </answer>.

2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> While determining causal attribution, acknowledge the intricate interplay of numerous aspects that contribute to an event. Conduct a meticulous examination of every sequence of actions, every event, and their interdependence. Remember not to oversimplify by attributing most or all weight to the final or most recent event; instead, comprehend the influence of each event and action on the outcome. Conversely, avoid overcomplication by attributing equal importance to all actors involved. Emphasize instead on identifying key actions or events that significantly influenced the outcome.

Decoding conditional statements is crucial to distinguish between an intended consequence and a mere outcome. Highlight the interpretation of motivations and intentions behind each action, but remember that not all outcomes may align with these intentions. Understand that an outcome is considered intentional only if it conforms to the underlying primary objectives of the actor. 

Delve into the unintended consequences emerging from an actor's lack of complete comprehension or misjudgment of the situation. Assess the dependencies and the prospective effects of alternative scenarios carefully. Keep in mind that if an event might have ensued even without a certain action because of an already met condition, this knowledge should be factored in when establishing causality.

In your analysis, identify both direct and indirect causes and differentiate them from mere catalysts. Your understanding of causality should be nuanced, focusing on actions, dependencies, motivations, alternative possibilities, and unexpected effects. Recognize that when a multitude of conditions needs to align for an event to occur, no single condition should solely be identified as the cause. 

In conclusion, strive for a comprehensive interpretation of events and actions. Attempt to strike a balance considering the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Frame your selected answer choice by placing it between <answer> and </answer> for a clear presentation. Remember, your goal here is to uncover causality's multifaceted tapestry, not simplifying it to a single thread or complicating it to an untraceable map. <END>

Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Suzy is the only one permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, whereas Billy is the only one permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Billy is not permitted to log into the central computer in the morning. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?

When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to grasp the complexity and multi-angular nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events thoroughly, taking into account multiple factors. Do not attribute disproportionate weight to the final or latest events; instead, recognize that each event and action involved may influence the outcome. The decoding of conditional statements is vital to properly discern the cause, considering that cause does not always correspond to intentional action. In your analysis, prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions but also acknowledge that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of those intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is deemed intentional only if it aligns with the actor's primary goals.

Understand the role of unintended consequences that arise when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay close attention to dependencies and the potential impact of different scenarios. If an event would have occurred regardless of a certain action due to an existing condition, consider this information when assigning responsibility. The goal is to maintain a balanced view, focusing equally on all actors involved. Avoid oversimplification or overcomplication, matching the level of your analysis to the complexity of the situation.

Your approach should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality, with focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative scenarios, and unforeseeable effects. When multiple conditions need alignment for an event to occur, no single condition should be labelled as the sole cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is green, so he is supposed to drive across the bridge immediately. Suzy's signal is green, so she is also supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of collapse. If either of them drives their train onto the bridge, it will collapse. Either train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge. Billy follows his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses. Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In this scenario, the model wrongly identifies Suzy as the cause of the error even though both Suzy and Billy logged into the computer at the same time. The primary causes leading to this incorrect attribution can be:
1. Misinterpretation of 'Causal Role': The model seems to be associating the cause with the person who had the most legitimate action at the time of the incident (Suzy). This is a misunderstanding as, in this specific case, both Suzy and Billy contributed to the outcome.
2. Misunderstanding of 'Intentionality': Even though neither Suzy nor Billy intended for the emails to be deleted, they both logged in simultaneously, resulting in the incident. The model may have solely focused on legality (policy adherence), which led to an incorrect understanding of the roles of the individuals involved.

<2>
Similarly, in this case, the model incorrectly identifies that Billy did not cause the collapse, despite him and Suzy both equally contributing to the outcome. The following issues likely contributed to this error:
1. Misunderstanding of 'Shared Causality': The model seems to struggle with the concept of shared causality, where multiple individuals or actions lead to an output. In this case, both Billy and Suzy caused the bridge to collapse, but the model seems to seek a single actor at fault.
2. Complexity of Scenario: This prompt is considerably complex as it requires understanding of simultaneous actions leading to a single outcome. The rules laid out in the prompt are not entirely compatible with such scenarios.

Based on these reasons, the following improvements should be considered for the prompt:
1. Clear Explanation of Shared Causality: Make sure to emphasize that multiple individuals or actions can share responsibility for a given outcome. This is important in scenarios where actions are performed simultaneously or collectively contribute to a result.
2. Robust Understanding of Rules: The model seems to focus too much on the given rules or policies when determining causality. The prompt should specify that while rules or protocol are important, they do not necessarily determine causality.
3. Focus on Actions, Not Legality: Ensure the prompt suggests prioritizing actions taken by individuals, regardless of their legality within the scenario's context. 
4. Emphasize on Complexity and Variability: The prompt should stress on understanding the variability and complexity of scenarios, and how different actions interconnect to influence an outcome. A binary understanding of cause and effect is inadequate for such complex scenarios.
5. Deal with Unintended Outcomes: Ensure the model understands that intentions are not always directly correlated with outcomes. An action could lead to unintended consequences, and this does not exempt the individuals from the causal chain.
6. Handling of Simultaneous Incidences: Ensure the prompt instructs the model to handle simultaneous actions effectively. Multiple actions occurring at the same time can share causality for a single outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects. Strive to incorporate a holistic view of events and actions. To indicate your answer choice, place it between <answer> and </answer>.

When dealing with causal attribution questions, one must concurrently maintain a discerning approach and a comprehensive perspective. Understand that the causality often has a complex and intertwined nature. Execute a rigorous analysis of the sequences of actions and events, while acknowledging that multiple factors can contribute to an outcome. In your analysis, avoid attributing disproportionate weight to the final or latest events and actions; instead, appreciate each event and action's potential influence on the final outcome.

Consider that the cause of an event does not always align with intentional action, thus decoding of conditional statements becomes crucial. While it's important to recognize the motivations and intentions behind actions, also take into account that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of the intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is usually deemed intentional if it aligns with the actor's primary goals, but this does not absolve others from causal responsibility.

Appreciate the role and impact of unintended consequences that may occur when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay heed to dependencies and potential impacts of divergent scenarios. If an event was precariously set to occur due to conditional circumstances, irrespective of a certain actor's involvement, this information should factor into your causality assignment.

Aim to maintain a balanced view, focusing on all actors involved equally. When determining causality, it's important to avoid narrowing down to a sole condition even in situations where multiple conditions needed alignment for an event to occur. The prompt is instructing you to avoid oversimplifying or overcomplicating the situation. It's critical to match the depth of your analysis to the complexity of the scenario at hand.

Finally, your analysis should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality with a primary focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, potential alternative scenarios, and unforeseen effects. At the conclusion of your analytical process, your understanding should blend all these aspects harmoniously. A balanced and comprehensive view of events and actions should be your end goal.

Once you pinpoint your answer, please bracket your selected answer option with <answer> and </answer> tags in order to maintain clarity and consistency in the response.

cur_prompt: When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event. Thus, careful analysis of conditional statements is integral to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. Remember, a cause is not always the result of an intentional action.

Lastly, express your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>, carefully representing your causal attribution analysis in a clear, condensed form. Be open to complex causal relationships and make full use of common sense reasoning in your deliberations.

When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event. Thus, careful analysis of conditional statements is integral to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. Remember, a cause is not always the result of an intentional action.

Lastly, express your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>, carefully representing your causal attribution analysis in a clear, condensed form. Be open to complex causal relationships and make full use of common sense reasoning in your deliberations.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jake desperately wants to have more money. He knows that he will inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But Jake isn't very good at using his rifle. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet hits her directly in the heart. She dies instantly. Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jake's actions indicate that he intended to shoot his aunt, as he raised his rifle, aimed at her, and pressed the trigger. Despite his lack of skill with the rifle and the accidental nature of the shot, the outcome of hitting his aunt directly in the heart suggests intentional action on Jake's part.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:

Question: Jake desperately wants to have more money. He knows that he will inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But Jake isn't very good at using his rifle. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet hits her directly in the heart. She dies instantly. Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Wrong Answer: (A) Yes
Correct Answer: (B) No

Step by Step Analysis:

1. The premise provides two important pieces of information: Jake's desire for money and his anticipation of inheriting money after his aunt's death.
2. The scenario then places Jake in a position where he raises his rifle and sees his aunt in his line of sight. This signals his potential intent to shoot.
3. However, the crucial detail here is that Jake's hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, indicating that the act was accidental rather than intentional. Despite the outcome of the shot hitting his aunt's heart and killing her instantly, it was not a direct result of a calculated action by Jake. 
4. The model focuses too much on Jake's potential motivations (wanting money and knowing he'll inherit after his aunt dies), which leads to the misinterpretation that he intentionally kills her. It fails to register the unintentional nature of the final action (hand slipping), leading to the wrong assignment of causality.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:

1. The model overemphasized the possible motives of Jake and overlooked the key element that the shot was accidental.
2. The prompt did not effectively guide the model to differentiate poor motor coordination (slipping hands) from intentional action.
3. The model misinterpreted the anticipatory character of Jake actions (preparing to potentially shoot), with the act of shooting itself.

Based on these reasons, improvements to the prompt can include:

1. The prompt should emphasize more on the importance of differentiating between an intention to act and the actual execution of the action.
2. The prompt should highlight the need to critically evaluate the sequence of actions and pay attention to all pieces of information provided about these actions, especially those signaling an unintentional act.
3. The prompt should guide the model to be more discerning about attributing causality based on possible motives and to consider unforeseen circumstances that may alter the outcome.
4. The prompt should instruct the model to separate and evaluate the underlying motivations for an act from the act itself.
5. The prompt should encourage the model to avoid projection bias i.e., viewing actions as intentional simply based on the information about the person's motive or benefit.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> When attributing causality, it's essential to consider all contributing factors and steps leading up to the event. Be discerning in your analysis, differentiating between intentional actions, unintended outcomes, and accidental occurrences that could influence the event's result. Keep in mind that there could exist a spectrum of causes, each with its own degree of contribution. 

Particularly focus on distinguishing between an intention to act and the actual execution of the action. Every detail about the sequence of actions must be meticulously evaluated. Remember, a seemingly intentional act could be influenced by unforeseen elements like accidents, resulting in outcomes that may not reflex direct intent.

Understand that cause and effect often involve complex interactions, and avoid attributing the outcome solely to the final or most visible event or action. Intentionality is an important factor, but be careful not to mistake anticipation or potential motivation for intentional acts. Look beyond motivations that may align with the outcome, and recognize when an outcome, while beneficial to an actor, may have resulted from unforeseen or accidental circumstances rather than being directly caused by the actor's intentional actions.

As you navigate through conditional statements, pay attention to the distinction among actions that merely condition an event, those that trigger an event, and those that serve as prerequisites. Evaluate whether an outcome is a result of a necessary action, a sufficient action, or both, and consider instances of joint causality when multiple events or individuals contribute to the outcome.

Finally, encapsulate your conclusion of cause in an easy-to-comprehend manner by placing your answer choice between <answer> and </answer>. Be prepared for complex causal relationships and engage in common sense reasoning to refine your judgment. Not all causes result from intentional actions, always remember to separate the act from the motive and avoid projection bias in your examination. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog simultaneously taking the last pencil from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog's action alone did not lead to the outcome. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
When examining the provided wrong example, several potential issues with the prompt emerge. 

Step 1: Reading the Question
The question was about whether the hedgehog caused the problem specified, that is, the polar bear not finishing his homework. The prompt generally highlights the complexity of causal relationships, which is apt considering the scenario given. However, it might lead the model into overthinking the situation.

Step 2: Considering the Prompt's Guidance 
One potential issue in the prompt is the heavy emphasis on complex causal relationships and joint causality. This focus might have led the model to dismiss the more straightforward causality â€” despite circumventing the rule, the hedgehog's action directly contributed to the lack of pencils hence causing the problem for the polar bear.

Step 3: Reading the Model's Answer
The model's response: "The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog simultaneously taking the last pencil from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog's action alone did not lead to the outcome." indicates that the model has looked into joint causality but hasn't considered the separate causal actions of the bear and hedgehog.

Step 4: Comparing with the Correct Answer
The correct answer is A, the hedgehog did cause the problem. The model selected answer B, indicating incorrect causal attribution based on the prompt's guidelines.

Based on these steps, several improvements can be suggested:

1. Provide more guidance on handling violations against established norms or rules, as the hedgehog's behavior was a clear violation.
2. Emphasize more on individual actions contribution to the outcome, not only joint causality.
3. Maintain balance between considering complex causal relationships and not overlooking simple and direct relationships.
4. Introduce a clause about accountability or responsibility under rules established within the story/question context.
5. Encourage the model to consider more closely the prompt's own information and context, rather than applying 'generic' assumptions about cause and effect.
6. Lastly, ensure the model considers rule-breaking as a contributory factor to causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog simultaneously taking the last pencil from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog's action alone did not lead to the outcome. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
When examining the provided wrong example, several potential issues with the prompt emerge. 

Step 1: Reading the Question
The question was about whether the hedgehog caused the problem specified, that is, the polar bear not finishing his homework. The prompt generally highlights the complexity of causal relationships, which is apt considering the scenario given. However, it might lead the model into overthinking the situation.

Step 2: Considering the Prompt's Guidance 
One potential issue in the prompt is the heavy emphasis on complex causal relationships and joint causality. This focus might have led the model to dismiss the more straightforward causality â€” despite circumventing the rule, the hedgehog's action directly contributed to the lack of pencils hence causing the problem for the polar bear.

Step 3: Reading the Model's Answer
The model's response: "The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog simultaneously taking the last pencil from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog's action alone did not lead to the outcome." indicates that the model has looked into joint causality but hasn't considered the separate causal actions of the bear and hedgehog.

Step 4: Comparing with the Correct Answer
The correct answer is A, the hedgehog did cause the problem. The model selected answer B, indicating incorrect causal attribution based on the prompt's guidelines.

Based on these steps, several improvements can be suggested:

1. Provide more guidance on handling violations against established norms or rules, as the hedgehog's behavior was a clear violation.
2. Emphasize more on individual actions contribution to the outcome, not only joint causality.
3. Maintain balance between considering complex causal relationships and not overlooking simple and direct relationships.
4. Introduce a clause about accountability or responsibility under rules established within the story/question context.
5. Encourage the model to consider more closely the prompt's own information and context, rather than applying 'generic' assumptions about cause and effect.
6. Lastly, ensure the model considers rule-breaking as a contributory factor to causality.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action. Lastly, express your answer choice by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event.

<START> 
In assigning causal attribution, it's important to remember that we operate within circumstances involving various influencing factors. Start by thoroughly examining each event sequence, including both actions and reactions. In your dissection, scrutinize the conditional statements, and explore the motivations and intentions behind each action. Understand that motivations, whether apparent or concealed, can bear different implications when analyzing a cause and effect relationship. Be careful not to attribute the outcome solely to the last or most recent event, but see it in the context of all preceding events, including any imposed rules or restrictions.

While identifying unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, always place emphasis on intentionality. Comprehend that intentional actions may give rise to unintended consequences. Be meticulous in interpreting conditions when attributing causes; a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Pay special attention to simultaneous events, highlighting their role in causing a particular outcome.

Acknowledging that causes often populate a spectrum is key. They can vary in their degree of interference to an event. Through the necessary dissection of conditional statements, learn to differentiate between actions that act as conditions, those that trigger an event and those that are mere prerequisites. Remember, intentional action is not always synonymous with a cause.

Crucially, pay attention to the stated rules within the question narrative. Understand that violation of these rules has a direct causal implication. Therefore, individuals undertaking actions against stated norms should be considered causative elements.

Formulate your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by placing it between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring to summarize your causal attribution analysis in a precise way. Continually stay open-minded to the investigation of complex causal relationships, but also remember to weigh direct cause-effect relationships in an uncomplicated manner. Always apply your common sense reasoning throughout this process.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Eugene and Tina were a young married couple who lived in the country. Both were partially paralyzed and confined to wheelchairs. They had met four years before when Tina was a counsellor with the Canadian Paraplegic Association, had fallen in love, and were married one year later. On this particular evening, Eugene had phoned to request a cab to take them downtown. When the taxi driver arrived, Eugene and Tina were waiting by the street. On seeing that they were both in wheelchairs, the taxi driver refused their fare because he thought it would be too crowded in the taxi with both of them and the wheelchairs. So the taxi driver headed back downtown without them. Because there was no time to call another cab, Eugene and Tina took Tina's car, which was equipped with special hand controls. In order to get downtown from their house, they had to travel across a bridge over Rupert River. A severe storm the night before had weakened the structure of the bridge. About 5 minutes before Eugene and Tina reached it, a section of the bridge collapsed. The taxi driver had reached the bridge about 15 minutes before them, and made it safely across. In the dark, Eugene and Tina drove off the collapsed bridge and their car plummeted into the river below. They both drowned. Their bodies were retrieved from the car the next morning. Did the taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina cause their death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina did not directly cause their death. While his decision may have contributed to the sequence of events that led to their tragic end, it was not the sole cause. The weakened structure of the bridge, the severe storm, and the subsequent collapse were all significant factors that ultimately resulted in their death.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish (Moules Mariniere made in a wine sauce) did contribute to Karen's death due to her rare hereditary disease that caused a severe allergic reaction to fermented drinks. However, it was not an intentional action on Mr. Carlson's part to harm Karen. The lack of knowledge about Karen's condition and the unintentional nature of the choice should be taken into consideration.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that when the bullet travels through the air it will definitely disturb the air molecules around it. But the sniper doesn't care at all about disturbing air molecules, he just wants to shoot his target. So, he pulls the trigger. As the sniper expected, as the bullet travels from his gun into the enemy commander, it disturbed some air molecules. Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?

<1> 

The model's response seems to reflect a logical interpretation of the chain of events - the taxi driver's refusal did set the couple on the path to their unfortunate end. However, the model doesn't place an emphasis on the inevitability of the situation due to this refusal, which seems to be implied in the correct answer. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the model might be placing more importance on prominent physical events (like the bridge collapse) over human actions (like the taxi driver's refusal).

<2>

The model focused too much on the intentionality of Mr. Carlson's action. The prompt stresses on distinguishing between unintended outcomes of intentional actions, which might have lead the model to conclude that since Mr. Carlson had no intention of causing harm, his action shouldn't be seen as the cause of Karen's death. However, the objective reality here is that his choice did directly cause the allergic reaction that led to Karen's death, thus his action was causative regardless of his intentions.

<3>

The model seems to interpret the distinction between action and consequence too broadly. The sniper did intentionally pull the trigger knowing the bullet would disturb air molecules, but the act of disturbing the air molecules was not the sniper's primary intention; this is a nuance that the model does not capture. 

Improvements to Prompt:

1. Specify a broader definition of 'cause' in your prompt, which includes events or actions that indirectly but inevitably set a chain of events in motion.

2. Adjust the prompt to be clearer that an action can still be considered a 'cause' of an event even if it is unintentional or a side effect of achieving a different goal.

3. Include an emphasis on acknowledging collateral events that occur due to the primary events or actions when considering causal attributions.

4. Include a point to consider the overall direct and indirect consequences of any action, rather than just immediate, intended or primary effects.
   
5. The prompt should address the intricacies of causality more explicitly, stressing that outcomes may often be the result of a complex web of related factors, including those that appear insignificant or coincidental. 

6. Reinforce the point that intentionality and causality are separate and an unintended cause can still be a 'cause'.

The weakened structure of the bridge, the severe storm, and the subsequent collapse were all significant factors that ultimately resulted in their death.

The model's input is:
When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event. Thus, careful analysis of conditional statements is integral to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. Remember, a cause is not always the result of an intentional action.

Lastly, express your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>, carefully representing your causal attribution analysis in a clear, condensed form. Be open to complex causal relationships and make full use of common sense reasoning in your deliberations.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish (Moules Mariniere made in a wine sauce) did contribute to Karen's death due to her rare hereditary disease that caused a severe allergic reaction to fermented drinks. However, it was not an intentional action on Mr. Carlson's part to harm Karen. The lack of knowledge about Karen's condition and the unintentional nature of the choice should be taken into consideration.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that when the bullet travels through the air it will definitely disturb the air molecules around it. But the sniper doesn't care at all about disturbing air molecules, he just wants to shoot his target. So, he pulls the trigger. As the sniper expected, as the bullet travels from his gun into the enemy commander, it disturbed some air molecules. Did the sniper intentionally disturb some air molecules?

(A) Yes

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

The model's response seems to reflect a logical interpretation of the chain of events - the taxi driver's refusal did set the couple on the path to their unfortunate end. However, the model doesn't place an emphasis on the inevitability of the situation due to this refusal, which seems to be implied in the correct answer. This discrepancy could be due to the fact that the model might be placing more importance on prominent physical events (like the bridge collapse) over human actions (like the taxi driver's refusal).

<2>

The model focused too much on the intentionality of Mr. Carlson's action. The prompt stresses on distinguishing between unintended outcomes of intentional actions, which might have lead the model to conclude that since Mr. Carlson had no intention of causing harm, his action shouldn't be seen as the cause of Karen's death. However, the objective reality here is that his choice did directly cause the allergic reaction that led to Karen's death, thus his action was causative regardless of his intentions.

<3>

The model seems to interpret the distinction between action and consequence too broadly. The sniper did intentionally pull the trigger knowing the bullet would disturb air molecules, but the act of disturbing the air molecules was not the sniper's primary intention; this is a nuance that the model does not capture. 

Improvements to Prompt:

1. Specify a broader definition of 'cause' in your prompt, which includes events or actions that indirectly but inevitably set a chain of events in motion.

2. Adjust the prompt to be clearer that an action can still be considered a 'cause' of an event even if it is unintentional or a side effect of achieving a different goal.

3. Include an emphasis on acknowledging collateral events that occur due to the primary events or actions when considering causal attributions.

4. Include a point to consider the overall direct and indirect consequences of any action, rather than just immediate, intended or primary effects.
   
5. The prompt should address the intricacies of causality more explicitly, stressing that outcomes may often be the result of a complex web of related factors, including those that appear insignificant or coincidental. 

6. Reinforce the point that intentionality and causality are separate and an unintended cause can still be a 'cause'.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action.

When determining causal attribution, bear in mind that an event usually has multiple catalyzing factors, that can directly or indirectly contribute. Scrutinize every action, event sequence and contextual factor, considering the interdependencies that exist amongst them. Ignore not even the trivial or coincidental factors, as they can sometimes initiate complex webs of causality. Within your analysis, prioritize understanding conditional statements and delve into the motivations and intentions behind each action, but remember that an action's outcome may still qualify as a cause even if it was unintentional or a side effect of achieving a different objective. 

Acknowledge the multitudinous implications of these motivations and intentions and don't solely attribute the outcome to the final or most recent event. Instead, view it in the wider context of all preceding and collateral events. Make a deliberate effort to identify instances of joint causality, where numerous events or individuals cumulatively contribute towards an outcome.

Differentiate accurately between unintentional outcomes and planned actions. Recollect that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not initially intended. Avoid any inadvertent misinterpretation of conditions when assigning causes, always remembering that a cause might be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Show particular care when dealing with simultaneous events, knowing that they may carry equal significance in triggering an outcome.

As you navigate through the process, be aware that causes often exist on a spectrum and exhibit varying degrees of contribution to an event. Hence, thorough analysis of conditional statements becomes imperative to distinguish between actions that condition an event, actions that provoke an event and actions that simply set the stage. Remember, a cause is not always attributable to an intentional action and can at times be an unintended yet inevitable result.

Finally, express your selection of the answer, irrespective of whether it's subtle or straightforward, by positioning it securely amongst <answer> and </answer> tags. This will represent your causal attribution analysis in a clear and concise format. Appreciate the complexity of causal relationships in your analysis and apply common sense reasoning to your deliberations for robust and comprehensive deductions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Todd, Anne, Jason, and Steph all share an account for a popular online television streaming service. In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Todd, Anne, and Jason regularly use their account from their laptops on Saturdays. This Saturday, as usual, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Sure enough, since three people logged into the streaming account at the same time, the account was suspended. Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended?

The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine.

<1> 

Question: Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended?

Incorrect Answer: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

First, in this example, the model incorrectly assigns sole blame to Todd, despite the prompt explicitly stating "Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause". It seems the model struggles with understanding that all three users (Todd, Anne, and Jason) were required for the account suspension to occur. It's a classic "straw that broke the camel's back" scenario, and the model should be interpreting the prompt to understand that no individual action can be singled out as the primary cause. 

Second, the model fails to analyze how "multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur". In this example, all three users (Todd, Anne, and Jason) logging into the account simultaneously is what caused the account to be suspended. It wasn't solely due to Todd's login.

<2> 

Question: Did the red wire cause the short circuit?

Incorrect Answer: <answer>(B) No</answer>

In this example, the model has misunderstood the causality of the event. The problem lies with the interpretation of the prompt's instruction to "be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes". Here, the model has failed to acknowledge that both wires touching the battery were needed for a short circuit â€” the red wire was just as vital as the black one.

Improvements:

1. Revise the prompt to emphasize that the presence of multiple conditions does not exclude any condition from being a cause. Each effective condition contributes to the end result.
2. Highlight that each event in a chain of events can be a potential cause of the final outcome, even if it's not the final event in the chronological order.
3. Make it clear that a cause can be part of a combination of factors that lead to an effect. The cause does not have to work in isolation.
4. Further stress the importance of considering the specific context of each situation in determining causality.
5. Enhance the direction about how the model should evaluate dependencies among events and conditions. Be explicit that just because the event didn't single-handedly cause the outcome, it doesn't mean it could not be a contributing factor.
6. Include instructions to answer the causation question with a clear affirmative or negative to prevent over-interpretation.

The problem lies with the interpretation of the prompt's instruction to "be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes". Here, the model has failed to acknowledge that both wires touching the battery were needed for a short circuit â€” the red wire was just as vital as the black one.

Improvements:

1. Revise the prompt to emphasize that the presence of multiple conditions does not exclude any condition from being a cause. Each effective condition contributes to the end result.
2. Highlight that each event in a chain of events can be a potential cause of the final outcome, even if it's not the final event in the chronological order.
3. Make it clear that a cause can be part of a combination of factors that lead to an effect. The cause does not have to work in isolation.
4. Further stress the importance of considering the specific context of each situation in determining causality.
5. Enhance the direction about how the model should evaluate dependencies among events and conditions. Be explicit that just because the event didn't single-handedly cause the outcome, it doesn't mean it could not be a contributing factor.
6. Include instructions to answer the causation question with a clear affirmative or negative to prevent over-interpretation.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, it is crucial to understand the chronological series of events and the significance of each event in leading to the end result. Comprehend the inferences of conditional statements for cause and effect and how multiple factors might contribute to an event. Carefully consider all stages or events, prioritizing the temporal sequence, especially when multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur. Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome. Examine each situation based on its unique context and avoid generalizing causal rules. Lastly, be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.

response:
<START> When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure a deep understanding of the chain of events in a chronological order and their roles in the final outcome. Think critically about conditional statements to understand how cause and effect relationships are indicated. When examining an event, evaluate the multiple factors that may be intertwined, particularly when multiple conditions must be met separately for the outcome to happen. Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event, as every preceding incident is potentially part of the causative chain. Treat each situation as unique and avoid generalizing causal rules. Do not understate the significance of a certain event or condition just because it did not cause the outcome by itself. A cause can be part of a set of conditions leading to an event, without being solely responsible for it. Understand the dependencies among different events and conditions, ensuring each one is given due consideration in the cause ascription. Once you have scrutinized the interdependent association among events, form your answer. Remember, causality may be a result of a combination of factors, rather than an isolated event.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy are freight train conductors. One day, they happen to approach an old two-way rail bridge from opposite directions at the same time. There are signals on either side of the bridge. Billy's signal is green, so he is supposed to drive across the bridge immediately. Suzy's signal is green, so she is also supposed to drive across immediately. Neither of them realizes that the bridge is on the verge of collapse. If either of them drives their train onto the bridge, it will collapse. Either train is heavy enough on its own to break the bridge. Billy follows his signal and drives his train onto the bridge immediately at the same time that Suzy follows her signal and drives her train onto the bridge. Both trains move onto the bridge at the same time, and at that moment the bridge collapses. Did Billy cause the bridge to collapse?

(A) Yes

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Kylie and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. However, Drew doesn't usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, unexpectedly, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, and Oliver also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by focusing on the fact that the coffee shop only needs one person to order coffee in order to make a profit that day. Therefore, Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday did contribute to the coffee shop making a profit that day, along with Kylie and Oliver also ordering coffee. However, it is important to note that the profit was not solely dependent on Drew ordering coffee. All three customers ordering coffee collectively led to the coffee shop making a profit that day.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells Suzy: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Then he tells Billy: "Be sure that you do not come in at all tomorrow morning. It is absolutely essential that you not appear at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if at least one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by considering the boss's instructions to Suzy and Billy, the fact that both arrived at 9 am, and the presence of the motion detector. They may conclude that Billy did not cause the motion detector to go off, as he was explicitly told not to come in at that time. The motion detector was triggered because both Suzy and Billy appeared in the room simultaneously, which was not Billy's fault.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:

The prompt may have caused a misunderstanding to the language model. The guideline "do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome." could have led the model to devalue the role of Billy's crossing the bridge as it was the most recent action. However, in this scenario, both Billy and Suzy's actions are equivalent and simultaneous causes. The predetermined script had also made it clear that either of them driving onto the bridge would cause the bridge to collapse. The incorrect answer given suggests that the model's understanding of this causal rule might not accommodate scenarios where multiple causes have an equal and sufficient impact.

For Example 2:

The model might have been confused by the statement "Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day." The model might interpret the sentence as 'any one person ordering coffee would make a profit'. But the fact is that when other factors are given (like Kylie and Oliver also order coffee on the same day), the causal effect of Drew ordering coffee should not be accountable.

For Example 3:

Again, similar to Example 1, the model could be falling into the trap of underemphasizing the importance of individual contributions in cases of multiple causation. It seems to be swayed by Billy being told not to be present, giving this fact too much interpretative weight, and failing to recognize Billy's actual presence as a causative factor. 

Overall, the reasons the prompt led to the wrong answers could be because it could:

1. Confuse the model in scenarios where multiple causes have an equal and sufficient impact.
2. Misinterpret 'one-person' or 'one-condition' sufficiency into single-handed cause in the presence of other causative factors.
3. Overemphasize instructions, actions, or conditions which are contrary to the scenario's outcome.

To improve the prompt, we could:

1. Specify that multiple factors can simultaneously be the primary cause if introduced to the situation at the same moment.
2. Adjust the instruction, emphasizing considering different outcomes within a given context; if one condition is considered sufficient, it doesn't necessarily mean it is a cause when other conditions are also met.
3. Make the model pay equal attention to factual conditions and direct causes than pre-set conditions or instructions.
4. Ask the model to consider the actual sequence of events and contributions, not just prescribed plans or instructions.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Representatives from the research and development department of a company reported to the board and said, "We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also help the environment." The board consisted of three members: Benson, Franklin, and Sorel. For various reasons, each of them personally opposed the program and tried to prevent it from being implemented. However, they were obliged to follow the board's standard decision-making protocol, which left no opportunity for their personal views to influence the decision. As a result, in line with the company's business policies and in the interest of maximizing profits, the new program was implemented. Sure enough, the program was highly profitable and the environment was helped. Did the board intentionally help the environment?

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
Prompt Analysis: The prompt highlights the importance of comprehending the sequence of events and their relative significance towards the final outcome. However, it does not mention considering the intentionality behind each event. In this instance, the lack of emphasis on intentionality may have caused the confusion in the model's answering. The question specifically asks if "the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun." Although the sniper's main intention was not to heat up the barrel (which is likely why the AI selected 'No'), he knowingly did an act that resulted in the barrel getting heated, which does entail intentionality under most definitions.  

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. The AI did not appear to consider the direct connection between the act of firing a gun and the consequent heating of the barrel.
2. The model possibly interpreted the question more on the sniper's lack of concern about the barrel's heat than the action that led to the heating.

Wrong Example 2:
Prompt Analysis: The prompt emphasizes understanding cause and effect relationships and the temporal sequence of events, yet it does not highlight the necessity for distinguishing between corollary results and intended outcomes. In the example provided, the new program leading to environmental benefits was a side effect, not the board's primary goal. Despite this, the AI incorrectly concluded the board "intentionally" helped the environment.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. The model failed to distinguish between the intentional and unintentional consequences of the board's decision.
2. The model focused on the positive environmental outcome from the decision, even though it wasn't the intended purpose of implementing the new program. 

Improvements for Prompt:
Based on these analyses, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:
1. Incorporate the importance of assessing intentional versus unintentional events or outcomes within the sequence of events.
2. Ensure the model comprehends that a preceding event/action may not necessarily reflect the direct intent for a subsequent event to occur.
3. Emphasize understanding the primary and secondary objectives or outcomes of each stage/event.
4. Highlight the significance of considering actions that may occur naturally or predictably from a given stage/event, regardless of whether that outcome is 'cared about' or directly intended by the actor.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Incorrect Example:
The model's response to the question "Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?" is <answer>(B) No</answer>. However, the correct answer should be (A) Yes.

Explanation:
The question asks whether Wayne's decision to not move the device is the reason the device got fully charged or not. The condition for the device to be fully charged requires it to be both plugged in and on the charging pad. Since Wayne checked and confirmed its position on the charging pad and didn't move it, his inaction indirectly led to the device getting charged. This is an instance of indirect causation, where lack of action was also a contributing factor. The model may have misinterpreted the prompt's instruction to "Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event" and focused on the physical actions only (which in this case was the act of plugging in), overlooking the significance of inaction (leaving the device on the pad). 

<2>
Incorrect Example:
The model's response to the question "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?" is <answer>(A) Yes</answer>. However, the correct answer should be (B) No.

Explanation: 
This case presents a challenge over the attribution of intentions. Bobâ€™s primary intention was to rob the bank and gather as much money as possible. His intent to cause harm to the townspeople's health was not directly expressed. It was a side effect of his primary action, not his primary intent. While the actions of Bob did lead to harm, it wasn't his stated intention, indicating a misunderstanding between the cause and intention by the model. The model misinterpreted the fact that an action leading to a particular outcome does not necessarily represent the intention behind that action. 

For Improving the Prompt:
1. Elaborate on the concept of direct and indirect causation with specific references to actions and inactions both potentially contributing to the outcomes.
2. Clarify the difference between an action leading to an outcome and the intention behind the action.
3. Include guidance about evaluating the explicit vs. implicit objectives behind an action.
4. Emphasize that the absence of an action, under certain conditions, can also be causative.
5. Define clearly that the causality should also consider intentional and unintentional outcomes.
6. Ask the model to understand the specific context of every situation rather than making assumptions based on generalized rules.
7. Highlight the importance of evaluating all conditions leading to an event, not just the most immediate or obvious ones.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Incorrect Example:
The model's response to the question "Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?" is <answer>(B) No</answer>. However, the correct answer should be (A) Yes.

Explanation:
The question asks whether Wayne's decision to not move the device is the reason the device got fully charged or not. The condition for the device to be fully charged requires it to be both plugged in and on the charging pad. Since Wayne checked and confirmed its position on the charging pad and didn't move it, his inaction indirectly led to the device getting charged. This is an instance of indirect causation, where lack of action was also a contributing factor. The model may have misinterpreted the prompt's instruction to "Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event" and focused on the physical actions only (which in this case was the act of plugging in), overlooking the significance of inaction (leaving the device on the pad). 

<2>
Incorrect Example:
The model's response to the question "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?" is <answer>(A) Yes</answer>. However, the correct answer should be (B) No.

Explanation: 
This case presents a challenge over the attribution of intentions. Bobâ€™s primary intention was to rob the bank and gather as much money as possible. His intent to cause harm to the townspeople's health was not directly expressed. It was a side effect of his primary action, not his primary intent. While the actions of Bob did lead to harm, it wasn't his stated intention, indicating a misunderstanding between the cause and intention by the model. The model misinterpreted the fact that an action leading to a particular outcome does not necessarily represent the intention behind that action. 

For Improving the Prompt:
1. Elaborate on the concept of direct and indirect causation with specific references to actions and inactions both potentially contributing to the outcomes.
2. Clarify the difference between an action leading to an outcome and the intention behind the action.
3. Include guidance about evaluating the explicit vs. implicit objectives behind an action.
4. Emphasize that the absence of an action, under certain conditions, can also be causative.
5. Define clearly that the causality should also consider intentional and unintentional outcomes.
6. Ask the model to understand the specific context of every situation rather than making assumptions based on generalized rules.
7. Highlight the importance of evaluating all conditions leading to an event, not just the most immediate or obvious ones.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, it is crucial to understand the chronological series of events and the significance of each event in leading to the end result. Comprehend the inferences of conditional statements for cause and effect and how multiple factors might contribute to an event. Carefully consider all stages or events, prioritizing the temporal sequence, especially when multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur. Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome. Examine each situation based on its unique context and avoid generalizing causal rules. Lastly, be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure a deep understanding of the chain of events in a chronological order and their roles in the final outcome. Think critically about conditional statements to understand how cause and effect relationships are indicated. When examining an event, evaluate the multiple factors that may be intertwined, particularly when multiple conditions must be met separately for the outcome to happen. Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event, as every preceding incident is potentially part of the causative chain. Treat each situation as unique and avoid generalizing causal rules. Do not understate the significance of a certain event or condition just because it did not cause the outcome by itself. A cause can be part of a set of conditions leading to an event, without being solely responsible for it. Understand the dependencies among different events and conditions, ensuring each one is given due consideration in the cause ascription.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils from the box, leaving none for the polar bear. The hedgehog's lack of knowledge about the new rule regarding pencil use does not directly contribute to the polar bear not having any pencils left. Therefore, the hedgehog is not the cause of the problem.

A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the car crash cause Mr. Wallace's death?

Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is off. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's off. So, he changes the position of knob A to the on position. Because the building will implode if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom changed the position of knob A?

<1> 
In this case, the model conflates the moral culpability in the scenario with the causal contribution. Although the hedgehog technically did contribute to the depletion of pencils which led to polar bear not being able to do his homework (so the technically correct answer should be yes), the model perhaps saw the hedgehog being oblivious about the rule which may have led it to perceive that the hedgehog is not the cause of the problem.

<2>
Here, the model doesn't seem to interpret the fact that having both wires touch the battery at the same time is crucial for the short-circuit. It attributed the cause to the black wire only, as it is designated to touch the battery, whereas the correct answer lies in the fact that if only the black wire had touched the battery, it wouldn't cause a short circuit.

<3>
In this example, the model failed to consider both poison and car crash as dual causes of Mr. Wallace's death. It has possibly looked at the fact about lethal dose of poison in the blood and taken it as the single cause of death, missing the apparent cause, which is the car crash.

<4>
The model seems not to have understood that despite Ned changing the position of the motor, the motorboat would have started with the gear being in neutral itself. It has incorrectly attributed the cause to the act of Ned putting the motor in the lock position.

<5>
Similar to example 4, the model missed the fact that the building would've imploded at 5:00 PM as a consequence of the safety switch being off, regardless of Tom changing the position of knob A.

Improvement suggestions for the prompt:
- The model should consider all causal factors and not merely the last in the sequence of events.
- The prompt should stress on discrete causality even in case of multiple elements leading to the result.
- It should include internal rules to handle moral dilemmas or potential bias in causality.
- It needs to better evaluate the role of each condition in a chain of events.
- The prompt could include instructions to evaluate counterfactual situations (i.e., considering what would have happened if certain elements were removed or altered).
- The prompt should emphasize more on looking at the specific conditions that must be met for an outcome to occur, and how they interrelate. It should ask the model to assess whether the outcome could still occur without certain factors.
- The model should understand that multiple causes can contribute to an event. It should be taught the principal of plural causality. The prompt might need to reinforce this understanding.
- The prompt could be designed to focus on the significance of each factor, not just their sequence or the presence of certain variables.

When examining an event, evaluate the multiple factors that may be intertwined, particularly when multiple conditions must be met separately for the outcome to happen. Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event, as every preceding incident is potentially part of the causative chain. Treat each situation as unique and avoid generalizing causal rules. Do not understate the significance of a certain event or condition just because it did not cause the outcome by itself. A cause can be part of a set of conditions leading to an event, without being solely responsible for it. Understand the dependencies among different events and conditions, ensuring each one is given due consideration in the cause ascription. Once you have scrutinized the interdependent association among events, form your answer. Remember, causality may be a result of a combination of factors, rather than an isolated event. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by focusing solely on the fact that the black wire touched the battery, as that is the wire designated to touch it. They may overlook the condition that both the black and red wires need to touch the battery simultaneously for a short circuit to occur. Therefore, they may attribute the cause of the short circuit to the black wire touching the battery. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the car crash cause Mr. Wallace's death?

Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is not in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He changes its position, and he puts it in the lock position.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is off. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's off. So, he changes the position of knob A to the on position. Because the building will implode if either the safety switch is off or knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom changed the position of knob A?

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this case, the model conflates the moral culpability in the scenario with the causal contribution. Although the hedgehog technically did contribute to the depletion of pencils which led to polar bear not being able to do his homework (so the technically correct answer should be yes), the model perhaps saw the hedgehog being oblivious about the rule which may have led it to perceive that the hedgehog is not the cause of the problem.

<2>
Here, the model doesn't seem to interpret the fact that having both wires touch the battery at the same time is crucial for the short-circuit. It attributed the cause to the black wire only, as it is designated to touch the battery, whereas the correct answer lies in the fact that if only the black wire had touched the battery, it wouldn't cause a short circuit.

<3>
In this example, the model failed to consider both poison and car crash as dual causes of Mr. Wallace's death. It has possibly looked at the fact about lethal dose of poison in the blood and taken it as the single cause of death, missing the apparent cause, which is the car crash.

<4>
The model seems not to have understood that despite Ned changing the position of the motor, the motorboat would have started with the gear being in neutral itself. It has incorrectly attributed the cause to the act of Ned putting the motor in the lock position.

<5>
Similar to example 4, the model missed the fact that the building would've imploded at 5:00 PM as a consequence of the safety switch being off, regardless of Tom changing the position of knob A.

Improvement suggestions for the prompt:
- The model should consider all causal factors and not merely the last in the sequence of events.
- The prompt should stress on discrete causality even in case of multiple elements leading to the result.
- It should include internal rules to handle moral dilemmas or potential bias in causality.
- It needs to better evaluate the role of each condition in a chain of events.
- The prompt could include instructions to evaluate counterfactual situations (i.e., considering what would have happened if certain elements were removed or altered).
- The prompt should emphasize more on looking at the specific conditions that must be met for an outcome to occur, and how they interrelate. It should ask the model to assess whether the outcome could still occur without certain factors.
- The model should understand that multiple causes can contribute to an event. It should be taught the principal of plural causality. The prompt might need to reinforce this understanding.
- The prompt could be designed to focus on the significance of each factor, not just their sequence or the presence of certain variables.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, it is crucial to understand the chronological series of events and the significance of each event in leading to the end result. Comprehend the inferences of conditional statements for cause and effect and how multiple factors might contribute to an event. Carefully consider all stages or events, prioritizing the temporal sequence, especially when multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur. Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome. Examine each situation based on its unique context and avoid generalizing causal rules. Lastly, be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes.

<START> When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure you thoroughly analyze the chain of events and their specific role in the final outcome. Chronicle the events according to their temporal order and evaluate the various factors that might be interconnected, especially when separate conditions need to be fulfilled for the event to occur. Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event as potential contributors to the end result. View each situation in its unique context and steer clear of overgeneralizing causal rules across different scenarios. Remember, a certain event or condition may still play a significant role in the overall causality even if it does not single-handedly trigger the outcome. Always consider the case where a cause might only be one amongst a set of conditions that lead to an event. Acknowledge the relational dependencies amongst different events and conditions. Ensure each individual element in the causative chain is weighted appropriately in the attribution of cause. Consider what-if scenarios to reassess the role of individual factors. Once your analysis of the interconnections between events and the potential counterfactual scenarios is complete, form your answer. Bear in mind that causality may be established by a blend of factors and not an isolated event.

A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> The model might have gotten the answer wrong because in the prompt it focuses on not attribituting the cause to merely the latest event, which might have led the model to assume that Billy did not cause the motion detector to go off because Suzy was also there. However, the requirement for the motion detector was that it needed at least one person to be triggered. Therefore, both Billy and Suzy were causal factors in the setting off of the motion detector.

<2> In the second question, the model might have been led astray by the prompt's emphasis on not just looking at a single event, but the whole chain of events. As a result, it may have incorrectly assumed that the hedgehog didnâ€™t cause the problem because it wasn't solely responsible for taking away all the pencils. But in fact, the hedgehog did cause the problem in the context of the question, as it directly contributed to the unavailability of pencils.

<3> The third question seems to have been muddled by the prompt's exhortation to examine multiple intertwined factors and conditions. While it is true that changing the dryer's setting contributed to drying the clothes in sixty minutes, the clothes would have dried even without David changing the setting because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, making David's intervention redundant in achieving the final outcome.

<4> In the fourth question, the model may have been influenced by the prompt's direction not to undervalue the role of a certain event or condition despite it not causing the outcome by itself. Although it's true that both Janet and Kate didn't oil the machine, Kate wasn't primarily responsible, so her inaction cannot be directly assigned as the cause for the machine breakdown.

Improvements:
1. Include more explicit instructions about understanding and evaluating sufficiency conditions, and differentiate them from necessary conditions. This could help the model understand the different elements of causation.
2. Highlight the importance of taking into account the rules provided in the scenario. For example, the technicalities of responsibility and explicit rules given in the scenarios which the model seems to be currently missing out on.
3. Emphasize that the aim is not only to describe the causation chain, but to identify the direct cause asked in the question.
4. Make sure the model takes into account the question's exact wording and what it is asking for. It should not ascribe more or less causality than indicated in the presented circumstances.
5. Detail that causality does not always equate to responsibility or blame, depending on the provided context.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was present when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog knew about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
The hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem was caused by the bear and the hedgehog taking all the pencils from the box, leaving none for the polar bear to use. The hedgehog's actions were part of a series of events that led to the outcome, but it was not solely responsible for the problem.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Janet is an employee in a factory. Since she works in the maintenance department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. It is her responsibility to put oil into the machines. Kate is also an employee at the factory. While she works in the human resources department, she knows how to grease and oil all of the machines in the factory. If Janet does not put oil in the machines, it is not Kate's responsibility to do so. One day, Janet forgets to put oil in an important machine. Kate noticed that Janet did not put oil in the machine, and Kate also did not put oil in the machine. The machine broke down a few days later. Did Kate not putting oil in the machine cause it to break down?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> The model might have gotten the answer wrong because in the prompt it focuses on not attribituting the cause to merely the latest event, which might have led the model to assume that Billy did not cause the motion detector to go off because Suzy was also there. However, the requirement for the motion detector was that it needed at least one person to be triggered. Therefore, both Billy and Suzy were causal factors in the setting off of the motion detector.

<2> In the second question, the model might have been led astray by the prompt's emphasis on not just looking at a single event, but the whole chain of events. As a result, it may have incorrectly assumed that the hedgehog didnâ€™t cause the problem because it wasn't solely responsible for taking away all the pencils. But in fact, the hedgehog did cause the problem in the context of the question, as it directly contributed to the unavailability of pencils.

<3> The third question seems to have been muddled by the prompt's exhortation to examine multiple intertwined factors and conditions. While it is true that changing the dryer's setting contributed to drying the clothes in sixty minutes, the clothes would have dried even without David changing the setting because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, making David's intervention redundant in achieving the final outcome.

<4> In the fourth question, the model may have been influenced by the prompt's direction not to undervalue the role of a certain event or condition despite it not causing the outcome by itself. Although it's true that both Janet and Kate didn't oil the machine, Kate wasn't primarily responsible, so her inaction cannot be directly assigned as the cause for the machine breakdown.

Improvements:
1. Include more explicit instructions about understanding and evaluating sufficiency conditions, and differentiate them from necessary conditions. This could help the model understand the different elements of causation.
2. Highlight the importance of taking into account the rules provided in the scenario. For example, the technicalities of responsibility and explicit rules given in the scenarios which the model seems to be currently missing out on.
3. Emphasize that the aim is not only to describe the causation chain, but to identify the direct cause asked in the question.
4. Make sure the model takes into account the question's exact wording and what it is asking for. It should not ascribe more or less causality than indicated in the presented circumstances.
5. Detail that causality does not always equate to responsibility or blame, depending on the provided context.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, it is crucial to understand the chronological series of events and the significance of each event in leading to the end result. Comprehend the inferences of conditional statements for cause and effect and how multiple factors might contribute to an event. Carefully consider all stages or events, prioritizing the temporal sequence, especially when multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur. Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome. Examine each situation based on its unique context and avoid generalizing causal rules. Lastly, be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes.

<START>When answering questions about causation, it is vital to follow a detailed understanding of the sequence of events, considering all possible factors that might influence the final outcome. Pay attention to conditional statements to discern how interactions between cause and effect are indicated. Always consider that an outcome could be the result of multiple conditions or events that are interconnected. It is crucial to understand that an event's cause isn't always the most recent eventâ€”every event leading up to the final outcome potentially plays a role in the causal chain. Avoid attributing primary causation to a single event if multiple conditions must independently occur for an outcome, and do not underestimate the role of a certain event or condition just because it might not have independently produced the outcome. Simultaneously, analyze the role of sufficiency conditions alongside necessary conditions and examine contexts where a cause may contribute to an outcome without being the sole determinant. Assess each situation within its specific context, bearing in mind the principles guiding the scenario, and resist overgeneralizing cause-effect relationships. Remember, responsibility for causation might not align directly with the cause; hence, consider the significance and role of the asked subject in the presented scenario. With this comprehensive analysis, develop your answer considering every chaining event and causal relationship, but focus on the direct cause asked in the question.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM was a necessary condition for the circuit breaker to fail, as the condition stated that if four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. However, Jim's action alone was not sufficient to cause the circuit breaker to fail. It was the combination of Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turning on their lamps at the same time that led to the failure of the circuit breaker. Therefore, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM was a contributing factor but not the sole cause of the circuit breaker failure.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by saying that Billy did cause the motion detector to go off because he arrived in the room at the same time as Suzy, triggering the detector. However, upon further analysis, it can be seen that both Billy and Suzy were instructed by the boss to arrive at 9 am, making it a necessary condition for the motion detector to go off. Therefore, both Billy and Suzy's actions collectively caused the motion detector to go off.

Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is not subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and she sees that she is not. So, she changes her subscription status, and she subscribes to the email list.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the prompt seems to push the model towards a careful analysis of causation that excessively leans toward separating individual factors rather than assessing their combinative impact. The model identifies that Jim turning on his lamp was a necessary condition for the circuit breaker to fail and recognizes it as a contributing factor. However, it seems to interpret the prompt instruction of considering every preceding event individually and not defaulting to the latest event, as dismissing Jim as a directly responsible party. While it correctly recognizes that the collective use of lamps led to the failure, it nevertheless chooses (B) No, indicating that it does not attribute Jim's breaking of rules to being part of the cause.

Wrong Example 2:
In the second example, the model is again led away from recognizing Billy as a cause in the triggering of the motion detector due to the instructions in the prompt. Interpreting "Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event" led it to attribute the triggering to both Billy and Suzy, and not seeing Billy as a sole cause. However, the question asked if Billy is a cause and not if he solely caused the event, which seems to have been confused by the model. 

Wrong Example 3:
The model got the third example wrong possibly due to the complex structure of the prompt. The guidelines in the prompt can be confusing and may have led the model to ignore the primary cause (changing subscription status) and focus more on the interconnected factors. Laurie's subscription to the email list was crucial and the model missed this.

Improvements to prompt:
1. Clear instructions around considering individual versus collective causes: The prompt should better emphasize that while considering individual factors is important, there can be occasions where their collective action or a single action can be the direct cause of the event.
2. Clarification on latest event: The prompt could clarify that the latest event shouldn't always be discounted as a distracting factor, and that it could still have a significant causal role.
3. Simplification of guidelines: The prompt's complexity could be reduced. This could help the model focus better on the main causal factors within questions.
4. Reinforcing the relational dependencies: It might be useful to make the model focus more on the relational dependencies between events, as they play a vital role in causation. The model needs to be instructed to understand the difference between a cause and the sole cause.
5. Increasing emphasis on counterfactuals: When the model is guided to consider "what-if" scenarios, it allows better insight into the true causes behind an event. This aspect could be given more weight in the instructions.

The model's input is:
When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure you thoroughly analyze the chain of events and their specific role in the final outcome. Chronicle the events according to their temporal order and evaluate the various factors that might be interconnected, especially when separate conditions need to be fulfilled for the event to occur. Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event as potential contributors to the end result. View each situation in its unique context and steer clear of overgeneralizing causal rules across different scenarios. Remember, a certain event or condition may still play a significant role in the overall causality even if it does not single-handedly trigger the outcome. Always consider the case where a cause might only be one amongst a set of conditions that lead to an event. Acknowledge the relational dependencies amongst different events and conditions. Ensure each individual element in the causative chain is weighted appropriately in the attribution of cause. Consider what-if scenarios to reassess the role of individual factors.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM was a necessary condition for the circuit breaker to fail, as the condition stated that if four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. However, Jim's action alone was not sufficient to cause the circuit breaker to fail. It was the combination of Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy all turning on their lamps at the same time that led to the failure of the circuit breaker. Therefore, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM was a contributing factor but not the sole cause of the circuit breaker failure.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Suzy and Billy are working on a project that is very important for our nation's security. The boss tells them both: "Be sure that you are here at exactly 9 am. It is absolutely essential that you arrive at that time." Both Billy and Suzy arrive at 9 am. As it happens, there was a motion detector installed in the room where they arrived. The motion detector was set up to be triggered if more than one person appeared in the room at the same time. So the motion detector went off. Did Billy cause the motion detector to go off?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by saying that Billy did cause the motion detector to go off because he arrived in the room at the same time as Suzy, triggering the detector. However, upon further analysis, it can be seen that both Billy and Suzy were instructed by the boss to arrive at 9 am, making it a necessary condition for the motion detector to go off. Therefore, both Billy and Suzy's actions collectively caused the motion detector to go off.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Laurie likes GC brand coffee. GC is doing a new promotion for their new coffee flavor where customers can receive a free sample. Customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list. Laurie has previously purchased coffee beans from GC, and she is not subscribed to the GC email list. When she hears about the promotion, Laurie checks to see if she is subscribed to the email list, and she sees that she is not. So, she changes her subscription status, and she subscribes to the email list. Because customers will receive a free sample if both they have previously purchased coffee beans from GC and they are subscribed to the GC email list, Laurie receives a free sample. Did Laurie receive a free sample because she changed her subscription status?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the prompt seems to push the model towards a careful analysis of causation that excessively leans toward separating individual factors rather than assessing their combinative impact. The model identifies that Jim turning on his lamp was a necessary condition for the circuit breaker to fail and recognizes it as a contributing factor. However, it seems to interpret the prompt instruction of considering every preceding event individually and not defaulting to the latest event, as dismissing Jim as a directly responsible party. While it correctly recognizes that the collective use of lamps led to the failure, it nevertheless chooses (B) No, indicating that it does not attribute Jim's breaking of rules to being part of the cause.

Wrong Example 2:
In the second example, the model is again led away from recognizing Billy as a cause in the triggering of the motion detector due to the instructions in the prompt. Interpreting "Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event" led it to attribute the triggering to both Billy and Suzy, and not seeing Billy as a sole cause. However, the question asked if Billy is a cause and not if he solely caused the event, which seems to have been confused by the model. 

Wrong Example 3:
The model got the third example wrong possibly due to the complex structure of the prompt. The guidelines in the prompt can be confusing and may have led the model to ignore the primary cause (changing subscription status) and focus more on the interconnected factors. Laurie's subscription to the email list was crucial and the model missed this.

Improvements to prompt:
1. Clear instructions around considering individual versus collective causes: The prompt should better emphasize that while considering individual factors is important, there can be occasions where their collective action or a single action can be the direct cause of the event.
2. Clarification on latest event: The prompt could clarify that the latest event shouldn't always be discounted as a distracting factor, and that it could still have a significant causal role.
3. Simplification of guidelines: The prompt's complexity could be reduced. This could help the model focus better on the main causal factors within questions.
4. Reinforcing the relational dependencies: It might be useful to make the model focus more on the relational dependencies between events, as they play a vital role in causation. The model needs to be instructed to understand the difference between a cause and the sole cause.
5. Increasing emphasis on counterfactuals: When the model is guided to consider "what-if" scenarios, it allows better insight into the true causes behind an event. This aspect could be given more weight in the instructions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, it is crucial to understand the chronological series of events and the significance of each event in leading to the end result. Comprehend the inferences of conditional statements for cause and effect and how multiple factors might contribute to an event. Carefully consider all stages or events, prioritizing the temporal sequence, especially when multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur. Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome. Examine each situation based on its unique context and avoid generalizing causal rules. Lastly, be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure a deep understanding of the chain of events in a chronological order and their roles in the final outcome. Think critically about conditional statements to understand how cause and effect relationships are indicated. When examining an event, evaluate the multiple factors that may be intertwined, particularly when multiple conditions must be met separately for the outcome to happen. Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event, as every preceding incident is potentially part of the causative chain. Treat each situation as unique and avoid generalizing causal rules. Do not understate the significance of a certain event or condition just because it did not cause the outcome by itself. A cause can be part of a set of conditions leading to an event, without being solely responsible for it. Understand the dependencies among different events and conditions, ensuring each one is given due consideration in the cause ascription. Once you have scrutinized the interdependent association among events, form your answer. Remember, causality may be a result of a combination of factors, rather than an isolated event. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Lack of clarity about shared causality: The original prompt might lead the model to consider only single-handed or primary causes. Billy and Suzy's simultaneous actions both contribute to the deletion of emails, but since the question refers only to Suzy, the model may misinterpret and assume that Suzy doesn't cause it alone. To avoid this, the prompt should be explicit that multiple parties can share causality.

2) Absence of emphasis on policy's role: The prompt doesn't direct the model to factor in the role of company policy. The policy allowing Billy and Suzy to log in simultaneously is also a contributing cause. The model should see that even in the absence of Suzy's action, Billy's alone could have also caused the event, suggesting shared causality.

3) Signal for unexpected consequences: The model might not appreciate the significance of no one in the company knowing about the deletion problem. This refers to an unexpected consequence, which is another kind of causation. The prompt could indicate that not all causes may be known to the actors involved, and their ignorance of the cause doesn't exclude them from causing the result.

4) Misinterpretation of roles: The model might think that since Suzy didn't delete the emails directly, she's not the cause. The prompt could highlight that causality isn't limited to direct effects; one's action may indirectly cause the outcome by triggering a chain of events.

Improvements for the prompt:

1) Add language stressing that multiple actors can share causality for a given outcome.
2) Highlight that actions not directly causing but leading to the event can still be causal.
3) Point out that the role of policies, rules, or guidelines should also be considered in causal attribution.
4) Emphasize that ignorance of a causal relationship doesn't remove one's causal relationship.
5) Indicate that unexpected consequences are also a part of causal attribution.

Do not understate the significance of a certain event or condition just because it did not cause the outcome by itself. A cause can be part of a set of conditions leading to an event, without being solely responsible for it. Understand the dependencies among different events and conditions, ensuring each one is given due consideration in the cause ascription. Once you have scrutinized the interdependent association among events, form your answer. Remember, causality may be a result of a combination of factors, rather than an isolated event. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure you thoroughly analyze the chain of events and their specific role in the final outcome. Chronicle the events according to their temporal order and evaluate the various factors that might be interconnected, especially when separate conditions need to be fulfilled for the event to occur. Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event as potential contributors to the end result. View each situation in its unique context and steer clear of overgeneralizing causal rules across different scenarios. Remember, a certain event or condition may still play a significant role in the overall causality even if it does not single-handedly trigger the outcome. Always consider the case where a cause might only be one amongst a set of conditions that lead to an event. Acknowledge the relational dependencies amongst different events and conditions. Ensure each individual element in the causative chain is weighted appropriately in the attribution of cause. Consider what-if scenarios to reassess the role of individual factors. Once your analysis of the interconnections between events and the potential counterfactual scenarios is complete, form your answer. Bear in mind that causality may be established by a blend of factors and not an isolated event. After forming your judgment, present your answer to the causation question, bracketing it within <answer> and </answer>.

<START> When answering questions about causal attribution, it's crucial to delve into the chain of events and their individual roles in the final outcome. Arrange the events in their chronological order and evaluate the potential interconnections, particularly when separate conditions have to be met for the event to take place. Defy the tendency to view the latest event as the sole cause; conceive every prior event as potential contributors to the final result. Always interpret each situation in its unique context, avoiding generalizations across different scenarios. Remember, an event or condition may play a significant role in causality even if it doesn't trigger the outcome independently. Consider cases where a cause contributes as part of a set leading to an event rather than being solely responsible. Understand that more than one actor can often share the causality. Acknowledge policies, rules, or guidelines; their role can be as causative as actions or events. Realize that ignorance of a cause doesn't negate its effect; unknowingly activating a chain reaction still establishes causality. Factor in unexpected consequences, as they also form part of causal attribution. Recognize the interdependencies amongst various events and conditions, assigning apt weightage to each in the attribution of cause. Imagine the implications of what-if scenarios to evaluate the role of individual elements differently. Once your analysis of events, dependencies, counterfactuals is complete, formulate your answer. Keep in mind that several factors, together or separately, can establish causality; it doesn't exclusively hinge on isolated events. Frame your answer to the causation question within <answer> and </answer>, mindful of all aspects of causal analysis. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?

Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing dangerous viruses are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing dangerous viruses are deleted from the central computer.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1> Wrong Example One:
In this case, the model seems to have followed the majority of the prompt instructions about understanding the events chain chronologically and evaluating all parts of the scenario. The question was about whether John's job caused his premature death, to which the model replied, "Yes".

Analysis:
a) The model might have overemphasized on the early condition of John working in plastics division and getting exposed to asbestos that caused lung cancer. Given that the question was about the 'premature' death, the model failed to acknowledge the immediate event of the wrong medication, which was the direct and immediate cause of death.
b) It seems the model did not apply the principle of not "defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause", in a different direction, wherein it failed to identify the final event as a significant cause in this case.
c) This might be due to overapplication of the instruction to consider long term events and to not attribute the cause to a single later event.
d) The model needs a more nuanced understanding of the story and clear semantic understanding of 'direct cause' vs 'underlying conditions'.

2> Wrong Example Two:
The model was not able to recognize Suzy's contribution in the event chain - i.e., logging into the central computer, which together with Billy's logged-in status, led to the deletion of some virus-laden emails. 

Analysis:
a) The model seems to not have adequately considered the cumulative effect of actions in this scenario - both Billy and Suzy logged in together lead to the desired result.
b) It seems the model did not adequately take into account the combined effect of both agents' actions (Billy and Suzy), which were fundamentally necessary for the resulting event, or causal criterion wherein 'a cause might only be one amongst a set of conditions that lead to an event'.

Suggestions to Improve Prompt:
1) Make explicit instruction for the model to consider and weigh 'immediate' or 'direct' causes versus 'background' or 'underlying' conditions based on the context of the question.
2) Ensure that the model takes into account not just chronology but the nature of causes such as 'sufficient', 'necessary', 'contributing', and 'proximate' in attribution.
3) Emphasize more on understanding the role of individual or combined actions/events in a causative chain.
4) Instructions to consider the explicit and implicit effects of all actors involved in a scenario, and analyse their involvement as a potential contributing factor to the final outcome.
5) Include instructions on dealing with the nuances of time and immediate vs long-term causality.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event, understand conditional statements and their implications for cause and effect, and take into account all stages/events before determining causality. Don't always focus on the latest or final event as the only cause. Could there be other contributing factors? Be cognizant of the dependencies and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. Finally, compose your answer choice by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) When answering questions about causal attribution, it is crucial to understand the chronological series of events and the significance of each event in leading to the end result. Comprehend the inferences of conditional statements for cause and effect and how multiple factors might contribute to an event. Carefully consider all stages or events, prioritizing the temporal sequence, especially when multiple conditions must be individually satisfied for the event to occur. Do not overemphasize the most recent event as the sole cause; every preceding event or action may have a role in causing the final outcome. Examine each situation based on its unique context and avoid generalizing causal rules. Lastly, be mindful of dependencies among events and conditions ensuring each is interpreted correctly when assigning causes. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure a deep understanding of the chain of events in a chronological order and their roles in the final outcome. Think critically about conditional statements to understand how cause and effect relationships are indicated. When examining an event, evaluate the multiple factors that may be intertwined, particularly when multiple conditions must be met separately for the outcome to happen. Avoid attributing the cause to merely the latest event, as every preceding incident is potentially part of the causative chain. Treat each situation as unique and avoid generalizing causal rules. Do not understate the significance of a certain event or condition just because it did not cause the outcome by itself. A cause can be part of a set of conditions leading to an event, without being solely responsible for it. Understand the dependencies among different events and conditions, ensuring each one is given due consideration in the cause ascription. Once you have scrutinized the interdependent association among events, form your answer. Remember, causality may be a result of a combination of factors, rather than an isolated event. Ultimately, provide your answer to the causation question, enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure you thoroughly analyze the chain of events and their specific role in the final outcome. Chronicle the events according to their temporal order and evaluate the various factors that might be interconnected, especially when separate conditions need to be fulfilled for the event to occur. Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event as potential contributors to the end result. View each situation in its unique context and steer clear of overgeneralizing causal rules across different scenarios. Remember, a certain event or condition may still play a significant role in the overall causality even if it does not single-handedly trigger the outcome. Always consider the case where a cause might only be one amongst a set of conditions that lead to an event. Acknowledge the relational dependencies amongst different events and conditions. Ensure each individual element in the causative chain is weighted appropriately in the attribution of cause. Consider what-if scenarios to reassess the role of individual factors. Once your analysis of the interconnections between events and the potential counterfactual scenarios is complete, form your answer. Bear in mind that causality may be established by a blend of factors and not an isolated event. After forming your judgment, present your answer to the causation question, bracketing it within <answer> and </answer>.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> When tackling queries about causal attribution, delve deeply into the sequence of events and their distinctive contribution to the end result. Detail the events in their order of occurrence and assess the comprehensive range of variables involved, particularly when separate conditions must be satisfied for the event to ensue. Resist attributing the entire cause to only the recent event; consider each preceding event as potential factors contributing to the outcome. Be mindful of the context of each situation to avoid overgeneralizations in causality rules across different scenarios. Remember that an event or condition may still have a substantial impact on the overall causality even if it doesn't independently trigger the outcome. Always review the potential scenario of an individual cause among a series of conditions leading to an event. Acknowledge the interconnected relationship among different events and conditions. Apply adequate weight to each component in the causative chain while attributing cause. Consider alternate 'what-if' scenarios to reassess the role of singular elements and analyze the difference between immediate, proximate or direct causes and long-term causes based on the explicit question context. Once your examination of the links between events, potential counterfactual situations is complete, formulate your answer. Be aware of the fact that causality might be a product of a combination of conditions and not just a single event. Understanding the nuances of the complexity of cause and effect relationships is key in any scenario. Appraise the involvement of all implicated parties in a situation and analyze their potential contribution to the final outcome, including cumulative effects of multiple actors' actions. After making your judgement, deliver your answer to the causation query, placing it within <answer> and </answer>. <END>

Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 11 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very unlikely that he will roll higher than 11, but the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so amazingly, he rolled greater than 11. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's win was directly caused by both the coin flip and the dice roll. The conditions for winning the game were that the total of his dice roll had to be greater than 11 AND the coin had to come up heads. Since both conditions were met (he rolled a 12 and the coin came up heads), Alex won the game. Therefore, the correct answer is:

Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's decision to change jobs cause his premature death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, John's decision to change jobs from the woodwork division to the plastics division ultimately led to his exposure to asbestos, which directly caused his lung cancer. The exposure to asbestos fibers in the plastics division was a significant factor in the development of his highly progressed and incurable lung cancer. Therefore, John's decision to switch jobs can be considered a direct cause of his premature death.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
In a particular building there are two businesses, a travel agency and a graphic design studio. The building's climate control system is a new design that saves energy by keeping track of the number of people in the building, and only turning on when enough people have entered the building. The climate control system will turn on when the people who work at the travel agency or the people who work in the design studio arrive for work. Each office has enough employees to turn on the climate control system on their own. The travel agency employees almost always arrive at 8:45am, but the design studio employees almost always arrive at 10 am. Today, the travel agency employees arrived at 8:45 am. Unexpectedly, the design studio employees also arrived at 8:45 am to meet a deadline. So, today, the climate control system turned on at 8:45 am. Did the design studio agents cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The design studio employees arriving at 8:45 am did cause the climate control system to turn on at 8:45 am. The system is designed to turn on when a sufficient number of people enter the building, and both the travel agency and design studio have enough employees to trigger the system on their own. Since the design studio employees arrived earlier than usual and in enough numbers to activate the system, their arrival directly led to the system turning on at 8:45 am.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example (Alex's game):
In this example, the model wrongly credits the coin flip for Alexâ€™s victory. However, the coin flip and dice roll co-dependently led to the win because both conditions were stated as necessary prerequisites. The reason why the prediction is wrong might be that the model didn't grasp that the challenge was to isolate the cause of victory and didn't consider that the coin flip is a condition that occurs equally frequently and probabilistically independent of any other variable, unlike the dice roll. The encrypted direct cause was the dice roll, which was an unlikely and statistically more substantial event. 

<2> Wrong Example (Johnâ€™s death):
The model attributes his premature death to his decision to switch jobs. However, the real immediate cause of his death was the accidental wrongful medication, not the underlying condition. The model didn't sufficiently value the isolated direct cause imposed by the question, and was overly focused on the larger background situation, thereby missing the importance of the last intervention which directly caused his demise.

<3> Wrong Example (climate control system):
Again, the model insists on the direct cause being the arrival of the design studio employees, but the point here is that even if the design studio agents didn't come early, the air conditioning would have switched on anyways because of the travel agents' presence. The model became too focused on direct causes and overlooked the actual independent variable that led the system to turn on. 

Improvements:

1. The prompt can be enhanced by specifying that the model should extract not just the immediate causation but the distinctive, non-redundant variable in the storyline that defines the cause in specific. 
2. The prompt might underestimate models' difficulty to understand nuances like conditional probabilities and independent influences, which should be emphasized.
3. Also, it could be stressed that obtaining the correct answer might depend on understanding indirect or less obvious reasons.
4. Use examples to specify that it's needed to understand the context too, understanding each event independently and as part of a causal sequence, and recognizing the triggers of terminal events.
5. An additional reminder to consider the principles of correlation and causation could be beneficial. It should be clearly stated that the model needs to identify the immediate or most closely linked cause of the outcome rather than a contributing or indirect factor.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet could possibly hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The man intentionally shot the bird-watcher. This can be inferred from the fact that he was aware of the presence of the bird-watchers and the potential consequences of his actions, but chose to shoot the deer regardless. His primary goal was to win the competition, and he was willing to take the risk of harming the bird-watchers in order to achieve that goal. Therefore, the man intentionally shot the bird-watcher.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> In this example, the model has made an incorrect interpretation of the causation. The prompt asks the model to determine the causation while considering both direct and indirect influences which can sometimes lead the model to make false assumptions about intent depending on the nature of the scenario provided. The scenario clearly states that the hunter did not care about the birdwatchers, his only intent was to kill the deer to win the competition. The key is to understand this indifference as a lack of intent towards the birdwatchers.

The prompt's wording may be leading to this incorrect inference. The request to consider both "direct and indirect influences" might be confusing the model into considering the indirect consequence (harming the bird watcher) as an intended effect. When determining causation, the model seems to consider awareness of potential consequences to equate to intent. This is incorrect because it is ignoring the specific information about the hunter's goal and intent expressed in the scenario.

In this case, while the hunter was aware of the presence of birdwatchers which led to an unfortunate incident, his primary intent was to kill the deer, not to hurt the birdwatchers. It's passive foresight, not an active intent. The error comes from the model wrongly attributing 'potential consequences' as the hunter's intention.

Potential Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Specify the consideration of distinction between intention and outcome in the evaluation of causation. The understanding of direct intent versus indirect effects should be more explicitly described in the prompt.
2. Ask the model to prioritize information provided in the scenario and weigh direct intentions more heavily than indirect consequences when determining causation.
3. Reiterate the need to show the rationale of the answer choice by having the model parse the scenario information carefully. The model should clearly distinguish between the intention and the consequences of the actions.
4. Ask the model to consider the dictionary definition of 'intentional' and frame its understanding of indirect effects in the light of this definition.
5. Ask for an explicit analysis of intent in the scenario, drawing a clear line between what was accidentally resulted and what was the actual intent.

The model's response is: 
The man intentionally shot the bird-watcher. This can be inferred from the fact that he was aware of the presence of the bird-watchers and the potential consequences of his actions, but chose to shoot the deer regardless. His primary goal was to win the competition, and he was willing to take the risk of harming the bird-watchers in order to achieve that goal. Therefore, the man intentionally shot the bird-watcher.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> In this example, the model has made an incorrect interpretation of the causation. The prompt asks the model to determine the causation while considering both direct and indirect influences which can sometimes lead the model to make false assumptions about intent depending on the nature of the scenario provided. The scenario clearly states that the hunter did not care about the birdwatchers, his only intent was to kill the deer to win the competition. The key is to understand this indifference as a lack of intent towards the birdwatchers.

The prompt's wording may be leading to this incorrect inference. The request to consider both "direct and indirect influences" might be confusing the model into considering the indirect consequence (harming the bird watcher) as an intended effect. When determining causation, the model seems to consider awareness of potential consequences to equate to intent. This is incorrect because it is ignoring the specific information about the hunter's goal and intent expressed in the scenario.

In this case, while the hunter was aware of the presence of birdwatchers which led to an unfortunate incident, his primary intent was to kill the deer, not to hurt the birdwatchers. It's passive foresight, not an active intent. The error comes from the model wrongly attributing 'potential consequences' as the hunter's intention.

Potential Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Specify the consideration of distinction between intention and outcome in the evaluation of causation. The understanding of direct intent versus indirect effects should be more explicitly described in the prompt.
2. Ask the model to prioritize information provided in the scenario and weigh direct intentions more heavily than indirect consequences when determining causation.
3. Reiterate the need to show the rationale of the answer choice by having the model parse the scenario information carefully. The model should clearly distinguish between the intention and the consequences of the actions.
4. Ask the model to consider the dictionary definition of 'intentional' and frame its understanding of indirect effects in the light of this definition.
5. Ask for an explicit analysis of intent in the scenario, drawing a clear line between what was accidentally resulted and what was the actual intent.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is not on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it's not. So, he changes the position of the device, and he puts it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne changed the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
No, the device is not fully charged because Wayne changed the position of the device. The device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for full charging. Wayne changing the position of the device simply ensured that it met the required conditions for charging, but the actual charging process was due to the device being plugged in and on the charging pad. Therefore, the correct answer is (B) No.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to help a person who was injured while exercising. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior was due to his generosity. Joe is the type of person who wants to do good things for others in need. Sometimes his friends are bothered by his seemingly excessive generosity and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized his generosity was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did Joe cause his son's injury?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Joe's actions directly led to the delay in picking up his son, which ultimately resulted in his son being injured in a car accident. Joe's decision to help the injured person in the parking lot was a direct cause of the chain of events that led to his son's injury. Additionally, Joe's personality trait of generosity played a role in his decision to stop and help the injured person, further contributing to the causation of the outcome.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In the first question, the model misunderstood the causation link within the scenario. When asked if the device was fully charged because Wayne changed the position of the device, the model interpreted this as only considering the technical process of 'charging' (being 'plugged in' and being on the 'charging pad') and overlooked the causative action taken by Wayne, which was to move the device onto the charging pad. The answer shows an over-emphasis on the mechanical process and lack of human action-oriented causation.

<2>
In the second question, the model overextended the concept of causality by assuming Joeâ€™s action of helping an injured person, which indirectly led to him not being able to pick his child, as the cause of the accident. The model failed to differentiate between a contributory factor and a direct cause, missing the fact that Joe himself didn't crash his car, but his action led his son to be in a situation where the accident occurred.

Reasons for the errors:
1. The prompt was not effective in guiding the model's reasoning. It centered on the causation but didnâ€™t specifically instruct the model to differentiate between different types of causes - direct and indirect.
2. The model was unable to accurately delineate the relationships of cause-and-effect in the scenarios. It overlooked significant human actions and choices and the effects of these on the final outcome.
3. The model failed to contextualize the complexity of social and behavioral dynamics that can determine causation in real-life situations.

Potential improvements for the prompt:
1. Specify in the prompt that the model needs to critically analyze both direct and indirect causes and identify the key cause in the scenario.
2. The model needs to be prompted to consider the roles played by both human actions and non-human factors in determining causality. 
3. Instruct the model to provide explanations about the nature of causation. This could include factors such as intentionality, preventability, and the sequence of events. 
4. The prompt should steer the model towards understanding the difference between a contributing factor and a direct cause.
5. The prompt could also consider multifaceted causation, where there are multiple contributing factors instead of a single definitive cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom has a huge garden and loves flowers. He employed two gardeners who take care of the plants on his 30 flower beds: Alex and Benni. Both can independently decide on their working hours and arrange who cares for which flower beds. Alex and Benni are very reliable and Tom is satisfied with their work. Nevertheless he wants to optimize the plant growth. Since Tom has read in a magazine that plants grow better when they are fertilized, he decides to let Alex and Benni fertilize his plants. The magazine recommends the use of the chemicals A X200R or B Y33R, since both are especially effective. However, Tom also read that it can damage plants when they are exposed to multiple different types of chemicals. Tom therefore decides that he only wants to use one fertilizer. He goes for A X200R. Tom instructs Alex and Benni to buy the chemical A X200R and to use only this fertilizer. Alex volunteers for buying several bottles of this chemical for Benni and himself. After a few weeks, Tom goes for a walk in his garden. He realizes that some of his plants are much prettier and bigger than before. However, he also realizes that some of his plants have lost their beautiful color and are dried up. That makes Tom very sad and reflective. He wonders whether the drying of his plants might have something to do with the fertilization. He wants to investigate this matter and talks to Alex and Benni. Alex tells him that he followed Tom's instructions and only bought and used the chemical A X200R. However, Benni tells him that he had used the chemical B Y33R instead. He still had some bottles of this chemical in stock at home and wanted to use them up. Tom realizes that the plants dried up in the flower beds on which both A X200R and B Y33R were applied by the gardeners. Did the fertilization by Alex cause the plant to dry out?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Problematic emphasis on the direct cause: The prompt directly instructs the language model to focus on the "direct causation" and "stated intentions and goals of the individuals". In this example, Alex followed the instructions and used the correct fertilization, which does not directly cause the plants to dry out. However, because the prompt places significant emphasis on individual involvement rather than a complex interaction of factors, the model incorrectly blamed Alex, who also fertilized the plants albeit with the correct fertilizer.

2) Misinterpretation of 'accidental' and 'intentional': Despite the prompt's instruction to differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, the model incorrectly conflated the actions of Alex and Benni. Alex's intentional action of using the proper fertilizer was incorrectly labeled as the causal effect, whereas Benni's purposeful deviation from instruction was the true cause of the issue. 

3) Lack of consideration for combined effects: The prompt doesn't guide the model sufficiently to consider the combined effects of actions. In the provided scenario, the drying out of the plants is the direct result of the combination of actions from both Alex and Benni. However, based on the current prompt, the model failed to recognize this as the actual cause.

Prompt Improvements:

1) Reframe the focus: The prompt could benefit from being more explicit in the consideration of the combined effects of multiple direct causes. 

2) Encourage more expansive interpretation: Allow the model to interpret the scenario more freely and not limit it to 'stated intentions and goals' but to consider misinterpretations, mistakes or disobedience to instructions.

3) Enhance distinction guidelines: The instructions should guide the model to more effectively differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, and to properly attribute causation to unauthorized deviations from instructions. 

Finally, it would be beneficial to explicitly instruct the model to account for actions that deviate from the provided guidelines or instructions, and to assess their potential impact on the final outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Sara has an electric guitar that she plays through an amplifier. The guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or the power mixer is turned on. Today, the amplifier is set to channel A. Sara checks to see if the power mixer is on. She sees that the power mixer is turned on, and she does not turn off the power mixer or adjust it at all. Because the guitar will play through the amplifier if either the amplifier is set to channel A or the power mixer is turned on, Sara's guitar plays through the amplifier. Did the guitar play through the amplifier because Sara did not turn off the power mixer?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, the guitar played through the amplifier because the amplifier was set to channel A, not because Sara did not turn off the power mixer. <answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this instance, the failure of the model lies in its inability to format the answer as per the instructions. It has provided the correct option in terms of content (option A is the right answer and the model mentions "(A)") but it was supposed to put the answer in "<answer>" and "</answer>", which it failed to do. 

The issue here is related to the formatting and presentation of the answer than the language model's ability to gauge the causality from the scenario presented. Instructions about answer formatting were given in the question, but not explicitly stated in the prompt. 

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the language model correctly interprets the scenario but fails to make the right causality assumption given the nature of the question. The model incorrectly assumes that because the amplifier is set to channel A, that is the only cause for the guitar to play through the amplifier. 

However, the question intriguingly puts forth that the guitar can play through the amplifier if either channel A is set or the power mixer is on. This indicates an "or" condition that denotes that either of the conditions could lead to the guitar playing through the amplifier. Therefore, even if channel A was the initial setting, Sara not turning off the power mixer can also be a cause of the event. 

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Formatting Instructions: The prompt should contain explicit instructions about formatting responses. This would rectify the problem like the one encountered in the first wrong example, where the language model provided the correct response but failed to format it appropriately.

2. Interpretation of Conditional Statements: The prompt should emphasize considering "and" and "or" conditions thoroughly. In scenarios like the second example, this could help in appropriately connecting the cause and effect, rather than attributing the effect to one cause, and ignoring another valid cause. 

3. Intent versus action: In the first scenario, the prompt might need to clarify how to handle intentions and actions. There could be cases where intention does not lead to a direct action but it still triggers a chain of actions leading to those outcomes. Definitions of intentional and unintentional should be revisited to ensure the model can correctly interpret these scenarios.

4. Emphasize to heed to the phrasing of questions: While the prompt does ask the model to parse the scenario thoroughly, it should also stress paying close attention to the phrasing and specific terms used in the questions following the scenarios. 

5. Reiteration of scenario: The prompt could instruct the model to recap the scenario to make sure the scenario is comprehended in its entirety.

6. "Either...or" conditions: The model might need additional instructions about interpreting "either...or" situations. This may help it in situations like the second scenario, where multiple conditions could result in the same effect.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Joe was about to go pick up his child from a school in the suburbs. In the parking lot, he stopped to talk with friends. Because of this delay in picking up his son, Joe's neighbor, who waited 15 min for Joe to show up, took the child home in his car. On the way home, the neighbor's car was struck by a drunk driver. Joe's son, the only seriously hurt victim, received severe leg injuries. Joe's behavior stems from his talkativeness. He is the type of person who likes to talk to anybody, at any time. Sometimes his friends are bothered by this seemingly excessive talkativeness and they even complain about it occasionally. But, after they got to know him better, they realized that Joe's talkativeness was a basic trait of his personality. Thus, it was something he could not help, even when he tried hard. Did the drunk driver cause injury to Joe's son?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the direct causation of Joe's son's injury was not the drunk driver, but Joe's talkativeness which led to the delay in picking up his child. Joe's intention was not to cause harm to his son, but his talkativeness resulted in the neighbor taking the child home, ultimately leading to the accident. The drunk driver's actions were an unintended consequence of Joe's behavior. Therefore, the answer is:

In Bash Ball, opposing teams try to score points in the other team's zone by entering it. On each team, there are two types of players: Bashers and Runners. During the game, Bashers remain in the same spot, trying to hit the other team's Runners with balls, and Runners try to enter the other team's zone without getting hit. Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is allowed to talk to Runners, Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the remainder of the game. Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was?

<1> 
In this scenario, the information about causation was not handled correctly by the language model. The model interpreted that an outcome only happens due to the intention of a person, not considering that an event can occur due to multiple factors.

Consequently, the language model concluded that Joe's son's injury was not caused by the drunk driver but, instead, it was Joe's talkativeness that led to the unfortunate accident. The model neglected the fact, that albeit Joe's talkativeness was an influencing factor for the event to occur, the drunk driver directly caused the injury and was the immediate factor leading to the son's injury.

<2> 
For this question, the language model also had a misinterpretation of causation. The language model focused too much on the concept of "direct cause" and failed to consider that actions or non-actions may lead to outcomes in a chain of events.

The language model concluded that Harmon was out because he got hit by the other team's Basher, ignoring the fact that Zach's non-disclosure of the hiding place of the other team's Basher contributed to the situation. This error can be attributed to a misunderstanding about intention and action; Zach's intention was not to help Harmon, and his non-action directly contributed to the situation where Harmon got hit. 

Based on the two examples, improvements for the prompt could include:

1. Rewording the prompt: The model seems to misunderstand direct causation, so clearer, simpler language about recognizing multiple contributing factors to an event may be necessary.

2. Including an explanation or definition of 'causation': For a more accurate understanding, include an example that explains causation is not always directly related to one person's intentions or actions.

3. Providing examples: Use clear examples that show scenarios of both 'intentional' and 'unintentional' causation. 

4. Emphasizing that absence of action can also be a cause: Whether people act or not can also lead to various outcomes, and this point needs to be underscored. 

5. Focusing more on the immediate effect: The prompt should emphasize considering the immediate or subsequent event as the direct cause, regarding the initial event as the indirect cause. 

The revised prompt could look like this:
Analyze the provided scenarios taking into account both direct and indirect causations. Consider direct causation as the immediate or subsequent event responsible for the outcome. Understand that causation can also occur from non-actions and intentional or unintentional behavior can lead to various outcomes. Provide your response with a clear explanation that includes all influential factors, differentiating intended results and unintentional outcomes. Whenever unsure, refer to dictionary meanings for 'intentional' and 'unintentional'.

Zach, Harmon and a few other friends are on a team playing Bash Ball against another team. Zach is a Basher and Harmon is a Runner. At one point in the game, Zach spots one of the other team's Bashers behind a tree. Later on, Harmon passes by Zach. Knowing that he is allowed to talk to Runners, Zach does not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher is. Soon after, the Basher that Zach spotted hits Harmon with a Bash Ball. Harmon is out for the remainder of the game. Was Harmon out of the game because Zach did not tell Harmon where the other team's Basher was?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Harmon was out of the game because he got hit by the other team's Basher, not because Zach did not tell him where the Basher was. Zach's decision not to inform Harmon was not the direct cause of Harmon getting hit. <B>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this scenario, the information about causation was not handled correctly by the language model. The model interpreted that an outcome only happens due to the intention of a person, not considering that an event can occur due to multiple factors.

Consequently, the language model concluded that Joe's son's injury was not caused by the drunk driver but, instead, it was Joe's talkativeness that led to the unfortunate accident. The model neglected the fact, that albeit Joe's talkativeness was an influencing factor for the event to occur, the drunk driver directly caused the injury and was the immediate factor leading to the son's injury.

<2> 
For this question, the language model also had a misinterpretation of causation. The language model focused too much on the concept of "direct cause" and failed to consider that actions or non-actions may lead to outcomes in a chain of events.

The language model concluded that Harmon was out because he got hit by the other team's Basher, ignoring the fact that Zach's non-disclosure of the hiding place of the other team's Basher contributed to the situation. This error can be attributed to a misunderstanding about intention and action; Zach's intention was not to help Harmon, and his non-action directly contributed to the situation where Harmon got hit. 

Based on the two examples, improvements for the prompt could include:

1. Rewording the prompt: The model seems to misunderstand direct causation, so clearer, simpler language about recognizing multiple contributing factors to an event may be necessary.

2. Including an explanation or definition of 'causation': For a more accurate understanding, include an example that explains causation is not always directly related to one person's intentions or actions.

3. Providing examples: Use clear examples that show scenarios of both 'intentional' and 'unintentional' causation. 

4. Emphasizing that absence of action can also be a cause: Whether people act or not can also lead to various outcomes, and this point needs to be underscored. 

5. Focusing more on the immediate effect: The prompt should emphasize considering the immediate or subsequent event as the direct cause, regarding the initial event as the indirect cause. 

The revised prompt could look like this:
Analyze the provided scenarios taking into account both direct and indirect causations. Consider direct causation as the immediate or subsequent event responsible for the outcome. Understand that causation can also occur from non-actions and intentional or unintentional behavior can lead to various outcomes. Provide your response with a clear explanation that includes all influential factors, differentiating intended results and unintentional outcomes. Whenever unsure, refer to dictionary meanings for 'intentional' and 'unintentional'.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Tom works for a demolition company, and today he is demolishing a building by implosion. The building will implode automatically at 5:00 PM if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on. At 4:00 PM, the safety switch is off, and knob A is on. At that time, Tom checks to see if knob A is on, and he sees that it's on. So, he does not change the position of knob A at all. Because the building would implode if both the safety switch is off and knob A is switched on, the building implodes at 5:00 PM. Did the building implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
No, the building did not implode because Tom did not change the position of knob A. The building imploded because both the safety switch was off and knob A was switched on, which were the necessary conditions for the implosion to occur. Tom's decision not to change the position of knob A did not directly cause the implosion.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a beautiful eagle perched in a tree nearby. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the sound of the gunfire will definitely cause the eagle to fly away. But he does not care at all about the eagle -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the sound of the gunfire causes the eagle to fly away. Did the man intentionally cause the eagle to fly away?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision did not cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug's effectiveness in alleviating the kidney problems. The attending doctor's decision to sign off on administering the drug, despite the hospital policy forbidding its use, may have been a contributing factor, but it was not the direct cause of the patient's recovery. The patient's recovery was more likely the result of the drug's intended effects. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question was about whether the building imploded because Tom did not change the position of knob A. The model wrongly predicted that "Tom not changing the position of knob A" did not directly cause the building to implode. However, given that both conditions (the safety switch being off and knob A being on) were required for the building to implode, it's clear that Tom's action (or inaction) played a crucial role in the building's implosion. 

The prompt was incorrectly interpreted by the model, where it considered only enacted actions, but did not consider inactions as being causative. So, the instructions might not be clear enough for the model to understand the role of inaction and its possible effects on a given scenario.

<2>
The model incorrectly interpreted that the hunter intentionally caused the eagle to fly away when he shot the deer. The decision was made entirely on the basis of winning the competition, not to cause the eagle to fly away. This is an instance where the model did not properly differentiate between incidental outcomes (the eagle flying away) and the main goal (hunting the deer).

The prompt should underscore the distinction between a side effect of a main action and a main intention. The model might have changed its answer if the question had been framed to consider not just the action, but also the main intention behind that action.

<3>
The model incorrectly concluded that the attending doctor's decision did not directly cause the patient's recovery. In this scenario, had the doctor not approved the treatment, the intern would not have been able to administer the drug. Significantly, the model erred by stating the recovery was the result of the drug's "intended effects," ignoring that the drug would not have been administered without the doctor's decision, which was the most important causal factor in the patient's recovery.

The prompt was not clear in instructing the model to consider policy and administrative decisions and their effects, leading to another case of overlooking an indirect cause. The model did not understand the scenario in its entirety, considering only the scientific aspect (drug's effect) and not the administrative or procedural aspect (doctor's decision).

To improve the prompt, the following aspects can be considered:
1. The prompt should be clear in including both "action" and "inaction" as potential causes.
2. The model should be guided towards understanding the main intended consequence and differentiating it from ancillary or incidental outcomes.
3. It should emphasize the importance of procedural and administrative decisions in determining outcomes.
4. It should stress that a cause does not have to be physically or tangibly connected to an outcome, and that indirect causes are no less significant.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The machine is designed so that both wires move around inside the machine. The black wire is supposed to touch the battery at certain times as it moves around inside the machine. The red wire is never supposed to touch the battery as it moves around inside the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both come in contact with the battery at the exact same time. There is a short circuit. Did the red wire cause the short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the machine is specifically designed to short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The black wire is intended to touch the battery at certain times, while the red wire is never supposed to touch the battery. Therefore, the intentional design of the machine dictates that the simultaneous contact of both wires with the battery would cause a short circuit. The red wire, deviating from its intended path and coming into contact with the battery, is a crucial factor in causing the short circuit.

Therefore, the red wire did cause the short circuit.

Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key.

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis
Question: Did the red wire cause the short circuit?
Model's Answer: Yes
Correct Answer: No

The causal question involves the understanding that causation is a complex issue involving not just the final state (i.e., a short circuit) but also the sequence and nature of events leading up to that final state. In this case, the model considered the final state and the concurrent touching of the wires. However, it missed the crucial factor that the intervention of either wire alone would not cause a short circuit, and the interaction of both was necessary.

The model failed to consider that while the red wire touched the battery, it was actually the design of the machine that led to the short circuit happening when both red and black wires touched the battery concurrently.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis
Question: Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?
Model's Answer: No
Correct Answer: Yes 

In this case, the model failed to understand the conditions under which the motorboat would startâ€”the motor being locked or the gear being in neutral. While Ned didn't actively do anything to the motor, his inaction (not changing the lock position) contributed to the conditions necessary for beginning the boat.

The prompt might not have underscored the significance of inaction and therefore led the model to incorrectly believe that Ned's non-interference with the motor lock was not a contributing factor to causing the boat to start.

Prompt Improvement:
1) Emphasize Sequencing: The prompt needs to stress the importance of the sequences leading to an outcome, not just the final state.

2) Highlight Inaction: The prompt also needs to highlight that often, inaction can be as significant as action in determining causality.

3) Multiple Causes: The revised prompt should incorporate the possibility of multiple causes or factors contributing to the final result.

4) Interaction of Causes: Finally, the prompt should underscore that causation may be due to the interaction of different causes rather than isolated actions.

Revised Prompt: "Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causes leading to the final outcome. This includes consideration of sequences of events, inaction as well as action, and importantly, the interaction of different factors. Distinguish between accidental and intended outcomes, and consider any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Recognize that multiple factors may contribute to the final outcome rather than a simplistic direct cause-effect relationship. Provide reasons for your conclusions, demonstrating comprehensive understanding of the scenario. Consider direct intentions, unintended consequences, and the accumulative effects of deviant or non-compliant actions on the eventual result. Your primary objective is to determine the most reasonable cause or causes."

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Todd, Anne, Jason, and Steph all share an account for a popular online television streaming service. In addition to keeping the account constantly logged in on their TV, they also use the same account on their laptops. Because the provider of this streaming service wants to increase the amount of active accounts in order to increase profits, they have begun to monitor the number of devices using a single account at once. Given that the account is always logged in on their TV, the streaming service will suspend their account if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time. Todd, Anne, and Jason regularly use their account from their laptops on Saturdays. This Saturday, as usual, Todd logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Sure enough, since three people logged into the streaming account at the same time, the account was suspended. Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop did cause the account to be suspended. The streaming service clearly stated that if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time, the account will be suspended. Todd's action of logging in was intentional, and it directly led to the account being suspended due to the violation of the service's terms. Therefore, the most plausible cause of the account suspension was Todd's intentional action of logging in.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Question: Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended? 

Wrong answer: (A) Yes

Reason: The language model seems to have misconstrued the cause-effect relationship in this scenario. Even though Todd's action of logging in contributed to the account being suspended, his action alone would not have suspended the account. The suspension occurred because three people (Todd, Anne, Jason) logged in at the same time. As such, the model failed to acknowledge the combined effect of all the participants' actions and focused solely on Todd. 

Improvements: The prompt needs to be re-framed so that it encourages the model to consider all the actions that culminated in the final outcome, especially in cases where several actions by different people lead to the outcome. The mention of unauthorized deviations might have misled the model into thinking that any individual's action can be the singular cause, but it should be made clear that the actions of people involved should be viewed as a collective.

General Improvements:

1. Highlight the requirement to consider the collective impact of multiple actions: The prompt should emphasize that the model should always consider all actions and their combined effects, rather than attributing the outcome to a single action.

2. Remove or refine mention of authorized/unauthorized deviations: This can lead to confusion when the scenario involves shared responsibility or collective action.

3. Simplify the prompt: The current prompt is complex and contains too many instructions, which might be confusing the language model. A more straightforward and clear prompting would work better.

4. Provide samples/examples: The instructions could include an example of a proper analysis to help the model understand the expectations better.

5. Address complex interactions: Include a point in the prompt about considering non-linear cause-effect relationships and complex interactions between different actions. 

6. Encourage compound reasoning: This involves considering multiple factors and weighing the probabilities of each before coming to a conclusion. The prompt should encourage the model to explore this aspect further. 

7. Request reasoning behind answers: The model should be prompted to explain its reasoning as to why it has chosen a particular answer. This would allow better insight into the model's thought process and allow for more targeted improvements in the future.

Just then, Anne also logged into their account from her laptop, and Jason also logged into their account from his laptop to watch TV. Sure enough, since three people logged into the streaming account at the same time, the account was suspended. Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop did cause the account to be suspended. The streaming service clearly stated that if three people log into the account from their laptops at the same time, the account will be suspended. Todd's action of logging in was intentional, and it directly led to the account being suspended due to the violation of the service's terms. Therefore, the most plausible cause of the account suspension was Todd's intentional action of logging in.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1: 

Question: Did Todd logging into the streaming account from his laptop cause the account to be suspended? 

Wrong answer: (A) Yes

Reason: The language model seems to have misconstrued the cause-effect relationship in this scenario. Even though Todd's action of logging in contributed to the account being suspended, his action alone would not have suspended the account. The suspension occurred because three people (Todd, Anne, Jason) logged in at the same time. As such, the model failed to acknowledge the combined effect of all the participants' actions and focused solely on Todd. 

Improvements: The prompt needs to be re-framed so that it encourages the model to consider all the actions that culminated in the final outcome, especially in cases where several actions by different people lead to the outcome. The mention of unauthorized deviations might have misled the model into thinking that any individual's action can be the singular cause, but it should be made clear that the actions of people involved should be viewed as a collective.

General Improvements:

1. Highlight the requirement to consider the collective impact of multiple actions: The prompt should emphasize that the model should always consider all actions and their combined effects, rather than attributing the outcome to a single action.

2. Remove or refine mention of authorized/unauthorized deviations: This can lead to confusion when the scenario involves shared responsibility or collective action.

3. Simplify the prompt: The current prompt is complex and contains too many instructions, which might be confusing the language model. A more straightforward and clear prompting would work better.

4. Provide samples/examples: The instructions could include an example of a proper analysis to help the model understand the expectations better.

5. Address complex interactions: Include a point in the prompt about considering non-linear cause-effect relationships and complex interactions between different actions. 

6. Encourage compound reasoning: This involves considering multiple factors and weighing the probabilities of each before coming to a conclusion. The prompt should encourage the model to explore this aspect further. 

7. Request reasoning behind answers: The model should be prompted to explain its reasoning as to why it has chosen a particular answer. This would allow better insight into the model's thought process and allow for more targeted improvements in the future.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causation, considering both direct and indirect influences leading to the stated outcome. In your response, also provide a rationale for your selected answer choice to demonstrate your reasoning process.
(2) Evaluate the provided scenarios and determine the direct causation, focusing primarily on the stated intentions and goals of the individuals. Consider secondary effects or indirect influences as disparate from the main intent unless explicitly stated otherwise. In ascertaining the causation from the scenarios, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions. Provide clear reasoning for your selected response, thoroughly parsing the scenario information and prioritizing direct intentions over unintended consequences. When in doubt, adhere to dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to guide your understanding.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios and ascertain the causation, taking into account the stated intentions and actions of all individuals involved. When identifying causation, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, giving careful consideration to any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Assess both individual and combined effects of actions, recognizing that the final outcome may be the result of complex interactions rather than a direct linear cause-effect relationship. Across this process, ensure to provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scenario information. While basing your knowledge on dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful that actions may have unintended consequences, and unauthorized deviations could substantially impact the outcome. Your objective is to determine the most plausible cause, focusing not only on the direct intentions, but also on any deviant actions and their potential cumulative impact on the final outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Ned has a new motorboat. When Ned turns the key, the motorboat starts if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position. Today, the gear is in neutral, and the motor is in the lock position. Ned checks the motor to see if it is in the lock position. He sees that it is in the lock position, and he does not change its position at all. Because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the motorboat starts when Ned turns the key. Did the motorboat start because Ned did not change the position of the motor?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the primary cause of the motorboat starting when Ned turns the key is not because Ned did not change the position of the motor. The motorboat started because the gear was in neutral, which is one of the conditions for the motorboat to start. Ned's action of not changing the position of the motor did not directly cause the motorboat to start, as the motor was already in the lock position, which is the other condition for the motorboat to start.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No <answer></answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Mr. Wallace is highly influential in the organized crime scene. Although he commands the respect of many, there are also a number of people who stand to benefit from his death. Today, he was having lunch with one of his associates, Mr. Vincent. At one point during their meeting, Mr. Wallace left the table to go to the toilet. While he was gone, Mr. Vincent managed to slip a lethal dose of poison into his martini. The poison is known to take one hour (give or take 10 minutes, depending on the victim's body weight) to kill and would go unnoticed for the first half hour after consumption. When Mr. Wallace returned to the table, he finished his lunch and then drank the rest of his martini. The two men concluded their meeting a few minutes later. Mr. Wallace paid the bill and they both left the restaurant going in different directions. Mr. Wallace had another important business meeting about 15 minutes away in a remote part of the countryside. On an isolated stretch of road, he noticed that he was suddenly being followed by a van that had pulled out from the roadside. The van accelerated and began hitting his car from behind. Mr. Wallace recognized that the driver was Mr. Bruce, an associate of one of Mr. Wallace's rivals. He tried to evade the van but there was no time. The van relentlessly hit his car and pushed it off the side where it fell into a ravine and exploded. The remains of Mr. Wallace's body were discovered later that day. The chief coroner's report later revealed that Mr. Wallace had received fatal burns in the car explosion. The report also indicated, however, that a lethal dose of poison was found in Mr. Wallace's blood. Did the car crash cause Mr. Wallace's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The car crash did not cause Mr. Wallace's death. The primary cause of Mr. Wallace's death was the lethal dose of poison that was slipped into his martini by Mr. Vincent. The poison was known to take about an hour to kill, and Mr. Wallace consumed it during his lunch meeting. The car crash, orchestrated by Mr. Bruce, was a secondary event that occurred after Mr. Wallace had already ingested the poison. The poison had already taken effect by the time the car crash happened, making it the direct cause of Mr. Wallace's death.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Drew, Kylie, Oliver, and Jen are regular customers at a small, local coffee shop. Given the selling price of the coffee and the cost of daily operation, the coffee shop will turn a profit if anyone orders coffee on a given day. Only one person ordering coffee is needed for the coffee shop to turn a profit that day. Drew, Kylie, and Oliver usually order coffee on Tuesdays. This Tuesday, as usual, Drew ordered coffee. The same day, Kylie ordered coffee, and Oliver also ordered coffee. Since at least one person ordered coffee on Tuesday, the coffee shop made a profit that day. Did Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Drew ordering coffee on Tuesday did not directly cause the coffee shop to make a profit that day. The coffee shop would have made a profit as long as at least one person ordered coffee, and in this case, both Kylie and Oliver also ordered coffee. Therefore, the primary cause of the coffee shop making a profit that day was not solely Drew ordering coffee, but the collective actions of Drew, Kylie, and Oliver ordering coffee on that day.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The first wrong example concerns causation in the context of Ned's motorboat. The model incorrectly assumed that because the motorboat would start if either the gear is in neutral or the motor is in the lock position, the primary cause was the gear being in neutral instead of Ned's inaction to change the motor from its lock position. However, the question asks if Ned's non-action was a cause for the motorboat starting. Ned's decision not to change the lock position of the motor, which made one of the start conditions true, was indeed a cause. The model seemed to struggle with the concept that inaction can lead to causation.

<2> 
The second wrong answer relates to Mr. Wallace's death. The model incorrectly rules out the car crash as a cause of death due to the previous ingestion of poison. The crash caused a fatal explosion, which would also lead to death, making it a simultaneous and immediate cause of death. The model seems to struggle with the concept of multiple, concurrent causes leading to the same outcome.

<3> 
In the third example, the model incorrectly assumed that because other people (Kylie and Oliver) also ordered coffee, Drew's coffee order was not a cause for the coffee shop's profit. The question asks specifically about Drew's order causing the shop's profit, and since the shop requires only one coffee order to make a profit, Drew's order was indeed a cause. Therefore, the model seems to struggle with understanding that when any individual's action fulfills a condition for an outcome, it can be considered a cause, despite similar actions from others.

Improvements:
1. The prompt needs to clarify that an outcome can have multiple primary causes, some of which may be inactions rather than actions.
2. It should highlight that when multiple people do similar actions leading to an outcome, each individual's action can be separately considered a cause.
3. The prompt should clarify the complexity of causation. It must guide the model to recognize that some actions and inactions can be potential primary causes even if they are not the only actions that brought about the outcome.
4. The prompt should reinforce understanding that primary cause can still be considered even if concurrent, separate causes integral to the outcome exist.
5. The model should be prompted to consider all aspects of a scenario to reach a balanced conclusion properly, avoiding tunnel-vision on certain aspects only.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causation, considering both direct and indirect influences leading to the stated outcome. In your response, also provide a rationale for your selected answer choice to demonstrate your reasoning process.
(2) Evaluate the provided scenarios and determine the direct causation, focusing primarily on the stated intentions and goals of the individuals. Consider secondary effects or indirect influences as disparate from the main intent unless explicitly stated otherwise. In ascertaining the causation from the scenarios, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions. Provide clear reasoning for your selected response, thoroughly parsing the scenario information and prioritizing direct intentions over unintended consequences. When in doubt, adhere to dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to guide your understanding.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios and ascertain the causation, taking into account the stated intentions and actions of all individuals involved. When identifying causation, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, giving careful consideration to any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Assess both individual and combined effects of actions, recognizing that the final outcome may be the result of complex interactions rather than a direct linear cause-effect relationship. Across this process, ensure to provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scenario information. While basing your knowledge on dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful that actions may have unintended consequences, and unauthorized deviations could substantially impact the outcome. Your objective is to determine the most plausible cause, focusing not only on the direct intentions, but also on any deviant actions and their potential cumulative impact on the final outcome.
(4) Analyze the given scenarios, pinpoint the causation considering all intentional and unintentional actions taken by each individual involved. Contextualize each action within its wider effect on the situation, considering both the singular and cumulative impacts. Be aware of the possibility that the outcome may not be the direct result of one action but a complex intertwining of multiple actions, decisions, and events. When harbouring doubts about 'intentional' or 'unintentional', resort to standard dictionary definitions. Nevertheless, remember that actions may create unforeseen results and that both authorized and unauthorized deviations from stated guidelines can considerably influence the conclusion. Your goal is to identify the most credible primary cause with a holistic consideration of all actions involved, their intentional or unintentional nature, and their individual and collective effects on the outcome. In your response, explain your reasoning and justification for arriving at a particular cause attributing the outcome.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:

<START> Delve into the provided scenarios, identifying causation considering all actions, both intentional and unintentional, of each individual involved. Frame each action within its broader implications on the situation, evaluating both the individual and cumulative effects. Acknowledge the possibility that the outcome may not solely be the product of one action, but potentially a complex mix of multiple actions, decisions, and events. When gauging 'intentional' or 'unintentional', resort to standard dictionary definitions, however, keep in mind that actions can have unforeseen consequences and both authorized and unauthorized deviations from stated guidelines could significantly influence the outcome. Emphasize that inaction may also be a cause. An outcome could have multiple individual causes occurring concurrently. Even when the outcome can be achieved by various actions, any action leading to that outcome can be considered a cause. Your objective is to deduce the most plausible primary cause(s) with a comprehensive examination of all actions involved, their intentional or unintentional nature, and their individual and collective effects on the outcome. Articulate your reasoning and justification for selecting a particular cause or causes attributing to the outcome in your response. Consider the complexity of causal relationships and avoid restricting your evaluation to apparent actions or a single linear cause-effect relationship. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
John's premature death was primarily caused by his job in the plastics division. The decision to switch divisions exposed him to asbestos, which ultimately led to his lung cancer. While the accidental administration of the wrong medication by the new nurse did contribute to his death, the root cause can be traced back to his prolonged exposure to asbestos in the workplace.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given scenarios, pinpoint the causation considering all intentional and unintentional actions taken by each individual involved. Contextualize each action within its wider effect on the situation, considering both the singular and cumulative impacts. Be aware of the possibility that the outcome may not be the direct result of one action but a complex intertwining of multiple actions, decisions, and events.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that two people are available to answer phone calls during designated calling hours, the company issued the following official policy: Billy and Suzy are both permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, and neither of them are permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the primary cause of the deletion of work emails containing important customer information was the simultaneous logging in of both Billy and Suzy into the central computer. The company's policy of allowing both of them to log in at the same time in the mornings inadvertently led to the deletion of the emails. Suzy did not intentionally cause the deletion of the emails; it was a result of the unintended consequence of both individuals being logged in simultaneously.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If two people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol also turns on her lamp. Since two people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the primary cause of the circuit breaker failing was the simultaneous action of Jim and Carol turning on their lamps at the same time. The restriction on the number of people using power at the same time was clearly stated, and the consequence of two people turning on their lamps simultaneously was explicitly mentioned as causing the breaker to fail. Jim's intentional action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM on a day he was not supposed to use it did contribute to the outcome, but the direct cause was the combined action of both Jim and Carol turning on their lamps at the same time.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this case, the prompt's emphasis on identifying the "most credible primary cause" of the situation may have influenced the model to pick the lung cancer, which it attributed to John's job at the plastics division, as the factor that led to John's premature death. However, the question explicitly asked whether his job 'caused' his death, putting the immediate cause (i.e., incorrect medication) into question. While his job might have led to a health condition that would have caused his death eventually, the immediate cause of his death was in fact the incorrect administration of medication.

<2> The prompt makes a point to consider "unintentional" actions and their larger effect on the situation. However, in this case, the model seems to have focused too heavily on the unintentional consequences of the company policy and the collective result of interacting with the central computer, rather than seeing Suzy's action of logging into the computer as a direct cause for the deletion of emails. While it was unintentional from Suzy's end, the causality of her action is clearer when observing the situation as a part of a sequence of events where Suzy's action is a necessary condition.

<3> The nuanced definition of 'cause' in this prompt may have led the model to conclude that Jim was not the only one responsible for the breaker's failure. The model might have over-emphasized the idea of 'singular and cumulative impacts,' thereby attributing the failure to the simultaneous operation of lamps by Jim and Carol. However, the fact remains that Jim was the only one who was not authorized to use the lamp at that time, making his action a direct contravention of policy and thus a direct cause of the failure.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Provide clear definitions of 'cause': The model seems to have a wider interpretation of 'cause', which might be more suited for cases that require analysis of a chain of events. Provide a more specific definition of 'cause', focusing on the element that unlawfully or unexpectedly changes the expected sequence of events.
   
2. Emphasize immediate versus underlying causes: While considering the wider context of each situation, it is also essential to distinguish between immediate and underlying causes. A clear demarcation could help the model make more accurate assessments.
   
3. Stress on the adherence to rules or policies: The model needs to give substantial weight to the actions that deviate from stated guidelines and understanding of those deviations as direct causes for outcomes.

4. Make clear that even unintentional actions can have causal power: While the prompt does talk about 'unintentional' actions, it seems the model still struggles with this concept in practice. The model should consider the direct, immediate results of actions, whether or not those outcomes were intended by the parties involved.

5. The prompt should insist the model to focus on the specific circumstances and individual timelines of each case: The current prompt has a â€˜one-size-fits-allâ€™ approach, which might lead to inaccuracies in more complex cases. The improved prompt should have the flexibility to differentiate between scenarios based on their complexity.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is set on HIGH. He does not change the setting at all, and he leaves the temperature set to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David did not change the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the primary cause of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes is not because David did not change the temperature setting. The main reason for the clothes drying in sixty minutes is that the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, which is sufficient to dry the clothes within that time frame. The temperature setting being on HIGH is an additional factor that contributes to the drying process but is not the sole reason for the clothes drying in sixty minutes. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Louie did not win the $100 bet solely because he made the layup. The primary cause of Louie winning the bet was making the 3-point shot at the buzzer. While making the layup contributed to his overall score, it was the 3-point shot that ultimately secured his victory in the bet. Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The model seems to be focusing excessively on identifying a 'primary cause', as highlighted in the prompt. In doing so, it neglects the provided conditions where either the 'MAX DRY' setting or 'HIGH' temperature would independently cause the clothes to dry in 60 minutes.

Prompt Improvement:
In this scenario, the prompt should emphasize the importance of considering all possible causes to an outcome and avoiding premature determination of a predominant cause. It should specify that if an action, regardless of its magnitude, directly contributes to an outcome, it should be viewed as a causative factor.

Example 2: 

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The model similarly errs in this scenario by seeking a single cause while ignoring that both the layup and the 3-point shot independently would have led to Louie winning the $100. The prompt's insistence on a primary cause might mislead the model to overlook multiple causative factors.

Prompt Improvement:
Similar to the first example, the prompt should clarify that multiple causes can independently lead to the outcome. The concept of 'either-or' condition should be well interpreted. Occasionally, the 'most credible' cause could be more than one cause happening at different times or different contexts.

Based on the reasons mentioned above, several aspects can improve the prompt:
1. Reemphasize that outcomes can be the result of one or more independent actions.
2. The 'most credible primary cause' may be multiple causes in certain situations.
3. The prompt should restress the need to consider all actions that directly contribute to the outcome, regardless of their perceived significance. It should not prioritize the search for a single primary cause. 
4. Incorporate clear instructions for evaluating 'either-or' conditions and their contributions to the final outcome. Cause can be attributed to individual independent conditions under these circumstances.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causation, considering both direct and indirect influences leading to the stated outcome. In your response, also provide a rationale for your selected answer choice to demonstrate your reasoning process.
(2) Evaluate the provided scenarios and determine the direct causation, focusing primarily on the stated intentions and goals of the individuals. Consider secondary effects or indirect influences as disparate from the main intent unless explicitly stated otherwise. In ascertaining the causation from the scenarios, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions. Provide clear reasoning for your selected response, thoroughly parsing the scenario information and prioritizing direct intentions over unintended consequences. When in doubt, adhere to dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to guide your understanding.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios and ascertain the causation, taking into account the stated intentions and actions of all individuals involved. When identifying causation, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, giving careful consideration to any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Assess both individual and combined effects of actions, recognizing that the final outcome may be the result of complex interactions rather than a direct linear cause-effect relationship. Across this process, ensure to provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scenario information. While basing your knowledge on dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful that actions may have unintended consequences, and unauthorized deviations could substantially impact the outcome. Your objective is to determine the most plausible cause, focusing not only on the direct intentions, but also on any deviant actions and their potential cumulative impact on the final outcome.
(4) Analyze the given scenarios, pinpoint the causation considering all intentional and unintentional actions taken by each individual involved. Contextualize each action within its wider effect on the situation, considering both the singular and cumulative impacts.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. The students cheated on the test. One student, John Granger, did not go along with the group. Granger deviates from the local norm and refuses to cheat on the test. The biology class comprises 80 students and is graded on a curve such that 20 people will receive a grade of A, 20 a grade of B, 20 a grade of C, and 20 students will receive a D. A group of students who lived on the same floor of a dormitory obtained a copy of the final exam for their biology class. Granger's score was the 20th-highest score in the class, which means he was the last student to receive a grade of A. The 21st student was a pre-med student who received a B and, as a result, missed the GPA cutoff she needed to get into the medical school she was hoping for by .07 GPA points. Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Granger's decision not to cheat on the final exam directly impacted the grading curve, resulting in the pre-med student missing the GPA cutoff for medical school. Granger's deviation from the norm by refusing to cheat ultimately led to the pre-med student receiving a lower grade than she needed. Therefore, Granger can be considered the cause of the student failing to meet the medical school cutoff.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Eugene and Tina were a young married couple who lived in the country. Both were partially paralyzed and confined to wheelchairs. They had met four years before when Tina was a counsellor with the Canadian Paraplegic Association, had fallen in love, and were married one year later. On this particular evening, Eugene had phoned to request a cab to take them downtown. When the taxi driver arrived, Eugene and Tina were waiting by the street. On seeing that they were both in wheelchairs, the taxi driver refused their fare because he thought it would be too crowded in the taxi with both of them and the wheelchairs. So the taxi driver headed back downtown without them. Because there was no time to call another cab, Eugene and Tina took Tina's car, which was equipped with special hand controls. In order to get downtown from their house, they had to travel across a bridge over Rupert River. A severe storm the night before had weakened the structure of the bridge. About 5 minutes before Eugene and Tina reached it, a section of the bridge collapsed. The taxi driver had reached the bridge about 15 minutes before them, and made it safely across. In the dark, Eugene and Tina drove off the collapsed bridge and their car plummeted into the river below. They both drowned. Their bodies were retrieved from the car the next morning. Did the taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina cause their death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina did not directly cause their death. While his decision may have contributed to the chain of events that led to the tragic outcome, it was not the sole cause. The collapse of the bridge due to the storm weakened structure was the primary cause of their death. Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Question: Did Granger cause the student to fail to meet the medical school cutoff?
Model's response: (A) Yes
Correct answer: (B) No

The model incorrectly inferred that Granger's actions led to the pre-med student failing to meet the medical school cutoff. It attributes the failure to meet the cutoff to Granger's decision not to cheat, instead of recognizing the cheating action of the other students as the primary culprit. The prompt may have led to the wrong answer due to its emphasis on assessing deliberate actions and inactions and their impact on the end results. This might have led the model to disproportionately attribute the end result to Granger's action. 

Example 2:

Question: Did the taxi driver's refusal to take Eugene and Tina cause their death?
Model's response: (B) No
Correct answer: (A) Yes

The model incorrectly answered that the taxi driver's refusal did not cause Eugene and Tina's death. It identified the bridge collapse as the primary cause, failing to recognize the role of the taxi driver in the series of events leading to their death. The prompt's influence in this incorrect answer might be due to its emphasis on identifying the 'most probable cause' which could have led the model to select the immediate cause (the bridge collapse) rather than considering the full sequence of events (including the taxi driver's refusal) that led to the outcome.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. The prompt can emphasize both immediate and antecedent causes in a series of events leading to an end result. This can help the model identify not just the apparent cause but the complex chain of events behind an outcome.

2. The prompt should encourage the model to assess ethically complex situations more accurately, by considering the broader context, not just the specific actions or inactions of individuals. 

3. The prompt can stress the importance of considering normative behaviors versus deviations when assessing causations in scenarios.

4. Lastly, the prompt can better highlight the importance of relative weightage of factors when determining causality, ensuring that the model does not disproportionately attribute the outcome to a less influential factor.

(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causation, considering both direct and indirect influences leading to the stated outcome. In your response, also provide a rationale for your selected answer choice to demonstrate your reasoning process.
(2) Evaluate the provided scenarios and determine the direct causation, focusing primarily on the stated intentions and goals of the individuals. Consider secondary effects or indirect influences as disparate from the main intent unless explicitly stated otherwise. In ascertaining the causation from the scenarios, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions. Provide clear reasoning for your selected response, thoroughly parsing the scenario information and prioritizing direct intentions over unintended consequences. When in doubt, adhere to dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to guide your understanding.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios and ascertain the causation, taking into account the stated intentions and actions of all individuals involved. When identifying causation, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, giving careful consideration to any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Assess both individual and combined effects of actions, recognizing that the final outcome may be the result of complex interactions rather than a direct linear cause-effect relationship. Across this process, ensure to provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scenario information. While basing your knowledge on dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful that actions may have unintended consequences, and unauthorized deviations could substantially impact the outcome. Your objective is to determine the most plausible cause, focusing not only on the direct intentions, but also on any deviant actions and their potential cumulative impact on the final outcome.
(4) Assess the given scenarios, identifying causes and effects while taking into account the deliberate actions and inactions of the individuals involved. Distinguish between accidental outcomes and intentional results, taking care to consider any deviations from instructions or guidelines. Weigh the singular and combined impacts of actions, understanding that the final outcome may not merely be the result of a single, linear cause-effect relationship. Throughout this process, articulate clear reasoning for your chosen response, demonstrating a comprehensive interpretation of the scenario details. As you evaluate the situations, refer to the conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional'. Remember that certain actions may inadvertently lead to consequences that were not the main aim, and that unauthorized departures from expected actions can greatly alter the end result.

A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem arose from the fact that both the hedgehog and the bear were taking pencils out of the box, leading to a depletion of the pencils. The hedgehog's actions were unintentional, as it was not aware of the new rule regarding pencil use. The bear, on the other hand, intentionally took pencils out of the box despite knowing the rule. The cumulative impact of both animals taking pencils ultimately led to the depletion of pencils, causing the polar bear to be unable to finish his homework.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish did not directly cause Karen's death. While it is true that Karen had a rare hereditary disease that made her allergic to fermented drinks, Mr. Carlson was not aware of this condition. He made a decision based on his own preferences and the menu options available, without any intention to harm Karen. Additionally, Mr. Carlson initially considered ordering a dish without wine, indicating that he was not intentionally trying to expose Karen to a harmful substance. The ultimate cause of Karen's death was her hereditary disease, which led to a severe allergic reaction to the wine sauce in the Moules Mariniere. Therefore, the answer is: (B) No <answer>(B)</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>

Analysis: The model interprets the term cause here incorrectly. It assesses the scenario fundamentally from a perspective of intentionality and the awareness of rules, not taking into account that the prompt asks for the most PROBABLE cause. In the given scenario, regardless of why (intentional or not), the hedgehog did contribute to the pencils running out because it took some - unintentionally contributing to the problem.

Reasons: This misinterpretation could be a result of the prompt focusing too much on the difference between deliberate actions and unintentional consequences. The model seems to be developing a bias towards intentional actions having more likelihood of causing an effect.

Improvements: As a result of this, the prompt should emphasize the importance of both unintentional and intentional outcomes equally. Directly instruct the AI that lack of intention to do harm or cause a result doesn't necessarily remove the responsibility of the causation. 

<2>
Analysis: Similar to the first one. The model seems to be focussed on intention, awareness and knowledge. Mr. Carlson, while unintentional and unaware, by choosing a dish with wine sauce did cause, even if accidentally, the allergic reaction that led to Karen's death.

Reasons: The prompt seems to encourage the model to look at unintentional actions as having less cause-effect relationship, rather than seeing actions and consequences independently of intentionality.

Improvements: The revised prompt should emphasize that even if there is no knowledge or intent, the consequential actions still may have caused the outcome.

General Improvements:
1. Clarify and stress that the intentionality of an action doesn't preclude it from being a likely cause of a result or problem.
2. Make the prompt more explicit in instructing the model that both intentional and unintentional actions could have caused the resultant effect.
3. Add instructions to validate and balance between the potential of unintentional and intentional actions equally when determining the cause. 
4. Establish that even actions taken unknowingly or without the full understanding of the potential impacts, can be causes of particular effects.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A bear and a hedgehog were shown a box full of colored pencils. Only bears were allowed to take pencils, whereas hedgehogs were not allowed to take them. The hedgehog was absent when the new rule about pencil use was announced. Therefore, the hedgehog did not know about the new norm. Both animals alternately took pencils out of the box six times. At last, the hedgehog and the bear came to the box and simultaneously took a pencil. A short time later, another animal, a polar bear, approached the box seeking a pencil to do his homework with. However, there were no pencils left in the box. The polar bear could not finish his homework. Did the hedgehog cause the problem?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the hedgehog did not cause the problem. The problem arose from the fact that both the hedgehog and the bear were taking pencils out of the box, leading to a depletion of the pencils. The hedgehog's actions were unintentional, as it was not aware of the new rule regarding pencil use. The bear, on the other hand, intentionally took pencils out of the box despite knowing the rule. The cumulative impact of both animals taking pencils ultimately led to the depletion of pencils, causing the polar bear to be unable to finish his homework.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Karen was an assistant editor for a small publishing firm. She had a rare hereditary disease called Karpinson's hemotrysoma, characterized by the lack of an enzyme that normally breaks down certain proteins in the digestive system. Because of this, fermented drinks such as wine and liqueurs can cause a severe allergic reaction in someone with the disease. Karen had just received a promotion so her boss, Mr. Carlson, took her to an expensive French restaurant to celebrate. Mr. Carlson had been to this restaurant several times, so he ordered for both of them. As he looked over the menu, Mr. Carlson considered what to order for Karen. He first thought about ordering the Scallops Meuniere, but at the last moment decided on the Moules Mariniere instead. Although Mr. Carlson did not know this, the Moules Mariniere was made in a wine sauce whereas the Scallops Meuniere did not contain any wine. Karen enjoyed her meal greatly, but began to feel ill shortly after finishing. Within minutes, she went into convulsions and was rushed away in an ambulance. She died on the way to the hospital. Did Mr. Carlson's choice of dish cause Karen's death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Mr. Carlson's choice of dish did not directly cause Karen's death. While it is true that Karen had a rare hereditary disease that made her allergic to fermented drinks, Mr. Carlson was not aware of this condition. He made a decision based on his own preferences and the menu options available, without any intention to harm Karen. Additionally, Mr. Carlson initially considered ordering a dish without wine, indicating that he was not intentionally trying to expose Karen to a harmful substance. The ultimate cause of Karen's death was her hereditary disease, which led to a severe allergic reaction to the wine sauce in the Moules Mariniere. Therefore, the answer is: (B) No <answer>(B)</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>

Analysis: The model interprets the term cause here incorrectly. It assesses the scenario fundamentally from a perspective of intentionality and the awareness of rules, not taking into account that the prompt asks for the most PROBABLE cause. In the given scenario, regardless of why (intentional or not), the hedgehog did contribute to the pencils running out because it took some - unintentionally contributing to the problem.

Reasons: This misinterpretation could be a result of the prompt focusing too much on the difference between deliberate actions and unintentional consequences. The model seems to be developing a bias towards intentional actions having more likelihood of causing an effect.

Improvements: As a result of this, the prompt should emphasize the importance of both unintentional and intentional outcomes equally. Directly instruct the AI that lack of intention to do harm or cause a result doesn't necessarily remove the responsibility of the causation. 

<2>
Analysis: Similar to the first one. The model seems to be focussed on intention, awareness and knowledge. Mr. Carlson, while unintentional and unaware, by choosing a dish with wine sauce did cause, even if accidentally, the allergic reaction that led to Karen's death.

Reasons: The prompt seems to encourage the model to look at unintentional actions as having less cause-effect relationship, rather than seeing actions and consequences independently of intentionality.

Improvements: The revised prompt should emphasize that even if there is no knowledge or intent, the consequential actions still may have caused the outcome.

General Improvements:
1. Clarify and stress that the intentionality of an action doesn't preclude it from being a likely cause of a result or problem.
2. Make the prompt more explicit in instructing the model that both intentional and unintentional actions could have caused the resultant effect.
3. Add instructions to validate and balance between the potential of unintentional and intentional actions equally when determining the cause. 
4. Establish that even actions taken unknowingly or without the full understanding of the potential impacts, can be causes of particular effects.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causation, considering both direct and indirect influences leading to the stated outcome. In your response, also provide a rationale for your selected answer choice to demonstrate your reasoning process.
(2) Evaluate the provided scenarios and determine the direct causation, focusing primarily on the stated intentions and goals of the individuals. Consider secondary effects or indirect influences as disparate from the main intent unless explicitly stated otherwise. In ascertaining the causation from the scenarios, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions. Provide clear reasoning for your selected response, thoroughly parsing the scenario information and prioritizing direct intentions over unintended consequences. When in doubt, adhere to dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to guide your understanding.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios and ascertain the causation, taking into account the stated intentions and actions of all individuals involved. When identifying causation, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, giving careful consideration to any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Assess both individual and combined effects of actions, recognizing that the final outcome may be the result of complex interactions rather than a direct linear cause-effect relationship. Across this process, ensure to provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scenario information. While basing your knowledge on dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful that actions may have unintended consequences, and unauthorized deviations could substantially impact the outcome. Your objective is to determine the most plausible cause, focusing not only on the direct intentions, but also on any deviant actions and their potential cumulative impact on the final outcome.
(4) Assess the given scenarios, identifying causes and effects while taking into account the deliberate actions and inactions of the individuals involved. Distinguish between accidental outcomes and intentional results, taking care to consider any deviations from instructions or guidelines. Weigh the singular and combined impacts of actions, understanding that the final outcome may not merely be the result of a single, linear cause-effect relationship. Throughout this process, articulate clear reasoning for your chosen response, demonstrating a comprehensive interpretation of the scenario details. As you evaluate the situations, refer to the conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional'. Remember that certain actions may inadvertently lead to consequences that were not the main aim, and that unauthorized departures from expected actions can greatly alter the end result. Your task is to isolate the most probable cause, taking into account not just the explicit intentions, but also the possible cumulative impact of indirect actions, including administrative or procedural decisions and their potential influence on the final outcome. Understand that the cause does not always have to be a direct, tangible action and that seemingly distant factors can play an equally significant role in determining the outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two-sided dice and flip a coin. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of his dice roll is greater than 2 AND the coin comes up heads. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2, and the coin has equal odds of coming up heads or tails. Alex flips the coin and rolls his dice at exactly the same time. The coin comes up heads, and he rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2. Alex wins the game. Did Alex win because of the coin flip?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's win was not solely due to the coin flip. The conditions for his win were that he needed to roll greater than 2 on the dice AND have the coin come up heads. While the coin flip did contribute to his win by coming up heads, the main factor was his dice roll of 12, which met the requirement of being greater than 2. Therefore, the coin flip was not the sole cause of Alex's win.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first example, the question asks if the hedgehog caused the problem of the polar bear not being able to finish his homework due to a lack of pencils. The AI model wrongly assigns the cause of the problem, stating that it's due to both the hedgehog and the bear taking pencils, even though the scenario explicitly mentioned that only the bear was allowed to take pencils. 

The original prompt puts a significant emphasis on interpreting the details of scenarios and considering whether actions followed the provided instructions or guidelines. In this case, the model fails to interpret the fact that the hedgehog was contravening rules by taking pencils. Its decision making seems to have been biased towards a collective causality, disregarding the deliberate disobedience of the hedgehog.

It's likely that this incorrect answer came from an overemphasis on shared responsibility, and not enough emphasis on strictly obeying guidelines and instructions. The instruction about considering deviations from the norms wasn't followed adequately, leading to a wrong answer.

Wrong Example 2:

The second example questions whether Alex's winning of the game was a result of the coin flip. The AI model stated the win was not solely due to the coin flip but rather because of the combination of the dice roll and coin flip. 

The model seems to have been misguided by the phrase in the prompt, "isolate the most probable cause", leading it to quantify the level of influence exerted by individual factors which resulted in it deeming the dice roll more significant. This logic is flawed as the question doesn't seek for the most significant factor, but rather if the coin flip was a causal factor. If the model had accurately assessed the conditionality of the win, it would have concluded that the coin flip was indeeed a cause, as without it, Alex wouldn't have won.

Potentials for Improvement:

1. The prompt could stress the importance of closely following rules and conditions set in the scenarios for assigning cause and effect. Instructions could be enhanced by stressing the need to follow rules outlined in the given scenario
2. Improve the phrasing regarding assigning causes. Instead of "isolate the most probable cause", the model should be trained to "identify all plausible causes". 
3. The prompt should better differentiate between significant and necessary causes. That way conflicts, like in example 2, would be less likely to occur. 
3. The prompt should encourage the examination of both direct and indirect causes, so that unconventional causation routes, like the indirect disobedience in example 1, are not overlooked. 
4. The model should be trained more to evaluate the influence of each individual action in scenarios and also how certain actions could create or induce structural shifts in prevailing norms or rules of the scenario.
5. The prompt can be improved by stressing the importance of following language semantics, for instance differentiating between plurality implied by the use of "and" conjunction versus singularity.

3. The prompt should encourage the examination of both direct and indirect causes, so that unconventional causation routes, like the indirect disobedience in example 1, are not overlooked. 
4. The model should be trained more to evaluate the influence of each individual action in scenarios and also how certain actions could create or induce structural shifts in prevailing norms or rules of the scenario.
5. The prompt can be improved by stressing the importance of following language semantics, for instance differentiating between plurality implied by the use of "and" conjunction versus singularity.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and determine the causation, considering both direct and indirect influences leading to the stated outcome. In your response, also provide a rationale for your selected answer choice to demonstrate your reasoning process.
(2) Evaluate the provided scenarios and determine the direct causation, focusing primarily on the stated intentions and goals of the individuals. Consider secondary effects or indirect influences as disparate from the main intent unless explicitly stated otherwise. In ascertaining the causation from the scenarios, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions. Provide clear reasoning for your selected response, thoroughly parsing the scenario information and prioritizing direct intentions over unintended consequences. When in doubt, adhere to dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to guide your understanding.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios and ascertain the causation, taking into account the stated intentions and actions of all individuals involved. When identifying causation, differentiate between accidental outcomes and intentional actions, giving careful consideration to any deviations from guidelines or instructions. Assess both individual and combined effects of actions, recognizing that the final outcome may be the result of complex interactions rather than a direct linear cause-effect relationship. Across this process, ensure to provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a thorough understanding of the scenario information. While basing your knowledge on dictionary definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful that actions may have unintended consequences, and unauthorized deviations could substantially impact the outcome. Your objective is to determine the most plausible cause, focusing not only on the direct intentions, but also on any deviant actions and their potential cumulative impact on the final outcome.
(4) Assess the given scenarios, identifying causes and effects while taking into account the deliberate actions and inactions of the individuals involved. Distinguish between accidental outcomes and intentional results, taking care to consider any deviations from instructions or guidelines. Weigh the singular and combined impacts of actions, understanding that the final outcome may not merely be the result of a single, linear cause-effect relationship. Throughout this process, articulate clear reasoning for your chosen response, demonstrating a comprehensive interpretation of the scenario details. As you evaluate the situations, refer to the conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional'. Remember that certain actions may inadvertently lead to consequences that were not the main aim, and that unauthorized departures from expected actions can greatly alter the end result. Your task is to isolate the most probable cause, taking into account not just the explicit intentions, but also the possible cumulative impact of indirect actions, including administrative or procedural decisions and their potential influence on the final outcome. Understand that the cause does not always have to be a direct, tangible action and that seemingly distant factors can play an equally significant role in determining the outcome.

<START> Analyze the provided scenarios, identifying causes and effects while taking into account both the deliberate actions and unintentional inactions of every individual. Observe their compliance or deviation from the set guidelines or instructions. Consciously distinguish between accidental outcomes and deliberate results, shedding light on those actions that may indirectly lead to unintended consequences or significantly alter the final outcome. Concurrently, weigh the individual and combined impacts of actions, being aware that the final outcome might not always be the result of a single chain of cause and effect. As you articulate your response, ensure your reasoning clearly demarcates between necessary and merely influential causes. Steer away from isolating the most probable cause, instead identify all plausible causes taking into account not just the explicit intentions but also the possible cumulative impact of every indirect action. Remember, the cause may not always be a distinctly apparent action but could be influenced by decisions made at different levels. Use conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to inform your judgement. This task requires you to examine the effect of each individual action regardless of its size, how certain disregard of norms or rules might indirectly alter the end result and how sequence of actions can help establish causation. At the end of your analysis, show the chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.<END>

   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects.

   reward: 0.5800 | Q: 1.2200 | uct: 3.3014 | cum_rewards: [1.22]
   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to grasp the complexity and multi-angular nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events thoroughly, taking into account multiple factors. Do not attribute disproportionate weight to the final or latest events; instead, recognize that each event and action involved may influence the outcome. The decoding of conditional statements is vital to properly discern the cause, considering that cause does not always correspond to intentional action. In your analysis, prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions but also acknowledge that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of those intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is deemed intentional only if it aligns with the actor's primary goals.

Understand the role of unintended consequences that arise when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay close attention to dependencies and the potential impact of different scenarios. If an event would have occurred regardless of a certain action due to an existing condition, consider this information when assigning responsibility. The goal is to maintain a balanced view, focusing equally on all actors involved. Avoid oversimplification or overcomplication, matching the level of your analysis to the complexity of the situation.

Your approach should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality, with focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative scenarios, and unforeseeable effects. When multiple conditions need alignment for an event to occur, no single condition should be labelled as the sole cause.

In summary, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions maintaining the balance between the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Place your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

   reward: 0.6400 | Q: 0.6400 | uct: 2.7214 | cum_rewards: [0.64]
   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, appreciate the intricacy and multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events critically, taking into account multiple factors. Do not concentrate extensively on the final or most recent event; instead, recognize that each event, action, or presence involved may independently or conjointly influence the outcome. Break down conditional statements to understand the cause, being aware that the cause does not always equate to an intentional action.

Prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions in your analysis, but also understand that outcomes may emerge unrelated to those intentions. Note that an outcome is identified as intentional only when it matches the actor's primary objectives. Similarly, cases where the outcome occurs regardless of the original intention due to the presence of alternative conditions need to be identified accurately.

Comprehend the implications of unintended outcomes that arise when the snags of a situation are not fully grasped by the actor. Scrutinize dependencies and the potential ramifications of different possible scenarios, especially when various conditions need synchronization for an event to happen, and refrain from tagging any single variable as the only cause.

Your approach should encompass a nuanced understanding of causality, with a focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unpredicted impacts. When different contributors can independently trigger the event, each should be evaluated as a separate potential cause. Maintain a balanced perspective, focusing equally on all actors or factors involved.

Stay clear of simplifying or complicating the analysis disproportionately to the complexity of the situation. Rather, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions, bearing in mind the necessary equilibrium between the detail of your analysis and the complication of the scenario. Improve accuracy by honing in on the timing of variables and avoid assumptions that may inaccurately combine independent causes. 

Finally, ensure to frame your finalized answer between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

   prompt: When analyzing questions about causal attribution, prioritize a thorough understanding of the complexity and multifaceted aspects of causality. Ensure you assess each chain of events and actions meticulously, taking care to consider multiple elements that might have influenced the outcome. Don't limit your focus to the final or most recent events; give equal attention to prior events as each has the potential to influence the final result. It's essential to interpret conditional statements correctly, and don't assume that a cause is always the result of an intentional act. Make efforts to derive the intentions and motivations that propelled the actions. It's also important to acknowledge situations where, regardless of intent, a certain action played a significant role in shaping the end result. Remember, unintentional consequences can stem from an individual being unaware or misunderstanding a situation. In these cases, their direct or indirect actions could still have had a major impact on the outcome. Scrutinize the dependencies underlying the events, assess if alternative possibilities could've changed the outcome, and consider the consequence of a specific action not being undertaken. If a certain result would have occurred regardless of a specific action due to another condition being fulfilled, ensure you factor this information accurately into your assessment of causality. Your analysis should reflect a nuanced approach to understanding intentionality, simultaneously factoring in actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional outcomes. Don't be swayed by moral judgments when assigning cause â€“ the task is to objectively determine the factors leading to an outcome. Additionally, be mindful of inaction also being a potential causative factor. While analyzing conditional or compound conditional statements, pay close attention to the conditions that must be met for a particular outcome. Ensure your approach is comprehensive and goes beyond surface value, exploring potential alternative interpretations of the same set of events. Include all relevant events and actions, irrespective of their order in the chain, considering their possible causal implications. Your response should be encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event. Thus, careful analysis of conditional statements is integral to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. Remember, a cause is not always the result of an intentional action.

Lastly, express your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>, carefully representing your causal attribution analysis in a clear, condensed form. Be open to complex causal relationships and make full use of common sense reasoning in your deliberations.

   prompt: When determining causal attribution, bear in mind that an event usually has multiple catalyzing factors, that can directly or indirectly contribute. Scrutinize every action, event sequence and contextual factor, considering the interdependencies that exist amongst them. Ignore not even the trivial or coincidental factors, as they can sometimes initiate complex webs of causality. Within your analysis, prioritize understanding conditional statements and delve into the motivations and intentions behind each action, but remember that an action's outcome may still qualify as a cause even if it was unintentional or a side effect of achieving a different objective. 

Acknowledge the multitudinous implications of these motivations and intentions and don't solely attribute the outcome to the final or most recent event. Instead, view it in the wider context of all preceding and collateral events. Make a deliberate effort to identify instances of joint causality, where numerous events or individuals cumulatively contribute towards an outcome.

Differentiate accurately between unintentional outcomes and planned actions. Recollect that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not initially intended. Avoid any inadvertent misinterpretation of conditions when assigning causes, always remembering that a cause might be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Show particular care when dealing with simultaneous events, knowing that they may carry equal significance in triggering an outcome.

As you navigate through the process, be aware that causes often exist on a spectrum and exhibit varying degrees of contribution to an event. Hence, thorough analysis of conditional statements becomes imperative to distinguish between actions that condition an event, actions that provoke an event and actions that simply set the stage. Remember, a cause is not always attributable to an intentional action and can at times be an unintended yet inevitable result.

Finally, express your selection of the answer, irrespective of whether it's subtle or straightforward, by positioning it securely amongst <answer> and </answer> tags. This will represent your causal attribution analysis in a clear and concise format. Appreciate the complexity of causal relationships in your analysis and apply common sense reasoning to your deliberations for robust and comprehensive deductions.

   prompt: When answering questions about causation, it is vital to follow a detailed understanding of the sequence of events, considering all possible factors that might influence the final outcome. Pay attention to conditional statements to discern how interactions between cause and effect are indicated. Always consider that an outcome could be the result of multiple conditions or events that are interconnected. It is crucial to understand that an event's cause isn't always the most recent eventâ€”every event leading up to the final outcome potentially plays a role in the causal chain. Avoid attributing primary causation to a single event if multiple conditions must independently occur for an outcome, and do not underestimate the role of a certain event or condition just because it might not have independently produced the outcome. Simultaneously, analyze the role of sufficiency conditions alongside necessary conditions and examine contexts where a cause may contribute to an outcome without being the sole determinant. Assess each situation within its specific context, bearing in mind the principles guiding the scenario, and resist overgeneralizing cause-effect relationships. Remember, responsibility for causation might not align directly with the cause; hence, consider the significance and role of the asked subject in the presented scenario. With this comprehensive analysis, develop your answer considering every chaining event and causal relationship, but focus on the direct cause asked in the question.

Embedded each action in its broader impact on the scenario while keeping an eye on the isolated as well as the cumulative repercussions. Understand that outcomes might not necessarily be the direct yield of one action, but rather a labyrinth of intertwined actions, choices, and occurrences. When interpreting 'intentional' and 'unintentional', apply standard dictionary definitions. However, remember that actions may yield unexpected results and deviations from given guidelines, whether authorized or unauthorized, can dramatically alter the outcome. For either-or conditions, remember that individual independent conditions can each be the cause. Don't solely hunt for a single 'primary cause', but also inspect each action's contribution to the outcome irrespective of the magnitude of the impact. The aim is to recognize the most plausible causes that lead to the outcome while considering multiple causative factors. Deliver your reasoning and rationale for deriving at a certain cause (or causes) resulting in the outcome.

   prompt: When attempting to answer questions about causal attribution, bear the following principles in mind. Be diligent in considering a comprehensive list of factors that might contribute to an event. This includes not only the final or last observable action, but also previously established conditions and preliminary events. If conditional statements are presented, understand their logical structure and all their implications. Be aware that these conditionals often operate as a chain of dependent events where some conditions might already be satisfied before an additional action takes place. Evaluate every event chronologically and cumulatively before settling on the cause, because an effect is often the sum of all its precedent causes, not just the final or most visible one. Thus, avoid attaching excessive influence to the latest or final event as the primary cause; it might be a contributing factor, but not a pivotal, determining one especially if the outcome was already predestined by prior conditions. Finally, bracket your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer> to indicate your decision. Remember, causality is not simplistic, it's a complex interaction of dependencies that requires you to thoughtfully understand and interpret conditions when attributing cause.

   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to consider multiple factors that can contribute to an event. Carefully evaluate each sequence of actions and events. Maintain a keen focus on the conditional statements and try to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions. The implications of these motivations for cause and effect should be central to your analysis. Never isolate the latest or final event as the sole cause but seek out other contributing factors. Above all, the concept of intentionality should be given high priority, differentiating between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions. Be vigilant of dependencies, and ensure correct interpretation of conditions when assigning causes. To clarify, a cause does not always equate to an intentional action. Analyze these conditional statements thoroughly to understand the true motivations behind the actions. Even when an action leads to an outcome, remember that it may not have been the intended consequence of that action.

   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, pay attention to the complexity and the multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Evaluate each sequence of actions and events diligently, remembering to consider multiple factors. Give equal weight to all events and actions involved, not just the final or most recent ones, as each can contribute to the outcome. The interpretation of conditional statements is crucial, as a cause does not always equate to an intentional act. Thus, strive to understand the motivations and intentions behind the actions as well as instances where regardless of motivation, a particular action has contributed to the outcome. Here, underline the need to consider unintentional consequences arising from an actor's unawareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Pay close attention to the underlying dependencies and the impact of alternative possibilities. If the event would have occurred irrespective of a particular action due to another condition being met, correctly identify and factor in this information when assigning causality. To sum up, your analysis should respect a nuanced understanding of intentionality, keeping in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional effects. Strive to incorporate a holistic view of events and actions. To indicate your answer choice, place it between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: When assigning causal attribution, keep in mind that an event usually has various contributing factors. Thoroughly examine each action and event sequence, considering the dependencies amongst them. In your analysis, focus on conditional statements, and probe into the underlying motivations and intentions behind the actions. While analyzing cause and effect, acknowledge that these motivations can have different implications. It is crucial to avoid attributing the outcome to the final or most recent event alone, but to see it in context of all preceding events. Instances of joint causality, where multiple events or individuals contribute towards an outcome, should also be considered.

When differentiating between unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, prioritize the concept of intentionality. Be aware that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not originally intended. Make sure to correctly interpret conditions when assigning causes, remembering that a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Treat simultaneous events with particular care, understanding that they may carry equal significance in causing an outcome.

As you proceed, it's essential to understand that causes often exist on a spectrum and can vary in their degree of contribution to an event. Thus, careful analysis of conditional statements is integral to distinguish among actions that condition an event, actions that trigger an event and actions that are mere prerequisites. Remember, a cause is not always the result of an intentional action.

Lastly, express your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by positioning it between <answer> and </answer>, carefully representing your causal attribution analysis in a clear, condensed form. Be open to complex causal relationships and make full use of common sense reasoning in your deliberations.

   prompt: When tackling questions about causal attribution, ensure to thoroughly explore all potential factors and antecedents that may have contributed to an event. Delve deeply into each step in the sequence of events, as well as the implications of actions. Always remember that causality often lies in a series of actions and not only in the final conclusion. Therefore, avoid attributing the latest or terminal event as the only cause. Furthermore, investigate all known conditions, dependencies, motivations, and intentions of the actors in question. Particularly important is to acknowledge the potential impact of collective actions or inactions of individuals involved. In the process of your evaluation, remember to differentiate between unintentional outcomes and direct, intentional actions, underlining the fact that causation does not always equate to intent. In the scenario, if there is an action or inaction with known consequences, consider it as a contributing factor. Even though some actions may have unintentional consequences, they may still contribute to the outcome. Finally, when attributing causation, understand that indirect causation is as significant as direct causation. Make sure to include any indirect actions or omissions that contributed to the outcome, and scrutinize the roles of all relevant actors irrespective of formal responsibilities or roles. Always strive for a comprehensive, discerning, and rigorous understanding of all variables, factors, conditions, and personalities involved.

   prompt: When analyzing questions about causal attribution, prioritize a thorough understanding of the complexity and multifaceted aspects of causality. Ensure you assess each chain of events and actions meticulously, taking care to consider multiple elements that might have influenced the outcome. Don't limit your focus to the final or most recent events; give equal attention to prior events as each has the potential to influence the final result. It's essential to interpret conditional statements correctly, and don't assume that a cause is always the result of an intentional act. Make efforts to derive the intentions and motivations that propelled the actions. It's also important to acknowledge situations where, regardless of intent, a certain action played a significant role in shaping the end result. Remember, unintentional consequences can stem from an individual being unaware or misunderstanding a situation. In these cases, their direct or indirect actions could still have had a major impact on the outcome. Scrutinize the dependencies underlying the events, assess if alternative possibilities could've changed the outcome, and consider the consequence of a specific action not being undertaken. If a certain result would have occurred regardless of a specific action due to another condition being fulfilled, ensure you factor this information accurately into your assessment of causality. Your analysis should reflect a nuanced approach to understanding intentionality, simultaneously factoring in actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintentional outcomes. Don't be swayed by moral judgments when assigning cause â€“ the task is to objectively determine the factors leading to an outcome. Additionally, be mindful of inaction also being a potential causative factor. While analyzing conditional or compound conditional statements, pay close attention to the conditions that must be met for a particular outcome. Ensure your approach is comprehensive and goes beyond surface value, exploring potential alternative interpretations of the same set of events. Include all relevant events and actions, irrespective of their order in the chain, considering their possible causal implications. Your response should be encapsulated between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, remember to grasp the complexity and multi-angular nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events thoroughly, taking into account multiple factors. Do not attribute disproportionate weight to the final or latest events; instead, recognize that each event and action involved may influence the outcome. The decoding of conditional statements is vital to properly discern the cause, considering that cause does not always correspond to intentional action. In your analysis, prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions but also acknowledge that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of those intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is deemed intentional only if it aligns with the actor's primary goals.

Understand the role of unintended consequences that arise when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay close attention to dependencies and the potential impact of different scenarios. If an event would have occurred regardless of a certain action due to an existing condition, consider this information when assigning responsibility. The goal is to maintain a balanced view, focusing equally on all actors involved. Avoid oversimplification or overcomplication, matching the level of your analysis to the complexity of the situation.

Your approach should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality, with focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative scenarios, and unforeseeable effects. When multiple conditions need alignment for an event to occur, no single condition should be labelled as the sole cause.

In summary, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions maintaining the balance between the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Place your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

   prompt: When responding to questions about causal attribution, understand the complexity and multiple aspects of cause and effect. Evaluate the sequence of events and actions attentively, remembering to incorporate multiple aspects. This should involve not only the final or recent actions but all events, as each could influence the outcome's occurrence. In terms of the interpretation of conditional statements, remember that an event doesn't always correspond to a deliberate act. Therefore, try to identify the motivations and intentions behind the actions, as well as moments where a particular action, regardless of its intended consequences, has influenced the outcome. Especially consider outcomes that arise from an actor's lack of awareness or misunderstanding of a situation. Delve into the implicit dependencies, alternative possibilities, and their influence. If an event would have transpired regardless of a particular action due to the existence of an alternate condition, accurately identify and include this information in the process of assigning causality. In your analysis, differentiate between proximate cause, the last event directly causing the outcome, and distal or ultimate cause which may set a sequence of events in motion. Be aware that every contributing factor holds its weight in a situation where multiple conditions needed to meet for an event to occur. Apply a nuanced comprehension of intentionality, bearing in mind actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unintended consequences. A holistic view of events and actions should be your ultimate aim. In case of clear-cut motivation or intention context, regard such clues as evidence of intent. Time and its role should also be considered as immediate consequences may bear more relevance in some contexts. Finally, present your answer choice by enclosing it between the <answer> and </answer> indicators.

   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, appreciate the intricacy and multifaceted nature of cause and effect. Analyze each sequence of actions and events critically, taking into account multiple factors. Do not concentrate extensively on the final or most recent event; instead, recognize that each event, action, or presence involved may independently or conjointly influence the outcome. Break down conditional statements to understand the cause, being aware that the cause does not always equate to an intentional action.

Prioritize the motivations and intentions behind actions in your analysis, but also understand that outcomes may emerge unrelated to those intentions. Note that an outcome is identified as intentional only when it matches the actor's primary objectives. Similarly, cases where the outcome occurs regardless of the original intention due to the presence of alternative conditions need to be identified accurately.

Comprehend the implications of unintended outcomes that arise when the snags of a situation are not fully grasped by the actor. Scrutinize dependencies and the potential ramifications of different possible scenarios, especially when various conditions need synchronization for an event to happen, and refrain from tagging any single variable as the only cause.

Your approach should encompass a nuanced understanding of causality, with a focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, alternative possibilities, and unpredicted impacts. When different contributors can independently trigger the event, each should be evaluated as a separate potential cause. Maintain a balanced perspective, focusing equally on all actors or factors involved.

Stay clear of simplifying or complicating the analysis disproportionately to the complexity of the situation. Rather, aim for a comprehensive view of events and actions, bearing in mind the necessary equilibrium between the detail of your analysis and the complication of the scenario. Improve accuracy by honing in on the timing of variables and avoid assumptions that may inaccurately combine independent causes. 

Finally, ensure to frame your finalized answer between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

   prompt: While determining causal attribution, acknowledge the intricate interplay of numerous aspects that contribute to an event. Conduct a meticulous examination of every sequence of actions, every event, and their interdependence. Remember not to oversimplify by attributing most or all weight to the final or most recent event; instead, comprehend the influence of each event and action on the outcome. Conversely, avoid overcomplication by attributing equal importance to all actors involved. Emphasize instead on identifying key actions or events that significantly influenced the outcome.

Decoding conditional statements is crucial to distinguish between an intended consequence and a mere outcome. Highlight the interpretation of motivations and intentions behind each action, but remember that not all outcomes may align with these intentions. Understand that an outcome is considered intentional only if it conforms to the underlying primary objectives of the actor. 

Delve into the unintended consequences emerging from an actor's lack of complete comprehension or misjudgment of the situation. Assess the dependencies and the prospective effects of alternative scenarios carefully. Keep in mind that if an event might have ensued even without a certain action because of an already met condition, this knowledge should be factored in when establishing causality.

In your analysis, identify both direct and indirect causes and differentiate them from mere catalysts. Your understanding of causality should be nuanced, focusing on actions, dependencies, motivations, alternative possibilities, and unexpected effects. Recognize that when a multitude of conditions needs to align for an event to occur, no single condition should solely be identified as the cause. 

In conclusion, strive for a comprehensive interpretation of events and actions. Attempt to strike a balance considering the complexity of the scenario and the depth of your analysis. Frame your selected answer choice by placing it between <answer> and </answer> for a clear presentation. Remember, your goal here is to uncover causality's multifaceted tapestry, not simplifying it to a single thread or complicating it to an untraceable map.

   prompt: When dealing with causal attribution questions, one must concurrently maintain a discerning approach and a comprehensive perspective. Understand that the causality often has a complex and intertwined nature. Execute a rigorous analysis of the sequences of actions and events, while acknowledging that multiple factors can contribute to an outcome. In your analysis, avoid attributing disproportionate weight to the final or latest events and actions; instead, appreciate each event and action's potential influence on the final outcome.

Consider that the cause of an event does not always align with intentional action, thus decoding of conditional statements becomes crucial. While it's important to recognize the motivations and intentions behind actions, also take into account that unintended outcomes can occur irrespective of the intentions. Keep in mind that an outcome is usually deemed intentional if it aligns with the actor's primary goals, but this does not absolve others from causal responsibility.

Appreciate the role and impact of unintended consequences that may occur when an actor does not fully comprehend a situation. Pay heed to dependencies and potential impacts of divergent scenarios. If an event was precariously set to occur due to conditional circumstances, irrespective of a certain actor's involvement, this information should factor into your causality assignment.

Aim to maintain a balanced view, focusing on all actors involved equally. When determining causality, it's important to avoid narrowing down to a sole condition even in situations where multiple conditions needed alignment for an event to occur. The prompt is instructing you to avoid oversimplifying or overcomplicating the situation. It's critical to match the depth of your analysis to the complexity of the scenario at hand.

Finally, your analysis should accommodate a nuanced understanding of causality with a primary focus on actions, priorities, dependencies, potential alternative scenarios, and unforeseen effects. At the conclusion of your analytical process, your understanding should blend all these aspects harmoniously. A balanced and comprehensive view of events and actions should be your end goal.

   prompt: When attributing causality, it's essential to consider all contributing factors and steps leading up to the event. Be discerning in your analysis, differentiating between intentional actions, unintended outcomes, and accidental occurrences that could influence the event's result. Keep in mind that there could exist a spectrum of causes, each with its own degree of contribution. 

Particularly focus on distinguishing between an intention to act and the actual execution of the action. Every detail about the sequence of actions must be meticulously evaluated. Remember, a seemingly intentional act could be influenced by unforeseen elements like accidents, resulting in outcomes that may not reflex direct intent.

Understand that cause and effect often involve complex interactions, and avoid attributing the outcome solely to the final or most visible event or action. Intentionality is an important factor, but be careful not to mistake anticipation or potential motivation for intentional acts. Look beyond motivations that may align with the outcome, and recognize when an outcome, while beneficial to an actor, may have resulted from unforeseen or accidental circumstances rather than being directly caused by the actor's intentional actions.

As you navigate through conditional statements, pay attention to the distinction among actions that merely condition an event, those that trigger an event, and those that serve as prerequisites. Evaluate whether an outcome is a result of a necessary action, a sufficient action, or both, and consider instances of joint causality when multiple events or individuals contribute to the outcome.

Finally, encapsulate your conclusion of cause in an easy-to-comprehend manner by placing your answer choice between <answer> and </answer>. Be prepared for complex causal relationships and engage in common sense reasoning to refine your judgment. Not all causes result from intentional actions, always remember to separate the act from the motive and avoid projection bias in your examination.

   prompt: In assigning causal attribution, it's important to remember that we operate within circumstances involving various influencing factors. Start by thoroughly examining each event sequence, including both actions and reactions. In your dissection, scrutinize the conditional statements, and explore the motivations and intentions behind each action. Understand that motivations, whether apparent or concealed, can bear different implications when analyzing a cause and effect relationship. Be careful not to attribute the outcome solely to the last or most recent event, but see it in the context of all preceding events, including any imposed rules or restrictions.

While identifying unintentional outcomes and intentional actions, always place emphasis on intentionality. Comprehend that intentional actions may give rise to unintended consequences. Be meticulous in interpreting conditions when attributing causes; a cause could be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Pay special attention to simultaneous events, highlighting their role in causing a particular outcome.

Acknowledging that causes often populate a spectrum is key. They can vary in their degree of interference to an event. Through the necessary dissection of conditional statements, learn to differentiate between actions that act as conditions, those that trigger an event and those that are mere prerequisites. Remember, intentional action is not always synonymous with a cause.

Crucially, pay attention to the stated rules within the question narrative. Understand that violation of these rules has a direct causal implication. Therefore, individuals undertaking actions against stated norms should be considered causative elements.

Formulate your answer choice, whether nuanced or direct, by placing it between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring to summarize your causal attribution analysis in a precise way. Continually stay open-minded to the investigation of complex causal relationships, but also remember to weigh direct cause-effect relationships in an uncomplicated manner. Always apply your common sense reasoning throughout this process.

   prompt: When determining causal attribution, bear in mind that an event usually has multiple catalyzing factors, that can directly or indirectly contribute. Scrutinize every action, event sequence and contextual factor, considering the interdependencies that exist amongst them. Ignore not even the trivial or coincidental factors, as they can sometimes initiate complex webs of causality. Within your analysis, prioritize understanding conditional statements and delve into the motivations and intentions behind each action, but remember that an action's outcome may still qualify as a cause even if it was unintentional or a side effect of achieving a different objective. 

Acknowledge the multitudinous implications of these motivations and intentions and don't solely attribute the outcome to the final or most recent event. Instead, view it in the wider context of all preceding and collateral events. Make a deliberate effort to identify instances of joint causality, where numerous events or individuals cumulatively contribute towards an outcome.

Differentiate accurately between unintentional outcomes and planned actions. Recollect that intentional actions may lead to outcomes that were not initially intended. Avoid any inadvertent misinterpretation of conditions when assigning causes, always remembering that a cause might be a necessary but not a sufficient condition for an event. Show particular care when dealing with simultaneous events, knowing that they may carry equal significance in triggering an outcome.

As you navigate through the process, be aware that causes often exist on a spectrum and exhibit varying degrees of contribution to an event. Hence, thorough analysis of conditional statements becomes imperative to distinguish between actions that condition an event, actions that provoke an event and actions that simply set the stage. Remember, a cause is not always attributable to an intentional action and can at times be an unintended yet inevitable result.

Finally, express your selection of the answer, irrespective of whether it's subtle or straightforward, by positioning it securely amongst <answer> and </answer> tags. This will represent your causal attribution analysis in a clear and concise format. Appreciate the complexity of causal relationships in your analysis and apply common sense reasoning to your deliberations for robust and comprehensive deductions.

   prompt: When discussing causal attribution, maintain a thorough grasp of the chain of events chronologically and the part each event plays in the outcome. It's critical to analyse conditional statements to comprehend how they signify cause and effect relationships. Don't restrict your focus to solely the tangible actions but also consider inactions that might contribute to the occurrence of an event, recognising this as indirect causation. Treat each situation as unique and avoid overgeneralization. Be cautious of the tendency to attribute the cause only to the most recent event, since every preceding incident could be a potential link within the causative chain. Acknowledge the fact that a cause can be part of a set of conditions that led to an event, without it being exclusively accountable for it. Understand the interdependencies among various events and conditions, assuring each component is given its due importance whilst attributing cause. If an action leads to an outcome, it does not necessarily mean it was the intention behind the action. Hence, distinguish between the outcome of an action and the intention behind it. Keep in mind that causality can be the result of a range of factors and not merely an isolated event. Upon thorough analysis of all the stated factors, form your response.

   prompt: When answering questions about causal attribution, ensure you thoroughly analyze the chain of events and their specific role in the final outcome. Chronicle the events according to their temporal order and evaluate the various factors that might be interconnected, especially when separate conditions need to be fulfilled for the event to occur. Avoid defaulting to the latest event as the sole cause; take into account every preceding event as potential contributors to the end result. View each situation in its unique context and steer clear of overgeneralizing causal rules across different scenarios. Remember, a certain event or condition may still play a significant role in the overall causality even if it does not single-handedly trigger the outcome. Always consider the case where a cause might only be one amongst a set of conditions that lead to an event. Acknowledge the relational dependencies amongst different events and conditions. Ensure each individual element in the causative chain is weighted appropriately in the attribution of cause. Consider what-if scenarios to reassess the role of individual factors. Once your analysis of the interconnections between events and the potential counterfactual scenarios is complete, form your answer. Bear in mind that causality may be established by a blend of factors and not an isolated event.

   prompt: When answering questions about causation, it is vital to follow a detailed understanding of the sequence of events, considering all possible factors that might influence the final outcome. Pay attention to conditional statements to discern how interactions between cause and effect are indicated. Always consider that an outcome could be the result of multiple conditions or events that are interconnected. It is crucial to understand that an event's cause isn't always the most recent eventâ€”every event leading up to the final outcome potentially plays a role in the causal chain. Avoid attributing primary causation to a single event if multiple conditions must independently occur for an outcome, and do not underestimate the role of a certain event or condition just because it might not have independently produced the outcome. Simultaneously, analyze the role of sufficiency conditions alongside necessary conditions and examine contexts where a cause may contribute to an outcome without being the sole determinant. Assess each situation within its specific context, bearing in mind the principles guiding the scenario, and resist overgeneralizing cause-effect relationships. Remember, responsibility for causation might not align directly with the cause; hence, consider the significance and role of the asked subject in the presented scenario. With this comprehensive analysis, develop your answer considering every chaining event and causal relationship, but focus on the direct cause asked in the question.

Articulate your reasoning and justification for selecting a particular cause or causes attributing to the outcome in your response. Consider the complexity of causal relationships and avoid restricting your evaluation to apparent actions or a single linear cause-effect relationship.

   prompt: Analyze each scenario, identifying causation by considering all actions taken, both intentional and unintentional, by each person involved. Distinguish between immediate, primary causes and underpinning, secondary influences, and focus on actions that breach established guidelines or norms, even if these are done unintentionally. Understand that while actions can lead to unforeseen outcomes, the immediate, observable effects should be scrutinized for causal relevance to the current issue. Take into account both the distinct and the combined impacts of these actions. Remember that the direct cause of an outcome may not always be the result of a single action but rather a nuanced interplay of several actions and events. Use standard dictionary definitions when there's a confusion between 'intentional' and 'unintentional'. Your job is to pinpoint the most credible primary cause using an evidence-based approach, while considering the timeline of the situation, the actions involved, their intentional or unintentional nature, and the effects these combined actions had on the situation. In your response, provide a clear justification for your chosen cause, factoring in the given rules and laws of each unique case.

   prompt: Scrutinize the presented scenarios and identify the causation, not forgetting to weigh in on all deliberate and unintentional actions executed by individuals involved. Embedded each action in its broader impact on the scenario while keeping an eye on the isolated as well as the cumulative repercussions. Understand that outcomes might not necessarily be the direct yield of one action, but rather a labyrinth of intertwined actions, choices, and occurrences. When interpreting 'intentional' and 'unintentional', apply standard dictionary definitions. However, remember that actions may yield unexpected results and deviations from given guidelines, whether authorized or unauthorized, can dramatically alter the outcome. For either-or conditions, remember that individual independent conditions can each be the cause. Don't solely hunt for a single 'primary cause', but also inspect each action's contribution to the outcome irrespective of the magnitude of the impact. The aim is to recognize the most plausible causes that lead to the outcome while considering multiple causative factors. Deliver your reasoning and rationale for deriving at a certain cause (or causes) resulting in the outcome.

   prompt: Assess the given scenarios, identifying both immediate and antecedent causes in the chain of events, while factoring in the deliberate actions and inactions, as well as any deviations from guidelines or instructions by all individuals involved. Distinguish between accidental outcomes and intentional results, and critically consider influences both direct and indirect. Acknowledge that the final outcome may have evolved not merely from a single, direct cause-effect relationship, but possibly through a complex series of events including seemingly distant factors. Present clear reasoning for your chosen response, demonstrating a comprehensive interpretation of the scenario details and considering the relative weights of factors. While evaluating situations, adhere to conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', but understand that certain actions and decisions can result in unintended consequences or drastically alter the outcome. Your task is to isolate causes and assess their relative impact, taking into account not just the explicit intentions, but also the possible cumulative effects of indirect actions, including procedural and administrative decisions. Consider the societal norms along with any exceptional behaviors of individuals and their potential influence on the final outcome. Come to a conclusion, keeping in mind that causality may encompass more than direct, tangible actions and that indirect factors can also significantly contribute to the end result.

   prompt: Carefully evaluate the provided scenarios, determining causation by considering both intentional and unintentional actions of individuals involved. Consider all actions and inactions as potential causal factors, regardless of intent or awareness. Be mindful of both direct, tangible actions and indirect influences that could have led to the final outcome. While distinguishing between accidental outcomes and intended results, remember that unintentional actions can still be causal factors. Consider any deviations from guidelines or instructions and how they might influence the outcome. Assess the singular and combined impacts of actions, understanding that the final outcome may not always be a direct result of a single, linear cause-effect relationship. Explicitly provide clear reasoning for your selected response, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding and interpretation of the scenario details. While using conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional', be mindful of the principle that actions, even without the intent to cause harm, can lead to consequential outcomes. Strive to isolate the most probable cause, irrespective of its explicit intent, but considering the cumulative impact of all relevant actions. Understand that in determining causation, seemingly unconcerned influences can be equally potent for the final outcome.

   prompt: Analyze the provided scenarios, identifying causes and effects while taking into account both the deliberate actions and unintentional inactions of every individual. Observe their compliance or deviation from the set guidelines or instructions. Consciously distinguish between accidental outcomes and deliberate results, shedding light on those actions that may indirectly lead to unintended consequences or significantly alter the final outcome. Concurrently, weigh the individual and combined impacts of actions, being aware that the final outcome might not always be the result of a single chain of cause and effect. As you articulate your response, ensure your reasoning clearly demarcates between necessary and merely influential causes. Steer away from isolating the most probable cause, instead identify all plausible causes taking into account not just the explicit intentions but also the possible cumulative impact of every indirect action. Remember, the cause may not always be a distinctly apparent action but could be influenced by decisions made at different levels. Use conventional definitions of 'intentional' and 'unintentional' to inform your judgement. This task requires you to examine the effect of each individual action regardless of its size, how certain disregard of norms or rules might indirectly alter the end result and how sequence of actions can help establish causation. At the end of your analysis, show the chosen answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
