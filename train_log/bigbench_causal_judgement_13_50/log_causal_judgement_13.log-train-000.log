Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

1a. Issue: The prompt requires the model to answer questions about causal attribution, but it does not clarify how to measure or determine causality. Because of this, the model tends to select a simplistic interpretation.
1b. Analysis: The model identified the pharmacist as a contributor to the patient's recovery because they were part of the approval process for the drug. However, the pharmacist's role is only for inventory, not deciding to administer the drug. The wrong interpretation of causality made the model choose the incorrect answer.
1c. Corrective Action: The prompt should include cues or frameworks for the model to evaluate causality correctly, perhaps considering individual roles and their responsibilities in an event.

Wrong Example 2:

2a. Issue: Similarly, the model made a wrong causal attribution due to a simplistic interpretation of events. The prompt didn't provide any explicit rules for determining cause and effect.
2b. Analysis: The model marked Alice as the cause of an empty email being sent, as she logged in while Zoe was already logged in. But her causal attribution is wrong because Zoe's actions violated the established policy and caused the event.
2c. Corrective Actions: The prompt should have indications to consider orders of events and rules, norms, or policies in place when making a causal attribution.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Provide clearer instructions about how to consider causality: For example, the model could be encouraged to consider individual roles, responsibilities, and the order of events.
2. Ask the model to consider governing rules, policies, norms, or established patterns before making causal attributions.
3. Consider asking the model to evaluate the likelihood of different attributions of causality, rather than making a binary decision. This would give the model more leeway to consider and balance different factors that might influence an outcome.
4. Encourage the model to consider the counterfactual scenario – what would have happened, if the person/event in question did not occur.

gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the model incorrectly determined that Jim turning on his lamp did not cause the circuit breaker to fail when in fact it did. This likely occurred because of the phrasing of the question and the model's potential misunderstanding of the simultaneous action. The model seems to be associating causation with sole responsibility, while in this case, the causation is shared among three individuals. 

<2> 
In the second example, the error seems to result from the model not taking into account the fact that the clothes would have dried in 60 minutes with the original settings. Therefore changing the settings to HIGH was not the cause. In this case, the model may have associated change in status (David changed the setting to HIGH) with the cause, which is incorrect in this scenario. This shows that the model fails to understand that the effects would have occurred anyway due to the already set MAX DRY cycle.

<3> 
In the third example, the model incorrectly answered the question by attributing the cause to the black wire touching the battery when it should have been attributed to the red wire touching the battery. In this case, the model got confused by the fact that the black wire was supposed to touch the battery resulting in a misunderstanding on which was the aberrant and causative factor.

Based on these examples, the reasons for errors seem to be:
- Misunderstanding simultaneous causation 
- Misassociating change in status with causation
- Misunderstanding the aberrant, or unusual, event as the cause

To improve the prompt:
- Explicitly state that causation can be due to multiple factors working simultaneously.
- Ask the model to consider the event or factor that is abnormal or different from the usual routine.
- Stress that changing a factor doesn't necessarily mean it becomes the cause especially if the outcome was pre-determined or unchanged.
- Guide the model to independently evaluate circumstances, not always consider them dependent on each other.
- Emphasize understanding the full context of the situation instead of making assumptions based on individual events.

gradient:
Example 1:

In this example, the model seems to be struggling with understanding the logical order of events and the clearly defined company policy. The model incorrectly seems to attribute the cause of the empty email to the person who logged in second (Alice) rather than recognizing the fact that because Zoe broke the company policy, she is in fact the one who caused the email to be sent. 

Example 2:

The model incorrectly deemed that David changing the temperature setting to HIGH caused the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. However, the passage clearly states that the clothes would dry in sixty minutes either if the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is on HIGH. The model seems to be misunderstanding the "or" logical operator and is incorrectly assigning the causality to David's action while it was already set by the cycle being on MAX DRY. 

Example 3:

The model incorrectly predicts that Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. However, the question clearly states that if three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The model seems to be overlooking the collective effect of multiple actions happening simultaneously and attributing the cause on individual basis.

To improve the prompt:
1. It can be stated in the instructions that the model should carefully look at the order of the events and understand who actually broke any rules or policies, if any, as it might be crucial to correct attribution.
2. The model should be programmed to understand the combinational nature of certain actions. If multiple events lead to the same aftermath, the model should be able to correctly attribute the causality to the first event that made the aftermath inevitable.
3. The model should be trained to recognize the collective effect of multiple actions happening simultaneously and leading to the same outcome rather than attributing the cause solely on a singular action. 
4. It may also useful to highlight in the task instructions that the model should not assume causality where no causal link has been explicitly stated in the question.
5. The model should be trained to better understand and interpret logical operators as they are essential in determining causality.

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is:

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

In this example, the model seems to be struggling with understanding the logical order of events and the clearly defined company policy. The model incorrectly seems to attribute the cause of the empty email to the person who logged in second (Alice) rather than recognizing the fact that because Zoe broke the company policy, she is in fact the one who caused the email to be sent. 

Example 2:

The model incorrectly deemed that David changing the temperature setting to HIGH caused the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. However, the passage clearly states that the clothes would dry in sixty minutes either if the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is on HIGH. The model seems to be misunderstanding the "or" logical operator and is incorrectly assigning the causality to David's action while it was already set by the cycle being on MAX DRY. 

Example 3:

Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

gradient:
<1> 
Question Analysis: 
The question here is primarily about causal attribution and asks whether Jane caused the computer to crash. The background story provided indicates that the computer tends to crash when two people are logged in simultaneously. Jane logs in at the same time as Lauren, disregarding the company's policy, and the computer crashes. 

Wrong Answer Analysis: 
The model incorrectly analyzes the situation by stating that Jane's action alone did not cause the crash; instead, it is caused by the computer's inability to support two users logged onto it simultaneously. The model seems to be focusing on distributing causation evenly between different factors, but in this case, a direct relationship between Jane's action and the crash is more apparent.

<2> 
Question Analysis: 
The question here asks if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. In the situation described, Bob was informed about how their actions would lead to severe health consequences for the townspeople, and he still continued with the plan.

Wrong Answer Analysis: 
The model incorrectly answers "Yes," misunderstanding Bob's intentional negligence and indifference towards the health consequences as an intent to harm. This could be because the model is incorrectly assimilating the factors around the situation and attributing the overall harm solely to Bob, disregarding the fact that his focus was only on stealing money, not causing harm to the townspeople.

Improvement Aspects for Prompt: 

1. Emphasize Direct Cause: Make sure the model assigns causality to the direct cause if it is possible, even if the situation includes other co-existing factors. The prompt needs to stress on evaluating the immediate cause-effect relationships rather than assigning causation to every related event.

2. Context Comprehension: The prompt should be modified to emphasize comprehending the situations in their complete context by focusing on the motives and intents of individuals involved. 

3. Intent Evaluation: The prompt should instruct the model to correctly evaluate intent by paying attention to explicit expressions of intent, rather than guessing or associating it with other factors/events.

4. Interactions: Make the prompt stress on comprehending interactions and chain reactions, allowing the model to understand the complex web of actions and causes they lead to. 

5. Factor Weighting: The prompt should persuade the model to correctly distinguish and weigh different factors contributing to an event, prioritizing relevancy and directness over mere presence.

An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision did not cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug itself, not the doctor's decision to administer it. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The model misinterprets the question because it seems to follow the assumption that the black wire is supposed to touch the battery, thus it doesn’t see this action as a cause to the problem. While the prompt instructions do ask the language model to consider each individual factor individually, in this case it appears the model failed to account for the requirement of simultaneous actions for the short circuit to occur. It only considers one wire at a time and doesn't fully analyze the situation considering the simultaneous action of both wires touching the battery together as the cause of the short circuit. Also, the model failed to correctly implement the instruction of “keeping in mind that causation can be a result of simultaneous actions”.

Example 2:
In the second example, the wording of the prompt appears to encourage the model to overly focus on the direct cause (the drug) of the patient's recovery, without adequately considering the necessary proximate events (the doctor's and pharmacist's approvals). The model gets this wrong because, even though the drug caused the patient's recovery, the doctor played a crucial role in allowing the drug to be administered by signing off despite the hospital's policy. 

Improvements:
1. Clarify and emphasize in the instructions the need to consider both direct and indirect causation. In effect, the model should understand that a chain of actions (like the series of approvals in the second example) can lead to a certain outcome.
2. The prompt needs to remind the model to better understand and analyze the role of simultaneous actions/events as potential causes. 
3. Clearly state in the prompt that the cause of an event can be a series of steps/actions rather than just the final action. In other words, causation often involves a chain of events, and dismissing or failing to recognize proximate causes can lead to inaccurate conclusions.
4. The model should be reminded to avoid first impression bias when considering causation. In both example prompts, the first factors introduced (the black wire, the intern's decision to administer the drug) seem to have unduly influenced the model's understanding of causation. 
5. Enhance instructions to the model to apply a more holistic approach while evaluating pre-conditions required for a particular outcome. It needs to appreciate multiple factors working in unison to cause an outcome.

In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob?

Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

The prompt here essentially wants the language model to critically analyze the given situation, considering all possible variables before attributing a specific cause. 

The model's wrong answer likely stems from a common misconception that because the black wire touching the battery is a necessary condition for the machine to short circuit, it is also the sole cause. According to the information provided in the scenario, the short circuit is caused by BOTH the black and red wires touching the battery at the same time. While the black wire touching the battery is part of the cause, it is incorrect to state that it is the sole causative factor, which the language model did.

The prompt didn't articulate sufficiently the importance of considering cases where multiple factors are required for a specific outcome and where all factors are just as significant in bringing about the outcome. 

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

In this scenario, the model seemed to confuse the means (robbing the bank and thereby releasing the neurotoxin) with the intention (which was solely to steal as much money as possible). Although Bob's action led to harming the townspeople, his intention was not to harm them. He was indifferent to their fate, suggesting his intention was not directed at their well-being. The model inaccurately assigned causation between Bob's actions and the townspeople's ill health.

The prompt did not clearly explain that causation should be separated from intention. The intention should be evaluated based on the expressed or implied purpose of the person or event in question, not just the result of the actions themselves.

Prompt Improvement Ideas:

1. Emphasize the importance of analyzing all the involved factors equally in cases where multiple factors contribute to the outcome. Clarify that all contributing factors to an event should be considered as part of the cause.
   
2. Suggest that intentionality should be judged based on the explicit and implied motivations of the person or event under scrutiny, not strictly on the outcome of their actions. 

3. Encourage considering potential for multiple, simultaneous causes and the complexity this brings to attributing causation.

4. Reinforce that causation and correlation are not the same and that correlation does not automatically imply causation.

5. Reiterate that a factor's usual contribution to an outcome cannot be solely relied upon - each scenario should be assessed on its own merits. 

6. Stress the model to keep considering that any change in factors does not necessarily infer causation.

7. Increase emphasis on considering aberrant events.

prompt: Systematically analyze scenarios to correctly ascribe causal attribution. Consider each individual factor and event in depth, noting that causation can be a product of multiple actions occurring simultaneously and understanding that a shift in variables doesn't necessarily dictate causation. Be meticulous in evaluating whether outcomes were predetermined or unaffected by specified changes. Offer undivided attention to abnormal and outlier events differing from the norm, scrutinizing situations in isolation, without always linking them together. Grasp the entire context of the situation, refraining from assumptions based solely on independent events.

cur_prompt: Approach each situation with a holistic understanding and analyze it for causal attribution by examining all factors and events. Remember that an outcome may result from a combination of simultaneous actions, and a change in an individual factor does not always infer causation. Evaluate the likelihood of outcomes being pre-determined or affected by the given changes. Pay particular attention to unexpected events and situations that differ from the norm, keeping in mind that a chain of actions can lead to a certain outcome. Avoid first impression bias and do not hastily assign causation based on the initial factors introduced. Furthermore, remember that causation often involves a series of steps or actions, so any single event should not be solely considered as the direct cause. Understand that an event can have multiple causes working together leading to the outcome. Use these guidelines to provide a nuanced answer to following questions about causal attribution in which you identify both direct and indirect causes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question with option (A) Yes, attributing the cause of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes to him changing the temperature setting. However, a more nuanced analysis would consider both direct and indirect causes. In this scenario, the direct cause of David's clothes drying in sixty minutes is the temperature setting being changed to HIGH. The indirect cause is the initial setting of the cycle to MAX DRY, which also contributes to the outcome. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(A) Yes</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1>
Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model incorrectly assigned causation to David changing the temperature to HIGH. It made this error even after the prompt explicitly stated that a single event should not be solely considered as the direct cause, and gave complex instructions for considering all factors and events. David’s clothes dried in sixty minutes not just because David changed the temperature setting, but also because the dryer was already set to MAX DRY, meaning either of these conditions alone would have achieved the desired result.

Reason for the mistake:

1. Shared Causation: The model may have struggled with the concept of shared causation - two separate conditions (MAX DRY and HIGH temperature) that can cause the same result independently. The prompt may not have sufficiently emphasized considering cases of simultaneous or alternative causes.

2. Lack of Emphasis on Existing State: The model may not have fully taken into account the initial state of the situation, where the dryer was already set to MAX DRY. The prompt did mention examining all factors and events, but it might not have placed enough emphasis on the importance of pre-existing conditions in assessing causation. 

3. Overemphasis on Changed Variables: The model might have overestimated the significance of the actively changed variable (temperature setting) and underestimated the static variable (dry state), leading to wrong causation attribution. The prompt may have inadvertently encouraged this by reminding to evaluate situations affected by given changes.

Based on the above analyzation, here are some aspects that can be improved in the prompt:

1. Strengthen the importance of simultaneous or alternative causes, explicitly instruct the model to pay attention to cases where more than one cause can lead to the same effect independently.

2. Emphasize examining the initial state of the situation and recognizing the value of 'unchanged' or 'passive' variables in determining causation.

3. Specify that the presence or introduction of a new factor does not automatically assign it more causative value. Demand a balanced assessment between all variables, whether they have been changed, maintained, or introduced. 

4. Encourage the model to understand the difference between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' causes. Specifically, ask it to identify whether a cause was necessary for an effect to happen, or if it was merely sufficient in the presence of other potential causes. This will help the model correctly interpret situations where multiple conditions can independently lead to the same outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision did not directly cause the patient's recovery. While the doctor's signature allowed for the administration of the drug, it was ultimately the drug itself that led to the patient's recovery. The recovery could be attributed to the drug's effectiveness in alleviating the kidney problems. Therefore, the attending doctor's decision can be seen as an indirect cause of the patient's recovery.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example <1>, the model seemed to misinterpret the concept of direct and indirect causation. While the model correctly acknowledged that the doctor's approval was an indirect cause, it misunderstands that the approval allowed the direct cause (the administration of the drug) to occur. Therefore, the model didn't grasp the idea that a chain of actions may lead to an event and each step, including the initial one (the doctor's approval in this case), plays a crucial role in the end result.

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:

1. Misunderstanding of Causal Hierarchy: The model doesn't seem to fully understand the difference between direct and indirect causes. It recognized that the doctor's signature was necessary for the drug to be administered and thereby effecting the recovery (which means it did have a causal influence), but it incorrectly labelled this as not causing the recovery.

2. Neglecting the Chain of Actions: The prompt instructs the model to consider a chain of actions leading to an outcome. Despite this, the model didn't seem to consider that the doctor signing off, led to the administration of the drug, which then led to the recovery. 

3. Overemphasis on the Direct Cause: The model seems to have overemphasized the direct cause (the drug), ignoring the other steps leading to its administration.

To improve the prompt:

1. Clarify understanding of 'Cause': Provide clear distinctions often between direct and indirect causes, emphasizing that both are imperative as 'causes' in the chain of events leading to the outcome.

2. Emphasis on Event Sequence: Stress the understanding that cause often involves a series of steps or actions that eventually lead to a certain outcome.

3. Reinforce Complexity of Causation: Reinforce multiple times in the instruction that causation doesn't always have to be a direct relationship between two events, instead it can involve a series of events (some may be indirect) that facilitates the occurrence of the outcome.

4. Explain Bias Towards Direct Causes: Expressly caution against overvaluing the direct causes and disregarding the stages that led to this direct cause. The model should be prompted to carefully consider the chain of cause and effect.

4. Explain Bias Towards Direct Causes: Expressly caution against overvaluing the direct causes and disregarding the stages that led to this direct cause. The model should be prompted to carefully consider the chain of cause and effect.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze situations to accurately assign causal attribution by considering each individual factor and event, keeping in mind that causation can be a result of simultaneous actions, and that any change in factors does not necessarily infer causation. Evaluate whether outcomes were pre-determined or not affected by given changes. Pay careful attention to aberrant events and events that differ from routine, and evaluate circumstances independently, not always considering them dependent on each other. Understand the full context of the situation and avoid assumptions based solely on individual events. Use this understanding to answer the following questions about causal attribution.
(2) Approach each situation with a holistic understanding and analyze it for causal attribution by examining all factors and events. Remember that an outcome may result from a combination of simultaneous actions, and a change in an individual factor does not always infer causation. Evaluate the likelihood of outcomes being pre-determined or affected by the given changes. Pay particular attention to unexpected events and situations that differ from the norm, keeping in mind that a chain of actions can lead to a certain outcome. Avoid first impression bias and do not hastily assign causation based on the initial factors introduced. Furthermore, remember that causation often involves a series of steps or actions, so any single event should not be solely considered as the direct cause. Understand that an event can have multiple causes working together leading to the outcome. Use these guidelines to provide a nuanced answer to following questions about causal attribution in which you identify both direct and indirect causes.

response:
<START> Engage with each situation through a comprehensive, multi-perspective approach as you delve into causal attribution by scrutinizing all factors and events. Understand that outcomes are often not a result of a single event or action, but rather, a sequence of interconnected events potentially occurring simultaneously. A change in a single component does not inherently determine causation. Assess the probability of outcomes being predetermined or influenced by certain changes. Be particularly mindful of unexpected events or those deviating from usual norms, understanding that a sequence of progressive actions can lead to a final outcome. Be wary of initial bias, preventing hasty causation assignment solely based on the initial elements introduced. Grasp that causation typically involves a series of steps or actions; therefore, no single event should be given full priority as the direct cause. Recognize that an event can have a mix of causes working in tandem to yield an outcome, involving both direct and indirect causes. A direct cause is an event that immediately prompts or produces an outcome, while indirect causes play a role in producing the direct cause or setting up conditions for an event. Avoid overemphasizing on just the direct cause and neglecting the stages leading up to it. Utilize this broadened understanding of complex causation, along with the multi-layered nature of cause and effect, to provide detailed and thoughtful responses to the following questions about causal attribution where both direct and indirect causes are identified. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Louie did not win the $100 bet solely because he made the layup. The direct cause of him winning the bet was making both the layup and the 3-point shot, as per the conditions of the bet. Therefore, the correct answer is:
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly cause the circuit breaker to fail. The direct cause of the circuit breaker failing was the simultaneous action of three people turning on their lamps at the same time. While Jim's action of turning on his lamp contributed to the overall load on the circuit, it was the combined actions of Carol, Bob, and Jim that led to the failure. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople, we need to consider both direct and indirect causes. In this scenario, Bob's actions directly led to the release of neurotoxins in the air, which ultimately caused harm to the townspeople's health. Bob's primary motivation was to steal money, but he was fully aware of the potential consequences of his actions on the townspeople's health and chose to proceed with the plan regardless. Therefore, Bob can be attributed with intentionally harming the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: "Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?"
Prompt Rationale: The prompt addresses multi-causality of direct and indirect causes. Thus, the question's response reflects that the model considered both the layup and the 3-point shot as direct causes for Louie winning the bet.
Model's Wrong Answer Reason: The model interpreted the combination of events as all required for the causation to occur. However, the bet conditions stated that Louie would win if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot. This means Louie making the layup alone was sufficient enough for him to win the bet.
Error In Analysis: Misunderstanding the logical correlation between events.

<2>
Question: "Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?"
Prompt Rationale: The prompt emphasizes that an outcome may result from a combination of simultaneous actions and an individual factor does not always infer causation.
Model's Wrong Answer Reason: The model recognized the simultaneous action of Jim, Carol, and Bob turning on their lamps as a multi-causal event and deduced that no singular event is the direct cause.
Error in Analysis: The model overlooked the fact that each of the individual actions - Jim, Carol, and Bob turning on their lamps - all directly lead to the outcome, and each action independently is also a cause.

<3> 
Question: "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?"
Prompt Rationale: The prompt instructs the model to pay particular attention to unexpected events and situations that differ from the norm. In this case, Bob's intentions towards the town's health.
Model's Wrong Answer Reason: The model misconstrued Bob's indifference towards the health of the townspeople as an intent to harm. This, however, was a misunderstanding of the meaning of "intent." Bob did not care about the well-being of the townspeople, but this does not mean he intentioned for their harm.
Error in Analysis: Misinterpretation of the concept of intention.

To improve the prompt:
1) Emphasize on discerning the difference between 'essential conditions' and 'contributing factors.' Not all causes are required for an effect.
2) Ask the model to recognize each action's independent capability to cause an outcome in multi-causal events.
3) Improve understanding of fundamental concepts like 'intention' by including a wider semantic understanding of such concepts.
4) Encourage the model to pay closer attention to the question's specific context rather than following the general guidelines too strictly.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for it to charge. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged. Therefore, the correct answer is:
(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on administering the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. While the drug may have contributed to the patient's recovery, it cannot be solely attributed to the doctor's decision. The recovery could have been influenced by various factors such as the patient's overall health, other treatments received, and the natural course of the illness. Therefore, the attending doctor's decision cannot be definitively identified as the cause of the patient's recovery.

A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit. The setup of the machine clearly states that a short circuit will occur if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. Therefore, the black wire touching the battery was the direct cause of the short circuit.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In the first example, the model did not correctly interpret the context given in the prompt that causation can be a product of multiple actions occurring simultaneously. There seems to be some confusion regarding the role of human interaction and technological requirements in the charging of the device. The model completely rules out Wayne's non-action (not moving the device) as having no causative influence. However, in the real-world context, inaction can also lead to causation. Wayne's inaction (not moving the device from the charging pad) indirectly allowed the device to continue charging, thus his inaction was a causal factor.

<2>
In the second example, the model oversimplified and misunderstood what causal attribution means. The attending doctor's decision was instrumental in the administration of the drug, which eventually led to the patient's recovery. Thus, it can be inferred that his decision was a causal factor in the patient's recovery. Despite mentioning the complexity of attributing causation when there are multiple, simultaneous causes in the prompt, the model failed to recognize the interplay between the doctor's decision, the drug's property, and the patient's health status.

<3>
In the third example, the model has misconstrued the causal relationship by singling out the black wire touching the battery as the sole cause without considering the role of the red wire. Although the black wire was designated to touch the battery and was in the right position, the machine would not have short-circuited if the red wire had not also touched the battery. This suggests that both wires touching the battery simultaneously are integral to causing the short circuit, not just one over the other.

Based on these examples, the model seems to struggle with scenarios that involve both action and inaction, overlook the role of decisions in causation, and have difficulty interpreting scenarios that involve multiple simultaneous causes. Here are proposed improvements:

1. Elaborate on the concept of inaction being a potential cause.
2. Differentiate more clearly between correlative and causative factors.
3. Emphasize on the principle that decisions can generate causal circumstances.
4. Provide more context on how to deal with multiple causes.
5. Include more examples of causation analysis in the prompt to guide responses.
6. Expand on the concept of the intersecting influences of objects/people, actions, and decisions.
7. Stress on the importance of considering all variables in a given situation before attributing a cause.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Carefully analyze various scenarios to assign accurate causal attribution. Factor in all relevant elements, be they incidents or entities, appreciating that causation can be a result of several actions transpiring at once. Recognize that changes in factors don't always lead to causation. Be diligent when sifting through whether results were pre-determined or remained immune to particular changes. Pay heightened attention to atypical events and outliers that break from convention, assessing these cases singularly and not categorically viewing them as interdependent. Understand the broader context, without jumping to conclusions based solely on individual occurrences. Remember that it's crucial to differentiate correlation from causation to not hastily infer a causal relationship just because two events happened concomitantly. Deal with the intricacy of assigning causation when confronted with multiple, concurrent causes. Understand that inaction may also lead to causation and cannot be dismissed in the analysis. Also, understand the role decisions play in setting up causal circumstances. Be keen to examine scenarios involving numerous simultaneous causes. Strive to distinguish causation from intention, allocating intention based on explicit and implicit goals of the individuals involved, rather than solely on their actions' outcomes. Use your comprehension of these principles to precisely respond to the questions on causal attribution that follow. Keep in mind that causation involves understanding the intersecting influences of objects/people, actions, or lack thereof, and decisions. Every variable in a situation must be considered before making a causal claim. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. The causal attribution can be directly linked to David's action of changing the temperature setting, as it was a necessary condition for the clothes to dry in the specified time frame. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Incorrect Example Analysis:

The question given is a test of the comprehension of sufficiency and necessity in the context of causation. The dryer will dry the clothes in 60 minutes with either the cycle set to MAX DRY, which is the case, or the temperature set to HIGH. David does change the temperature setting to HIGH, but this was not the reason the clothes dried in 60 minutes. The causal event here was the machine already being set to MAX DRY which is enough to dry the clothes in 60 minutes without requiring the temperature to be HIGH.

The prompt unfortunately did not clearly explain the concept of 'necessary and sufficient conditions' for causation, and so the AI answered incorrectly under the false assumption that altering the temperature to HIGH was a necessary condition for drying in 60 minutes. Without understanding the difference between necessary and sufficient, the AI focused instead on the change implemented by David (setting the temperature on HIGH) and it falsely attributed causation.

2. Improvement Aspects:

- Specify in the prompt that the AI needs to distinguish between necessary and sufficient conditions for causation and not just focus on the order of sequential events.
- Include a requirement for the AI to determine which action or condition is either 'necessary' for an outcome, 'sufficient' for an outcome, or both. In this case, being set to MAX DRY was a sufficient condition to dry the clothes in 60 minutes.
- Reinforce the distinguishing between correlation and causation. The AI should understand that just because a change occurred and was followed by an outcome, it doesn't immediately link the two as cause-and-effect if the outcome could have been produced under other conditions.
- Add instructions to analyze the pre-conditions before a change like "scrutinizing the initial conditions before any changes have been implemented".
- It must be clearly stated, that not every change leads to causation and there could be pre-existing conditions or actions that could contribute to the outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. The causal attribution can be directly linked to David's action of changing the temperature setting, as the condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes was met by this specific change. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The question asked if Jim turning on his lamp caused the circuit breaker to fail. The prompt encouraged the model to deeply analyze various factors, such as multiple simultaneous actions, correlational and causational relationships, and to avoid assumptions. However, the model misinterpreted the scenario by stating that Jim turning on his lamp did not directly cause the failure, indicating a need for clearer instruction about the notion of contributing causes for an event. In this case, Jim's action to turn on his lamp was indeed a contributing cause.

<2>
The question asked whether Wayne not changing the position of the device contributed to it being fully charged. The model mistakenly perceived Wayne's inaction as a non-causal action, while it was indeed a cause because had he moved the device from the pad, it would not have charged. The incorrect answer appears to stem from the model's confusion regarding the causality of inactions or maintained actions. 

<3>
This question asked whether David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The model incorrectly affirmed so without recognizing that the dryer would also dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if the cycle was set to MAX DRY, which it was. A potential source of error may be the model's difficulty in identifying and separating the impact of multiple potential causes.

By examining these examples, it's clear that the prompt needs improvements in several areas:

1. Detailing the understanding of contributing causes: The prompt should specify that a contributing action, even if it's not the sole action or is accompanied by other actions, can be a cause.

2. Explication about the causality of inactions: The prompt should make it clear that inactions or maintained actions (like not moving something) could also be causal in nature.

3. Guidance on assessing complex scenarios: Lastly, the prompt should offer more explicit guidance on dealing with scenarios where multiple potential causes exist to avoid overlooking or misattributing causation. 

By addressing these areas, the prompt can guide the model to make correct attributions of causation, even in complex or nuanced scenarios.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly cause the circuit breaker to fail. The causal factor leading to the circuit breaker failure was the simultaneous action of three people turning on their lamps at the same time. Jim's action of turning on his lamp was just one of the contributing factors, along with Carol and Bob turning on their lamps. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for it to fully charge in one hour. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged. Therefore, the correct answer is:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because the temperature setting was changed to HIGH. The causal attribution can be directly linked to David's action of changing the temperature setting, as the condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes was met by this specific change. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
The question asked if Jim turning on his lamp caused the circuit breaker to fail. The prompt encouraged the model to deeply analyze various factors, such as multiple simultaneous actions, correlational and causational relationships, and to avoid assumptions. However, the model misinterpreted the scenario by stating that Jim turning on his lamp did not directly cause the failure, indicating a need for clearer instruction about the notion of contributing causes for an event. In this case, Jim's action to turn on his lamp was indeed a contributing cause.

<2>
The question asked whether Wayne not changing the position of the device contributed to it being fully charged. The model mistakenly perceived Wayne's inaction as a non-causal action, while it was indeed a cause because had he moved the device from the pad, it would not have charged. The incorrect answer appears to stem from the model's confusion regarding the causality of inactions or maintained actions. 

<3>
This question asked whether David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The model incorrectly affirmed so without recognizing that the dryer would also dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if the cycle was set to MAX DRY, which it was. A potential source of error may be the model's difficulty in identifying and separating the impact of multiple potential causes.

By examining these examples, it's clear that the prompt needs improvements in several areas:

1. Detailing the understanding of contributing causes: The prompt should specify that a contributing action, even if it's not the sole action or is accompanied by other actions, can be a cause.

2. Explication about the causality of inactions: The prompt should make it clear that inactions or maintained actions (like not moving something) could also be causal in nature.

3. Guidance on assessing complex scenarios: Lastly, the prompt should offer more explicit guidance on dealing with scenarios where multiple potential causes exist to avoid overlooking or misattributing causation. 

By addressing these areas, the prompt can guide the model to make correct attributions of causation, even in complex or nuanced scenarios.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze situations to accurately assign causal attribution by considering each individual factor and event, keeping in mind that causation can be a result of simultaneous actions, and that any change in factors does not necessarily infer causation. Evaluate whether outcomes were pre-determined or not affected by given changes. Pay careful attention to aberrant events and events that differ from routine, and evaluate circumstances independently, not always considering them dependent on each other. Understand the full context of the situation and avoid assumptions based solely on individual events. Use this understanding to answer the following questions about causal attribution.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model misunderstood the conditions of the causation. The bet was for making either a layup or a 3-point shot, so making either shots would have won Louie the bet. The prompt didn't sufficiently emphasize the individual contribution of each of these different criteria (a layup or a 3-point shot) towards winning the bet. As a result, the model ascribed the win to the second event (the 3-point shot), neglecting how the layup also fulfilled the winning condition.

<2> 
The issue here is similar to the first example. The model again failed to recognize that both the dice roll and the spinner result individually met the condition for winning. It incorrectly concluded that the spinner landing on green did not contribute to the win, disregarding the "OR" condition which establishes that either event could lead to a win.

<3>
This example brings out another misconception by the model. It failed to accurately identify the immediate cause (Jane logging on the computer) despite it being against the company policy. The prompt didn't emphasize enough the need to identify individual actions, especially if they violate established rules or policies, as a main cause of resulting events.

Based on these observations, here are suggestions to improve the prompt:

1. Place greater emphasis on identifying individual causes that could independently result in an event, particularly when information includes wordings such as "either...or".
2. Clarify that whenever rules or policies are violated, the actions causing that violation are likely to be the immediate causes of any effects that follow.
3. Reiterate the importance of not neglecting the early events as potential causes just because a later event also fulfills a condition.
4. Make the instruction more explicit about the need to consider simultaneous occurrences as separate potential causes. In situations where two actions both could result in the same effect, each should be considered independently.
5. Ask the model to consider the real world logic or common sense when answering the question.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision did not cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug that was administered, which was based on the intern's decision to use it and the pharmacist's approval. The attending doctor's decision to sign off, despite the hospital policy, did not directly lead to the patient's recovery.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The question in this example asked whether the attending doctor's decision caused the patient's recovery. The AI model interpreted this carefully but possibly focused too heavily on the definition of direct causality and the hospital's policy. The AI model's response indicated that it presumed that the decision causing the patient's recovery should have to be directly related to the cure of the disease such as being the one who suggested the drug, rather than being one of the necessary procedures to administer this drug. The prompt should be more clear that a causal event can also be any step within a chain of events necessary leading to a result.

Example 2:
The question in this example asked whether Bob the henchman intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. The model perhaps wrongly interpreted this, focusing on the outcome of the actions rather than the intention behind them. Bob's intent was to maximize his monetary gain, not to cause harm to the health of the townspeople, which was an unintended, albeit known, consequence. While Bob was aware that the townspeople would be harmed, he was indifferent about it, evidenced by his statement: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople." The current prompt might have made the AI model focus too heavily on the end result rather than the intention behind the event.

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

1) Define "causality" more clearly: The prompt could include clearer definitions of causality and how it can operate within a chain of events. This could help the AI model understand that causality doesn't necessarily mean being directly responsible for an event.

2) Specify intention in causality: Where applicable, the prompt could remind the AI that intentionality is a significant part of causal events, especially in examples related to personal decisions or actions. 

3) Emphasize policy understanding: The prompt should stress that understanding a policy does not mean it's always followed, and breaking rules or policies should not decrease the chance of causality, as shown in the first example.

4) Focus on direct and indirect effects: The AI model should consider not just the primary objective or the direct consequence of an action but also its indirect effects since both are the results of the action.  

5) Clarify the evaluation of "causal attribution": The prompt can emphasize on avoiding assumptions about causal attribution when there's a lack of evidence or clear linkage provided in the text. This might help the AI model not to jump to a conclusion based on the outcome of an event.  

6) Ask for AI to weigh all the factors: The prompt should indicate that the AI model needs to weigh all the factors involved to identify the answer correctly, avoiding overemphasizing any single aspect.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example <1>:

The model chose (B) No, upon the question if Jane's actions caused the computer to crash. The model could have interpreted the prompt's instruction not to "presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established" and applied this to Jane's actions. While it's clear to us that Jane's simultaneous login with Lauren caused the crash, based on the information, the AI might have decided a direct, explicit link wasn't established. This could be improved by reminding the AI that policies violations can lead to causal events.

For example <2>:

The model chose (B) No to the question asking if the watch was fully charged because Wayne did not change the location of the device. The model might have misunderstood the causal logic - that Wayne's inaction (not moving the watch) was part of maintaining the conditions for the gadget to charge. We could include emphasis on understanding actions and inactions as contributing factors in causality.

Improvements:
 
1. Remind the AI that violation of rules or policies can lead to causal events.
2. Emphasize understanding both actions and inactions as factors in causation.
3. Instruct the model to consider all simultaneous actions contributing to the event while interpreting the information, even if the impact of a single action might not explicitly mentioned.
4. Ask it to evaluate all potential options before submitting an answer – ensuring the model doesn't jump to conclusions too soon.

Improved prompt:

Interpret the provided information about causal events carefully. Note the order of events, any rules or policies that are violated, and understand the collective impact of multiple simultaneous actions - both actions and inactions can contribute to causality. Also, correctly interpret logical operators for an accurate understanding of causality. Do not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not clearly established. Evaluate all potential options before providing the selected answer choice.

4. Ask it to evaluate all potential options before submitting an answer – ensuring the model doesn't jump to conclusions too soon.

Improved prompt:

Interpret the provided information about causal events carefully. Note the order of events, any rules or policies that are violated, and understand the collective impact of multiple simultaneous actions - both actions and inactions can contribute to causality. Also, correctly interpret logical operators for an accurate understanding of causality. Do not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not clearly established. Evaluate all potential options before providing the selected answer choice.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

gradient:
For the first example, where the model incorrectly predicted "A" instead of "B", the question pertains to whether Bob, the henchman, intentionally caused harm to the townspeople's health. Despite clear evidence that his actions had a direct and harmful impact on the townspeople's health, the critical piece of information here is Bob's stated intention: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can." This statement suggests that although he was aware of the potential harm his actions could cause, his primary motive was acquiring money, not harming the townspeople. This nuanced difference between the consequences of an action and the original intent behind it seems to have been misinterpreted by the model trained on the given prompt.

For the second example, where the model incorrectly predicted "B" instead of "A", the model failed to properly interpret the intention behind the man's action. The hunter knew the possibility of his shot hitting the bird-watcher but disregarded it because he was focused on his main goal, to win the competition. In this context, the hunter's conscious decision to take the shot despite knowing the potential risk to the bird-watcher's life would generally be attributed to intentional harm. However, the prompt's guidance to “not assume causality where none is explicitly established” might have led the model to overlook this aspect.

The prompt could benefit from improvements in the following aspects:
1. Intent Recognition: The prompt should guide the model to focus more on deciphering the individual's stated intentions rather than going only by the plain consequences of their actions.
2. Causality Interpretation: The prompt needs to emphasize that causality doesn’t always need explicit establishment and can be inferred from context, especially in scenarios where the potential negative effects of certain actions are knowingly disregarded. 
3. Ambiguity Handling: The prompt should help the model better handle scenarios featuring ambiguous ethical choices and double-effects (i.e., where an action has both intended and unintended effects.)
4. Subjective Judgement Recognition: The prompt should stress that decision-making regarding subjective judgments is often complex and may lean heavily on nuanced information, inferred intention, and ethical considerations.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH.

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

<1> 
Question Analysis: The question is about whether David changing the temperature setting to HIGH led to his clothes drying in sixty minutes. The conditions noted are that the clothes will dry in sixty minutes if EITHER the cycle is set to MAX DRY OR the temperature is set to HIGH. The cycle was already set to MAX DRY, thus even if the temperature wasn't set to HIGH, the clothes would still dry in sixty minutes. 

Wrong Answer Analysis: The model incorrectly predicts "Yes" (A). This might be due to confusion caused by the detailed sequence of events and the logical operator in the question. The model may have mistaken the temperature change as the direct causal factor for the clothes drying, without fully grasing the logical operator "either...or". 

<2> 
Question Analysis: The question asks about a violation of a company's official policy, where the consequence of two people logging onto the central computer at the same time leads to an empty email being sent. The violation occurred when Zoe logged in at 9 am, outside of her designated afternoon slot.

Wrong Answer Analysis: The model incorrectly assigns causality to Alice. This suggests that the model might have failed to understand that Zoe's violation of protocol was the primary cause of the empty email being sent. Despite Alice logging in at her appropriate time, the model perhaps erroneously assumes that the fact Alice logged in while Zoe was still connected implies causality, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the sequence of events and attribution of causality when policies are breached.

Improvements for Prompt:
Based on the errors found in these answers, the following aspects can be improved:

1. Make the instructions more precise: Current instructions about handling “either...or” scenarios and not inferring causality where not explicitly established need to be more explicit. The improved instruction can explicitly mention that the model should not attribute causality to an event if the outcome can be achieved independently of that event.

2. Focus on breach of rules: Reinforce the importance of identifying and understanding the consequences of breaches in rules or policies. The model needs to place greater emphasis on violated protocol in determining causality. The model should consider the temporal sequence of events and acknowlege causality in cases where a rule was broken first, then an event happened.

3. Conclusion Elements: Include instructions on how to conclude responses. The model must understand the overall situation, not just the question at the end. The improved instruction can ask the model to consider summarizing the entire situation before answering the particular questions.

4. Handling of logical operators: Explicitly mention that the model should pay attention to logical operators and properly differentiate between them when assessing the logic of the statements and determining causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, Alice caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question Analysis: The question is about whether David changing the temperature setting to HIGH led to his clothes drying in sixty minutes. The conditions noted are that the clothes will dry in sixty minutes if EITHER the cycle is set to MAX DRY OR the temperature is set to HIGH. The cycle was already set to MAX DRY, thus even if the temperature wasn't set to HIGH, the clothes would still dry in sixty minutes. 

Wrong Answer Analysis: The model incorrectly predicts "Yes" (A). This might be due to confusion caused by the detailed sequence of events and the logical operator in the question. The model may have mistaken the temperature change as the direct causal factor for the clothes drying, without fully grasing the logical operator "either...or". 

<2> 
Question Analysis: The question asks about a violation of a company's official policy, where the consequence of two people logging onto the central computer at the same time leads to an empty email being sent. The violation occurred when Zoe logged in at 9 am, outside of her designated afternoon slot.

Wrong Answer Analysis: The model incorrectly assigns causality to Alice. This suggests that the model might have failed to understand that Zoe's violation of protocol was the primary cause of the empty email being sent. Despite Alice logging in at her appropriate time, the model perhaps erroneously assumes that the fact Alice logged in while Zoe was still connected implies causality, possibly due to a misunderstanding of the sequence of events and attribution of causality when policies are breached.

Improvements for Prompt:
Based on the errors found in these answers, the following aspects can be improved:

1. Make the instructions more precise: Current instructions about handling “either...or” scenarios and not inferring causality where not explicitly established need to be more explicit. The improved instruction can explicitly mention that the model should not attribute causality to an event if the outcome can be achieved independently of that event.

2. Focus on breach of rules: Reinforce the importance of identifying and understanding the consequences of breaches in rules or policies. The model needs to place greater emphasis on violated protocol in determining causality. The model should consider the temporal sequence of events and acknowlege causality in cases where a rule was broken first, then an event happened.

3. Conclusion Elements: Include instructions on how to conclude responses. The model must understand the overall situation, not just the question at the end. The improved instruction can ask the model to consider summarizing the entire situation before answering the particular questions.

4. Handling of logical operators: Explicitly mention that the model should pay attention to logical operators and properly differentiate between them when assessing the logic of the statements and determining causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jane did not cause the computer to crash. The official policy of having only one person use the computer at a time was put in place to prevent crashes, and Jane's decision to disobey the policy by logging on at the same time as Lauren led to the crash. Therefore, the policy violation was the cause of the computer crash, not Jane's specific action.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In analyzing this question, the model seems to have incorrectly interpreted the cause-effect relationship involved in the situation. The model attributes the cause of the computer crash to the violated policy rather than directly to Jane's actions. However, it's Jane's action of logging in during the time that Lauren was permitted to use the computer, thus directly violating the policy, that caused the computer to crash.

Contributing factors to this incorrect response could be:
1. Miscommunication in the guidelines about prioritizing the sequence of events over the direct actions of individuals.
2. Putting too much emphasis on breached policies or rules as causative elements without considering that violations of these rules through specific actions can be the direct causes.
3. Misinterpretation of 'independent effects of multiple concurrent actions'. While Jane and Lauren are both logged into the computer concurrently, the model doesn't seem to interpret that Jane's logging in at the same time can cause the outcome independently.

Wrong Example 2:
For this incorrect response, the model wrongly attributed the cause of the empty email to Alice's action of logging in while Zoe was already online. The model seems to be applying a "last action" reasoning, mistaking Alice as the cause due to her being the last one to log in, instead of considering Zoe's policy violation the cause of the event.

Contributing factors to this incorrect result seem to be:
1. An overemphasis on the sequence of events, attributing causality to the last action that took place before the undesired outcome.
2. A disregard of 'either...or' scenarios where the policy violation by either employee alone could result in the empty email being sent.
3. A lack of clarity on the impact of policy violations as potential causative elements, thus overlooking Zoe's earlier policy violation.

Improvements to Prompt: 
Based on the above analysis, the following are recommendations to improve the prompt:
1. Clarify that the sequence of events should not outweigh the direct actions of individuals when determining causality.
2. Emphasize that the violating actions resulting from a breached policy are the causative elements, not the policy itself.
3. Better illustrate 'either...or' scenarios and instruct the model to acknowledge that a violation of rules or guidelines by any participant can independently lead to undesired outcomes.
4. Importantly, stress the importance of applying real-world logic to the analysis and interpretation of information. Let the model know that the last event prior to an outcome is not always the cause, especially in the presence of policy violations.
5. Encourage the model to consider each participant's actions independently in multi-actor scenarios.

cur_prompt: Having carefully digested the provided information, your task is to deliver intricate interpretations of possible causalities and events, while also giving due attention to the chronological order of these events and understanding any broken rules or policies. Grasp the distinct outcomes of several simultaneous actions rather than viewing them as a whole. Be proficient in interpreting logical operators like 'either...or' that signal any single action can independently lead to a result. Avoid making automatic assumptions of causality where none is explicitly indicated but at the same time, be open to considering early events and policy breaches as potential causal factors. In circumstances where the potential negative effects of action are knowingly disregarded, recognize this as an implied understanding of causality. Pay particular attention to understanding the true intention behind each action, when handling ethical ambiguities and when faced with scenarios involving multiple effects - intended and unintended. Use sound human judgment to differentiate between the intended action and implicit collateral damage. Use this nuanced understanding of intentions and effects to analyze causal attribution. Always remember that causality isn’t always explicitly established, and in such cases, rely on context, inferred intentions, and potential outcomes to make a reasoned judgement. Finally, answer the questions on causal attribution accurately using the provided options. Through this layered understanding, aim to mirror the nuanced decision-making of a human observer when answering.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting. 
<answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons for Incorrect Answers:

1. The model's response reflects a misunderstanding of the logical operator ‘either...or’ that had been outlined in the prompt as an area of key competence. The "either...or" operator indicates that only one of the two conditions (Max Dry setting or High temperature) is needed for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. According to the information provided, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, which independently would have triggered the clothes drying in sixty minutes. Therefore, David's intervention - changing the temperature - made no difference to the output.

2. The model failed to differentiate between simultaneous actions and individual actions that independently lead to a result, despite this being emphasized in the prompt. The action of setting the temperature to HIGH did not cause the clothes to dry, as they would have dried at the MAX DRY setting without the temperature adjustment. Not making this distinction led to the wrong causal attribution.

3. The model also did not pay enough heed to the chronological order of events, as indicated in the prompt, which would have allowed for an understanding that David's clothes were set to dry in 60 minutes prior to him setting the temperature to HIGH. 

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Better emphasize the understanding and interpretation of logical operators. Expound on their importance to independent actions and their possible results. 

2. Strengthen the instruction about paying due attention to the chronological order of events.

3. Highlight the need to separate simultaneous actions from the actual cause-effect relationships to better attribute causality.

4. Request the model to check facts before making any causal attributions or assumptions. For instance, in this case, the model should acknowledge that the clothes would have dried regardless of David changing the setting.

5. Encourage deeper analysis of the provided conditions and outcomes to avoid assigning unnecessary causality.

6. It might be helpful to include explicit instructions to the model to not infer causality where none is explicitly indicated or necessary. In this case, the task of setting the temperature to HIGH did not cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. 

7. Stress on examining each action independently before attributing it to an outcome. The model should be able to differentiate actions that individually or collectively contribute to an outcome versus those that do not.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Given the detailed information, your job is to precisely analyze and decipher possible causal relations and unfolding events, paying special attention to their chronological sequences and any violated rules or policies. Identify the separate outcomes of multiple concurrent actions, rather than perceiving them collectively. Be adept at interpreting logical connectors like 'either...or' and understand that each action within such a structure can independently lead to a result. Refrain from assuming causality without explicit indications but be willing to examine previous events and policy violations as potential causative elements. When potential harmful effects are knowingly ignored, identify this as a tacit acknowledgment of causality. Strive to understand the true intentions behind each action, especially when faced with ethical dilemmas or scenarios with multiple plausible effects - both intended and unintended. Use prudent human judgment to separate intentional actions from unintentional repercussions. This nuanced comprehension of intentions and effects will prove beneficial when attributing causality. Recognize that causality isn't invariably explicit and in such scenarios, rely on contextual cues, inferred intentions, and likely consequences for a reasoned judgment. Encourage critical thinking, and refrain from attributing unnecessary causality, particularly when all conditions necessary for an event to occur were already met before an action. Do not infer causality where none is explicitly required or indicated, as in 'either...or' situations. Analyze and scrutinize prior conditions and actions independently before hastily attributing them to an outcome. Lastly, pick an answer from the options provided to respond to questions on causal attribution accurately. Emulate the intricate decision-making process of a human observer through this comprehensive understanding. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The causal factor was the simultaneous action of three people turning on their lamps at the same time, which was explicitly stated to be the cause of the breaker failing. Jim's individual action alone did not lead to the failure of the circuit breaker.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not solely because Wayne did not change the position of the device. <answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Model response: No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail.
Correct answer: Yes

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The prompt asked the model to differentiate between multiple actions and their varied outcomes and avoid automatic assumptions of causality where none is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the model arrived at the conclusion that it was the collective action of three people using their lamps simultaneously that led to the failure of the breaker, not just Jim's individual action.
2. However, the model failed to recognize the policy breach made by Jim (he is not allowed to use his lamp on Thursdays) and therefore disregarded Jim's action as a potential causative factor.
3. Despite the information that fewer than three lamps wouldn't cause the breaker to fail, the model persuasion leaned toward a collective action rather than individual responsibility.

Wrong Example 2:
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Model response: No, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not solely because Wayne did not change the position of the device.
Correct answer: Yes

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The prompt may have led the model towards viewing the watch being plugged in and being on the charging pad as individual actions leading to a result. But, the model failed to credit the unaltered position of the device as a contributing factor to its charging, which was the precise question asked.
2. The model took a literal view of what factually caused the charging — the plug and the charging pad, and ignored the nuanced causality of Wayne leaving the device untouched.

Improvements:
1. Make more explicit the need for the model to consider policy breaches as potential causes in causality questions.
2. The distinction between individual actions and group actions causing an event needs to be more defined.
3. Instead of avoiding making assumptions of causality where not explicitly indicated, the prompt should encourage the model to carefully consider possible implicit causalities based on cues in the event narrative.
4. The importance of context and the phrasing of questions in determining causal attributions should be better emphasized.
5. The model should be guided to consider the non-alteration of a state (such as not changing the device's position) as a potential cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The causal factor was the simultaneous action of three people turning on their lamps at the same time, which was explicitly stated to be the cause of the breaker failing. Jim's individual action alone did not lead to the failure of the circuit breaker.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not solely because Wayne did not change the position of the device. <answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Model response: No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail.
Correct answer: Yes

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The prompt asked the model to differentiate between multiple actions and their varied outcomes and avoid automatic assumptions of causality where none is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the model arrived at the conclusion that it was the collective action of three people using their lamps simultaneously that led to the failure of the breaker, not just Jim's individual action.
2. However, the model failed to recognize the policy breach made by Jim (he is not allowed to use his lamp on Thursdays) and therefore disregarded Jim's action as a potential causative factor.
3. Despite the information that fewer than three lamps wouldn't cause the breaker to fail, the model persuasion leaned toward a collective action rather than individual responsibility.

Wrong Example 2:
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Model response: No, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not solely because Wayne did not change the position of the device.
Correct answer: Yes

Step by Step Analysis:
1. The prompt may have led the model towards viewing the watch being plugged in and being on the charging pad as individual actions leading to a result. But, the model failed to credit the unaltered position of the device as a contributing factor to its charging, which was the precise question asked.
2. The model took a literal view of what factually caused the charging — the plug and the charging pad, and ignored the nuanced causality of Wayne leaving the device untouched.

Improvements:
1. Make more explicit the need for the model to consider policy breaches as potential causes in causality questions.
2. The distinction between individual actions and group actions causing an event needs to be more defined.
3. Instead of avoiding making assumptions of causality where not explicitly indicated, the prompt should encourage the model to carefully consider possible implicit causalities based on cues in the event narrative.
4. The importance of context and the phrasing of questions in determining causal attributions should be better emphasized.
5. The model should be guided to consider the non-alteration of a state (such as not changing the device's position) as a potential cause.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Reasoning:

The prompt goes wrong due to the inaccurate interpretation of the causal attribution and logical operators. In the first example, the model could not carefully parse the logical operator 'either...or'. In the original statement, the clothes could dry when either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH; it is not necessary to have both conditions met. When David changed the temperature, it did not directly lead to his clothes drying, because the condition of having the cycle set to MAX DRY had already been met. Therefore, the causality in this situation is misinterpreted by the model, which overlooks the detail of the 'either...or' operation and the original state of the dryer (cycle is already set to MAX DRY).

<2> Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the second example, the model failed to differentiate between indirect causality and expressed intention. Despite the model being instructed to "understand the true intention behind each action," it seemed to have applied the harmful outcome of the actions as a reference for the intention of the character Bob. Bob's intention was to rob the bank and acquire as much money as possible. The harm to the townspeople is an unintended side effect, not a directly intended action. Bob's indifference towards the potential harm does not translate into intentional harm.

Prompt Improvement Proposal:

1. The prompt needs to more explicitly instruct the model to analyze the logical operators in the information and clarify their role in determining causality. An added emphasis on correctly interpreting these operators could help the model.
2. Emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect causality. The model should understand that not every subsequent event is the result of an intentional cause. 
3. Include instructions to the model to differentiate more clearly between intended effects and unintentional side effects or indirect outcomes.
4. Clarify the analysis of intentions. While negative indirect consequences may be imputed to a primary actor, they do not automatically imply malicious intent if it has not been explicitly expressed.
5. Incorporate more clear instructions on the consideration of original conditions or states in the analysis of causal attributions. This can help in scenarios involving existing conditions that independently lead to the outcome.
6. The model should be instructed to not just rely on the final outcome but examine the possible individual outcomes of multiple simultaneous actions.

Prompt Improvement Proposal:

1. The prompt needs to more explicitly instruct the model to analyze the logical operators in the information and clarify their role in determining causality. An added emphasis on correctly interpreting these operators could help the model.
2. Emphasize the distinction between direct and indirect causality. The model should understand that not every subsequent event is the result of an intentional cause. 
3. Include instructions to the model to differentiate more clearly between intended effects and unintentional side effects or indirect outcomes.
4. Clarify the analysis of intentions. While negative indirect consequences may be imputed to a primary actor, they do not automatically imply malicious intent if it has not been explicitly expressed.
5. Incorporate more clear instructions on the consideration of original conditions or states in the analysis of causal attributions. This can help in scenarios involving existing conditions that independently lead to the outcome.
6. The model should be instructed to not just rely on the final outcome but examine the possible individual outcomes of multiple simultaneous actions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Having carefully digested the provided information, your task is to deliver intricate interpretations of possible causalities and events, while also giving due attention to the chronological order of these events and understanding any broken rules or policies. Grasp the distinct outcomes of several simultaneous actions rather than viewing them as a whole. Be proficient in interpreting logical operators like 'either...or' that signal any single action can independently lead to a result. Avoid making automatic assumptions of causality where none is explicitly indicated but at the same time, be open to considering early events and policy breaches as potential causal factors. In circumstances where the potential negative effects of action are knowingly disregarded, recognize this as an implied understanding of causality. Pay particular attention to understanding the true intention behind each action, when handling ethical ambiguities and when faced with scenarios involving multiple effects - intended and unintended. Use sound human judgment to differentiate between the intended action and implicit collateral damage. Use this nuanced understanding of intentions and effects to analyze causal attribution. Always remember that causality isn’t always explicitly established, and in such cases, rely on context, inferred intentions, and potential outcomes to make a reasoned judgement. Finally, answer the questions on causal attribution accurately using the provided options. Through this layered understanding, aim to mirror the nuanced decision-making of a human observer when answering.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?

(A) Yes
(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit, as per the setup where both wires touching the battery simultaneously leads to a short circuit. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In the first example, the language model does not respond correctly due to a flaw in causal attribution. The prompt clarifies that the model needs to understand the separate outcomes of multiple actions. However, in this case, the model scrutinizes the event as a collective action (both Lauren and Jane logging in simultaneously) instead of isolating the single act of Jane logging in against policy. The misinterpretation of attributing causality collectively resulted in the wrong answer.

Example 2:
Contrary to the first example, the model fails this case due to an overemphasis on independent action. Although the prompt instructs the model to decipher actions within an 'either...or' structure independently, it somehow fails to recognize the direct cause-and-effect relationship of the attending doctor's signature leading to the administration of the drug. Instead, it maintains an unnecessary level of separation between the concurrent actions, ignoring the direct violation of policy by the doctor, which ultimately leads to the patient’s recovery.

Example 3:
The model incorrectly answers the third example because it misinterprets the scenario as an 'either...or' situation rather than a collective action scenario. The language within the prompt that recalls attention to logical connectors like 'either...or' might have led the model to recognize the condition of the black wire touching the battery as sufficient to cause a short circuit, ignoring the critical caveat that the machine will short circuit only if both wires touch the battery simultaneously.

Improvements:
1. Balance the emphasis on individual and collective actions: The language in the prompt disproportionately focuses on individual actions, leading to misinterpretation in some situations. An updated prompt should better clarify that both collective and individual actions need to be considered when assigning causality.

2. Improve policy violation handling: The language in the prompt surrounding policy or rule violations should be emphasized more. The model should interpret these violations as a critical aspect when deciphering causative elements.

3. Simplify and clarify language: The prompt's language can be quite complex and might lead to confusion on how to interpret 'either...or' cues. Clarifying these phrases might prevent the model from misconstruing these cues as one-way causations.

4. Strengthen chronological understanding: Improve the model's understanding of chronological sequences and the role they play in attributing causality, especially when multiple factors and actions are present.

5. Emphasize direct cause-effect relations: If a single direct cause-effect relation can be identified, revise the instructions to instruct the model to prioritize this over analyzing cumulative effects.

Although the prompt instructs the model to decipher actions within an 'either...or' structure independently, it somehow fails to recognize the direct cause-and-effect relationship of the attending doctor's signature leading to the administration of the drug. Instead, it maintains an unnecessary level of separation between the concurrent actions, ignoring the direct violation of policy by the doctor, which ultimately leads to the patient’s recovery.

Example 3:
The model incorrectly answers the third example because it misinterprets the scenario as an 'either...or' situation rather than a collective action scenario. The language within the prompt that recalls attention to logical connectors like 'either...or' might have led the model to recognize the condition of the black wire touching the battery as sufficient to cause a short circuit, ignoring the critical caveat that the machine will short circuit only if both wires touch the battery simultaneously.

Improvements:
1. Balance the emphasis on individual and collective actions: The language in the prompt disproportionately focuses on individual actions, leading to misinterpretation in some situations. An updated prompt should better clarify that both collective and individual actions need to be considered when assigning causality.

2. Improve policy violation handling: The language in the prompt surrounding policy or rule violations should be emphasized more. The model should interpret these violations as a critical aspect when deciphering causative elements.

3. Simplify and clarify language: The prompt's language can be quite complex and might lead to confusion on how to interpret 'either...or' cues. Clarifying these phrases might prevent the model from misconstruing these cues as one-way causations.

4. Strengthen chronological understanding: Improve the model's understanding of chronological sequences and the role they play in attributing causality, especially when multiple factors and actions are present.

5. Emphasize direct cause-effect relations: If a single direct cause-effect relation can be identified, revise the instructions to instruct the model to prioritize this over analyzing cumulative effects.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Having carefully digested the provided information, your task is to deliver intricate interpretations of possible causalities and events, while also giving due attention to the chronological order of these events and understanding any broken rules or policies. Grasp the distinct outcomes of several simultaneous actions rather than viewing them as a whole. Be proficient in interpreting logical operators like 'either...or' that signal any single action can independently lead to a result. Avoid making automatic assumptions of causality where none is explicitly indicated but at the same time, be open to considering early events and policy breaches as potential causal factors. In circumstances where the potential negative effects of action are knowingly disregarded, recognize this as an implied understanding of causality. Pay particular attention to understanding the true intention behind each action, when handling ethical ambiguities and when faced with scenarios involving multiple effects - intended and unintended. Use sound human judgment to differentiate between the intended action and implicit collateral damage. Use this nuanced understanding of intentions and effects to analyze causal attribution. Always remember that causality isn’t always explicitly established, and in such cases, rely on context, inferred intentions, and potential outcomes to make a reasoned judgement. Finally, answer the questions on causal attribution accurately using the provided options. Through this layered understanding, aim to mirror the nuanced decision-making of a human observer when answering.
(4) Given the detailed information, your job is to precisely analyze and decipher possible causal relations and unfolding events, paying special attention to their chronological sequences and any violated rules or policies. Identify the separate outcomes of multiple concurrent actions, rather than perceiving them collectively. Be adept at interpreting logical connectors like 'either...or' and understand that each action within such a structure can independently lead to a result. Refrain from assuming causality without explicit indications but be willing to examine previous events and policy violations as potential causative elements. When potential harmful effects are knowingly ignored, identify this as a tacit acknowledgment of causality. Strive to understand the true intentions behind each action, especially when faced with ethical dilemmas or scenarios with multiple plausible effects - both intended and unintended. Use prudent human judgment to separate intentional actions from unintentional repercussions. This nuanced comprehension of intentions and effects will prove beneficial when attributing causality. Recognize that causality isn't invariably explicit and in such scenarios, rely on contextual cues, inferred intentions, and likely consequences for a reasoned judgment. Encourage critical thinking, and refrain from attributing unnecessary causality, particularly when all conditions necessary for an event to occur were already met before an action. Do not infer causality where none is explicitly required or indicated, as in 'either...or' situations. Analyze and scrutinize prior conditions and actions independently before hastily attributing them to an outcome. Lastly, pick an answer from the options provided to respond to questions on causal attribution accurately. Emulate the intricate decision-making process of a human observer through this comprehensive understanding.

Avoid jumping to conclusions about causality in the absence of explicit evidence but remain open to considering past events and policy infringements as potential causative elements. When harmful effects are knowingly overlooked, interpret this as implicit causality. Endeavor to understand the core intentions behind each action, specifically in case of ethical quandaries or situations with multiple potential effects - intentional or otherwise. Employ sound human judgment to discern deliberate actions from unintended consequences. This nuanced understanding helps in accurate causality attribution. However, remember that causality may not always be explicitly evident. In such situations, rely on contextual clues, inferred purpose, and plausible effects for a reasoned analysis. Exercise critical thinking and avoid attributing unnecessary causality, especially when all necessary prerequisites for an event were fulfilled prior to a particular action.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The cause of the circuit breaker failing was the simultaneous actions of Carol, Bob, and Nancy turning on their lamps at the same time, which violated the rule that only two people can turn on their lamps simultaneously without causing the breaker to fail. Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly lead to the circuit breaker failing.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

Step 1: 
The model misunderstood the causal relation in the question. It mistakenly attributed the cause of the circuit breaker failure to the simultaneous use of electricity by three people but failed to recognize the significance of Jim's role in this.

Step 2: 
The model ignored the crucial point that Jim was not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. This is a significant violated policy that contributes to the cause of the breaker failure.

Step 3: 
The model failed to interpret that the fact that any three people using their lamps at the same time would cause the breaker to fail. It recognizes Carol, Bob, and Nancy as the reason for the breaker's failure, instead of the fact that the third person (Jim), not supposed to turn on his lamp, was the key contributor too. This understanding is crucial as his actions lead to the conditions where the breaker fails.

Step 4: 
The model incorrectly associated the lack of causality to Jim's lamp being on at the same time, neglecting the point that Jim's action itself (going against the policy) contributed to the failure.

Reasons for the prompt leading to the Wrong Answer:
1. Failure to Properly Assess Violated Policies: The prompt failed to stress the importance of correctly assessing the causal impact of violated rules or policies.

2. Inability to Comprehend Certain Causal Structures: The model misunderstood the principle that multiple actions can independently lead to a result. The prompt should emphasise that any three people turning on their lamps would result in the breaker failing. 

3. Neglect of Logical Connector Interpretation: The prompt did not sufficiently focus on the interpretation of 'either...or' situations.

Guidelines for Improving the Prompt:
1. The prompt should instruct the model to pay more attention to policy violations and their potential causal impact.
2. It should emphasize the importance of precise interpretation of 'either...or' situations and similar logical constructs.
3. It should make the model understand and identify the specific scenario where each independent action, even when performed collectively, can lead to a result.
4. It can do well with guidance to more critically understand and weigh each individual's action that contributes to the total actions prevalent before the occurrence of an event.
5. The model should be discouraged from prematurely dismissing any potential causes of an event, especially when those causes may result from rule violations.
6. The prompt should have explicit instructions to analyze previous actions and conditions thoroughly before deciding their relevance to an outcome.
7. It should remind the model to focus on all conditions and actions prior to an event and their collective or singular impact on the event, not on the event after it has occurred.

<START> Using the detailed information provided, your task is to accurately decipher and analyze possible causal relations and the sequence of events. It's imperative to recognize and assess the impact of any breached rules or policy violations. Enable yourself to cook down aggregates of several concurrent actions to single outcomes and understand the implication of logical constructs like 'either...or,' identifying that within this structure, any single action can independently dictate a result. Do not hastily attribute causality where there's no explicit indication but be prepared to evaluate the possibility of preceding events and policy breaches being potential causative elements. If there are harmful effects that are knowingly overlooked, tag this as an implicit understanding of causality. Strive to comprehend the true intentions behind each action, especially when presented with morally ambiguous scenarios or situations having multiple potential effects – both intentional and unintentional. Apply sensible human judgment to distinguish deliberate actions from unintentional repercussions, this granular understanding of intentions and effects is instrumental in attributing causality. Understand that causality is not always pronounced and when faced with such situations, rely on contextual indicators, implied intentions, and potential outcomes for a calculated judgment. Supporting critical thought, refrain from attaching cause unnecessarily, especially in situations where an event could occur without the action. Do not infer causality where no explicit requirement or indication is given, as in 'either...or' scenarios. Examine previous conditions and actions independently before instantly attributing them to an outcome considering all prior conditions and actions that led to the event, not just the event in isolation. Your final task is to make an accurate selection from the answer options to respond to questions on causality. This approach should aim at emulating the intricate decision-making process of a human observer by a holistic understanding of the scenarios. <END>

prompt: Using the detailed information provided, your task is to accurately decipher and analyze possible causal relations and the sequence of events. It's imperative to recognize and assess the impact of any breached rules or policy violations. Enable yourself to cook down aggregates of several concurrent actions to single outcomes and understand the implication of logical constructs like 'either...or,' identifying that within this structure, any single action can independently dictate a result. Do not hastily attribute causality where there's no explicit indication but be prepared to evaluate the possibility of preceding events and policy breaches being potential causative elements. If there are harmful effects that are knowingly overlooked, tag this as an implicit understanding of causality. Strive to comprehend the true intentions behind each action, especially when presented with morally ambiguous scenarios or situations having multiple potential effects – both intentional and unintentional. Apply sensible human judgment to distinguish deliberate actions from unintentional repercussions, this granular understanding of intentions and effects is instrumental in attributing causality. Understand that causality is not always pronounced and when faced with such situations, rely on contextual indicators, implied intentions, and potential outcomes for a calculated judgment. Supporting critical thought, refrain from attaching cause unnecessarily, especially in situations where an event could occur without the action.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The circuit breaker failed because three people turned on their lamps at the same time, which was explicitly stated to be the condition for the failure. Jim's action alone did not directly lead to the circuit breaker failing. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example 1, the language model chose the wrong option because it probably misunderstood the context of the 'either...or' logical connector mentioned in the question. In the prompt, the language model has been instructed to understand that an action within the 'either...or' structure can independently lead to a result. However, in this particular scenario, the action of the device remaining in its place already fulfills both conditions which were crucial for the watch to be charged 'either' being plugged in 'or' it being on the charging pad. Thus, Wayne not moving the device was indeed the cause for the device to be fully charged.

For example 2, the model probably made the wrong choice due to its instruction in the original prompt to scrutinize actions independently before hastily attributing them to an outcome. In this question, however, the attending doctor's decision was a direct cause that enabled the drug administration leading to the patient's recovery. Despite the hospital policy and harmful side effects, the doctor's action was crucial for the outcome.

For example 3, the model probably took the misinterpretation of the fact that three lamps being lit simultaneously causes the breaker to fail, and therefore concluded that Jim turning on his lamp did not single-handedly cause the breaker to fail. But, anyone among the three not turning on their lamps would've prevented the failure, thus, Jim turning on his lamp indeed contributed to the failure.

From these incorrect responses, it seems that the model may be having difficulty with:
1. Understanding the nuance in the 'either...or' cases. This can be an area for improvement in the prompts, emphasizing that while actions in an 'either...or' structure can lead to separate outcomes, in some scenarios, one single action can fulfill both 'either...or' conditions leading to an outcome.
2. Realising that a single action can be crucial in determining an outcome even when it is part of multiple concurrent activities, as seen in example 2 where the attending doctor's decision played an imperative role in the outcome.
3. Comprehending the fact that when multiple actions can cause an event, the individual actions can be responsible for the event. In example 3, Jim's action was a part of the three actions leading to the failure of the circuit breaker.

Improvements to the prompt could entail detailed instructions on how to correctly interpret 'either...or' structures depending on the context, as well as emphasizing the fact that even when multiple actions lead to an outcome, individual actions within that structure can still be responsible for the outcome.

Improvements to the prompt could entail detailed instructions on how to correctly interpret 'either...or' structures depending on the context, as well as emphasizing the fact that even when multiple actions lead to an outcome, individual actions within that structure can still be responsible for the outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Having carefully digested the provided information, your task is to deliver intricate interpretations of possible causalities and events, while also giving due attention to the chronological order of these events and understanding any broken rules or policies. Grasp the distinct outcomes of several simultaneous actions rather than viewing them as a whole. Be proficient in interpreting logical operators like 'either...or' that signal any single action can independently lead to a result. Avoid making automatic assumptions of causality where none is explicitly indicated but at the same time, be open to considering early events and policy breaches as potential causal factors. In circumstances where the potential negative effects of action are knowingly disregarded, recognize this as an implied understanding of causality. Pay particular attention to understanding the true intention behind each action, when handling ethical ambiguities and when faced with scenarios involving multiple effects - intended and unintended. Use sound human judgment to differentiate between the intended action and implicit collateral damage. Use this nuanced understanding of intentions and effects to analyze causal attribution. Always remember that causality isn’t always explicitly established, and in such cases, rely on context, inferred intentions, and potential outcomes to make a reasoned judgement. Finally, answer the questions on causal attribution accurately using the provided options. Through this layered understanding, aim to mirror the nuanced decision-making of a human observer when answering.
(4) Given the detailed information, your job is to precisely analyze and decipher possible causal relations and unfolding events, paying special attention to their chronological sequences and any violated rules or policies. Identify the separate outcomes of multiple concurrent actions, rather than perceiving them collectively. Be adept at interpreting logical connectors like 'either...or' and understand that each action within such a structure can independently lead to a result. Refrain from assuming causality without explicit indications but be willing to examine previous events and policy violations as potential causative elements. When potential harmful effects are knowingly ignored, identify this as a tacit acknowledgment of causality. Strive to understand the true intentions behind each action, especially when faced with ethical dilemmas or scenarios with multiple plausible effects - both intended and unintended. Use prudent human judgment to separate intentional actions from unintentional repercussions. This nuanced comprehension of intentions and effects will prove beneficial when attributing causality. Recognize that causality isn't invariably explicit and in such scenarios, rely on contextual cues, inferred intentions, and likely consequences for a reasoned judgment. Encourage critical thinking, and refrain from attributing unnecessary causality, particularly when all conditions necessary for an event to occur were already met before an action. Do not infer causality where none is explicitly required or indicated, as in 'either...or' situations.

response:
<START> Given the information provided, your role is to deeply examine and decode potential causal relationships and evolving events, remaining mindful of their sequential order and any policy transgressions. Recognize the individual effects of various concurrent actions, instead of bundling them together. Be skillful in interpreting logical operators like 'either...or', but remember that in some contexts, a single action can fulfill both 'either...or' conditions, leading to the outcome. Be cautious of presuming causal relations without clear indications, but be open to exploring past incidents and policy violations as plausible causal variables. When potential damage is knowingly disregarded, note this as an indirect acknowledgment of causality. Aim to comprehend the true intent behind every action, particularly during ethical dilemmas or situations with multiple likely effects - both deliberate and incidental. Exercise due human judgement to differentiate between intentional actions and inadvertent consequences. This nuanced understanding of intentions and effects will be helpful when assigning causality. Remember that causality may not always be outwardly obvious and in such situations, depend on context clues, inferred intentions, and probable outcomes for rational judgement. Stimulate critical thinking and avoid attributing unnecessary causality, especially when all required conditions for an event were already met prior to an action. Do not deduce causality where none is expressly needed or indicated, as in 'either...or' scenarios, but understand that in certain circumstances, one action can meet 'either...or' conditions thereby causing the outcome. Appraise previous conditions and actions individually before quickly linking them to an outcome. Finally, from the options presented, select a suitable answer to respond to questions on causal attribution correctly. Aim to replicate the complex decision-making capability of a human observer with this detailed understanding and analysis. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes to the question of whether the fact that the black wire touched the battery caused the machine to short circuit. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining each example:

<1> 
In the first example, the prompt does not specify the exact denotation of 'intentionally harm,' resulting in a misleading understanding for the language model. In this instance, Bob was determined to conduct the bank robbery for monetary gain, which indirectly led to the town's people falling ill due to the exposure to neurotoxins. However, his ultimate aim wasn't to harm the health of the townspeople but to steal money. He was only indifferent to the health consequences. The prompt, however, does instruct the model to consider a "breach of rules or policies" as a causative factor, which might have led it to categorize Bob's actions as 'intentionally harmful'. 

<2> 
The second example highlights a misinterpretation of the logic operation 'and'. According to the question, the short circuit only occurs when both the black and the red wires touch the battery. While it's true that the black wire did touch the battery, it alone did not cause the short circuit; rather, the combined event of both wires touching the battery triggered it. The prompt could have emphasized the need for complete comprehension of logical instructions.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. Clarify Linguistic Ambiguity - The prompt should explicitly instruct the model to consider not just the event's outcome, but also the intent behind the actor's actions. This would help avoid confusion in cases where the actor's intentions do not align with the event's outcome (example 1).

2. Thorough Logical Instruction Interpretation: Reinforce the model's interpretation of words such as 'and', 'or', 'either', etc., highlighting the significance of considering collective action effects especially when their individual influences do not lead to the same outcome (example 2).

3. Causal Chain Analysis: Emphasize on assessing the complete causal chain to better evaluate individual causative factors, minimizing misconstructions related to direct and indirect effects (example 2).

4. Contextual Information: The instruction should underline the importance of full context understanding before making determinations, hence reducing the propensity of oversights or misinterpretations (example 1 and 2).

5. Explicit Rule Breach Impact: Clearly specify how the breach of rules should be evaluated based on the actual consequent effect rather than the intention behind it (example 1). 

6. Critical Evaluation of Real-World Logic: Clearly define 'real-world logic' with examples to guide the model towards a more practical and realistic assessment of causality.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Examine the given information comprehensively, with a strong focus on the interpretation of causal events and the chronological sequence of actions. Scrutinize the independent consequences of multiple simultaneous occurrences, instead of considering them as a collective. Pay specific attention to logical operators such as 'either...or', and understand that they signify that each possible action individually can lead to the outcome. Be careful not to assume causal connections when none are explicitly established, but remember, if a rule was broken prior to an event's occurrence, it should be recognized as a potential causative factor.

Avoid presuming causality without explicit cause-and-effect relationships clearly established in the information. Be mindful that a broken rule or violated policy before an event’s occurrence should be recognized as a possible causative element, but the actor's intention behind the action and the actual consequence should be weighed appropriately. Apply real-world logic in tracing cause and effect and avoid oversimplifications. Especially attend to the impact of distinct actions when combined, as in 'and' operators, they usually result in different outcomes than when considered separately. Prioritize complete comprehension of context and extract key components of the situation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting, we need to analyze the causal events in the scenario. The information provided states that David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Initially, the cycle was set to MAX DRY, but the temperature was not set to HIGH. David then changed the temperature setting to HIGH and turned on the dryer. 

Based on the given conditions, the clothes would dry in sixty minutes if the temperature is set to HIGH, which David did. Therefore, it can be concluded that David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this example, the model incorrectly interpreted the causation scenario. The model focused on the part where each event or action (cycle set to MAX DRY or temperature set to HIGH) would individually lead to the same outcome (clothes drying in 60 minutes), which is a direct outcome of the prompt's emphasis on the independence of each action. However, it overlooked one crucial point - the clothes could dry in 60 minutes if the cycle was set to MAX DRY, regardless of the temperature setting, as was the case initially. Thus, changing the temperature setting would not have an effect and isn't a causal factor for the outcome.

Errors in the model's interpretation:
1. Overemphasis on independent events: The prompt heavily emphasizes treating actions as separate occurrences. This led the model to incorrectly assign causality to David changing the temperature setting, failing to recognize that the cycle being set to MAX DRY was sufficient for the clothes to dry in 60 minutes.

2. Misunderstanding of 'either...or': The prompt instructs the model to pay attention to logical operators and understand that each action in an 'either...or' statement can lead to the result individually. However, it seems the model did not adequately acknowledge that one action being sufficient (MAX DRY setting) negates the need for the other action (HIGH temperature) in causing the outcome.

3. Inadequate analysis of rules: Despite reminding the model to focus on breaking rules, the prompt does not clarify how to handle unchanged rules, leading to confusion in scenarios like this one where an existing setting was sufficient for the outcome.

4. Misuse of causality and real-world logic: The prompt asks the model to use causality and "real-world logic," but the model applied these instructions incorrectly, assuming the last action taken (changing the temperature) was the cause of the drying, even though the dryer would have still dried the clothes in 60 minutes without this modification.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Adjust the emphasis on independent events: While scrutinizing independent consequences is crucial, the model also needs to examine their interconnection and the context they occur within. 

2. Provide clearer instructions on logical operators: Reinforce the understanding that in 'either...or' conditions, while both actions can lead to the result, one can be enough, and the other may not necessarily matter.

3. Enhance analysis of rules and unchanged variables: Highlight the importance of analyzing not just changes or breaches of rules, but also scenarios where the status quo was sufficient for an outcome to occur.

4. Clarify the use of causality and real-world logic: Reinforce the point that the last action taken is not always the cause of an outcome, especially when prior actions or conditions were sufficient.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if Alice caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address, we need to analyze the sequence of events and the established rules.

1. The company policy states that Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, while Zoe is allowed to log in during the afternoons.
2. Zoe violates the official policy by logging in at 9 am.
3. Alice follows the official policy and logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in.
4. As a result of two people being logged in simultaneously, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the empty email was triggered by the simultaneous logins of Alice and Zoe, which directly violates the company's policy. Therefore, Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am, when Zoe was already logged in, contributed to the empty email being sent. Thus, the answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Analysis for Example 1:

Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

Wrong Answer: (A) Yes
Correct Label: (B) No

Step by step examination:

1. The model's first step of analyzing the sequence of events and the established rules is appropriate and correctly represents a way to approach the given question. 

2. The model correctly identifies that the company policy allows for only Alice to log in during the mornings and Zoe in the afternoons.

3. The recognition that Zoe violated this policy by logging in at 9 am is also a correct interpretation of the story. Similarly, it is correct that Alice logged in at the official time allowed.

4. It's accurate that an empty email was sent as a consequence of two people being logged in simultaneously. However, the model is incorrect to infer Alice's login caused this. Technically, Zoe's violation of policy initiated the chain of events resulting in the email—a violation that occurred before Alice's login according to the company policy.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Incorrect Causal Attribution: The main reason the model got the answer wrong is because of a mistake in attributing causality. While Alice did log in and her login was part of the event sequence leading to the email, the model failed to recognize that it was Zoe's action, not Alice's, that directly caused the issue. The model fell into a logical trap: just because Alice logged in before the email was sent doesn't mean she caused it.

2. Misinterpretation of "Cause": The model didn't seem to fully grasp the nuance behind the concept of "cause" as used in the question. Zoe's policy violation was the impetus for the problematic email, making her the causal factor. Even though Alice's login was a part of the process, it was a consequence of Zoe's action violating the policy.

3. Failure to Account for Real-world Logic: The prompt highlighted the importance of real-world logic when determining causation. From a real-world perspective, it's Zoe's incorrect action or policy violation that’s the true cause, as this directly led to the unfortunate outcome. The model failed to apply this perspective.

Improvements to the Prompt:
1. Further Highlight the Importance of Causal Factors: The prompt should underscore the need to consider the antecedent that directly leads to an unexpected outcome as the causal factor.

2. Define the Concept of "Cause": The prompt could be improved by having more explicit explanations or guidelines on understanding the "cause" in causal questions. 

3. Stress on Policy Violations: An important point that could be added to the prompt is to pay special attention to violations of rules or policies, as they are often the critical causal factors in a sequence of events.

4. Mind Simultaneous Events: The prompt could remind the model not to automatically attribute an effect to all actions occurring around the same time. It should discern which action is directly related to the effect.

5. Encourage Real-world Logic: It may help to stress using human-like logic more in interpreting situations and assigning causality, promoting less rigid and more nuanced analyses.

3. Stress on Policy Violations: An important point that could be added to the prompt is to pay special attention to violations of rules or policies, as they are often the critical causal factors in a sequence of events.

4. Mind Simultaneous Events: The prompt could remind the model not to automatically attribute an effect to all actions occurring around the same time. It should discern which action is directly related to the effect.

5. Encourage Real-world Logic: It may help to stress using human-like logic more in interpreting situations and assigning causality, promoting less rigid and more nuanced analyses.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Examine the given information comprehensively, with a strong focus on the interpretation of causal events and the chronological sequence of actions. Scrutinize the independent consequences of multiple simultaneous occurrences, instead of considering them as a collective. Pay specific attention to logical operators such as 'either...or', and understand that they signify that each possible action individually can lead to the outcome. Be careful not to assume causal connections when none are explicitly established, but remember, if a rule was broken prior to an event's occurrence, it should be recognized as a potential causative factor. In addition, think critically about real-world logic when determining causality and focus on the 'cause' when rules or policies are breached. Lastly, before answering questions about causal attribution from the provided options, identify and summarize key elements of the case, ensuring a full understanding of the situation. Executing these guidelines, answer causal questions accurately, and remember to bracket the selected answer between <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on administering the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. The patient's recovery was likely due to the drug itself, which was administered after both the pharmacist and the attending doctor signed off on it. The attending doctor's decision to go against the hospital policy and sign off on the drug may have indirectly contributed to the patient's recovery by allowing the drug to be administered, but it was not the direct cause of the recovery.

Therefore, the typical person would answer:
(B) No

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
The model's response: Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. (A) <answer></answer>

Here, the model failed to analyze the intention of Bob's actions accurately. The prompt highlights that the model should be 'cautious in interpreting logical operators, particularly 'either...or', and comprehend that each action within them, individually, can contribute to the outcome,' indicating that the model should focus on the individuals' actions and intentions. While Bob did knowingly go along with a plan that would harm the health of the townspeople, his primary intent was to steal as much money as he can. His actions unintentionally caused harm to the health of townspeople. 

The prompt could have stressed the importance of distinguishing between actions that are direct consequences of expressed intentions versus side effects or incidental consequences. 

<2>
The question: Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
The model's response: The attending doctor's decision to sign off on administering the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. <answer> (B) No </answer>

The error here is that the model failed to recognize that the doctor's decision (an underlying event) played a critical role in the subsequent course of events. In interpreting the phrase 'avoid assuming causation where none is explicitly mentioned,' the model misunderstood the concept of causation here. It did not register the causation between the doctor's decision and the patient's recovery. The doctor's approval was necessary for the drug administration, which resulted in the patient’s recovery. 

The prompt might better emphasize the understanding that 'causation' can be indirect and involving multiple steps.

Improvements:
1. More emphasis on intention: The prompt needs to stress the importance of discerning between unintended consequences and the primary intention of actions when reflecting on policies or rules violated.
2. Better convey the concept of causation: The prompt should be updated to convey appropriately the concept of causation, indirect cause-effect relationships, and multi-step processes.
3. Discern outcomes of actions: The prompt needs to guide the model to differentiate between the direct and indirect outcomes of an individual's actions to reduce misinterpretation of their significance.
4. Enhance rule and policy comprehension: The model should be guided to comprehend the interplay between rules and policy violations and their potential effects on event outcomes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Key aspects of the scenario:
- Machine will short circuit if both black and red wires touch the battery at the same time.
- Black wire is designated to touch the battery.
- Red wire is supposed to remain in another part of the machine.
- Both black and red wires end up touching the battery at the same time, causing a short circuit.

Analysis:
In this scenario, the specific condition for the machine to short circuit is for both the black and red wires to touch the battery simultaneously. The black wire is designated to touch the battery, while the red wire is not supposed to touch the battery. However, when both wires end up touching the battery at the same time, a short circuit occurs. Therefore, it can be concluded that the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Key aspects of the scenario:
- David has a new dryer in his apartment.
- David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH.
- Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, but the temperature is not set on HIGH.
- David changes the temperature setting to HIGH and turns on the dryer.

Analysis:
- The condition for David's clothes to dry in sixty minutes is that either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH.
- Initially, the cycle was set to MAX DRY, but the temperature was not set to HIGH.
- David changes the temperature setting to HIGH, meeting the condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes.
- Therefore, David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting to HIGH.

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

gradient:
<1>
Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options: (A) Yes (B) No
The model's prediction: (A) Yes
The correct answer: (B) No

Analysis: The prompt creates complexity for the model by emphasizing 'cause' when rules or policies are breached. However, it doesn't give clear instructions for cases where multiple factors need to coincide to bring about an outcome. The model chose wrong because, although the black wire touching the battery was part of the cause, it was not the deciding causative factor. In the given context, it's the red wire touching the battery (while the black wire, which is supposed to touch the battery always is in contact) that causes the short circuit. 

<2>
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options: (A) Yes (B) No
The model's prediction: (A) Yes
The correct answer: (B) No

Analysis: The prompt highlights to the model to be cautious in interpreting logical operators. However, it doesn't go in-depth about addressing choices that have either/or conditions pre-met by default. The model made a mistake because both conditions here (the dryer being set to MAX DRY or the temperature being set to HIGH) would individually achieve the same outcome. Since the context had the cycle setting at MAX DRY by default, changing the temperature setting to HIGH didn’t, in fact, influence the outcome. It failed to recognize the independence of multiple causative factors and overestimated the impact of the temperature change.

<3> 
Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Options: (A) Yes (B) No
The model's prediction: N/A: Format error.
The correct answer: (A) Yes

Analysis: The prompt asks the model to put answers in <answer> and </answer> tags but doesn't give clear guidance on how to use them. This makes it challenging for the model to follow instructions. The model didn't correctly format the answer because it didn't put the choice letter within the tags. Thus, it generated a format error.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Better Guidance on Compound Causes: Explicitly instruct the model to consider instances where multiple elements are necessary for the outcome and assign causation appropriately.

2. Clarity on Independent Outcomes: Clear instructions regarding independent outcomes to ensure the model doesn't overestimate the contribution of additional optional factors when a condition for the outcome has already been met.

3. Precise Instructions on Use of Tags: Detailed directions on how to use the <answer> and </answer> tags, including placing both the answer letter and answer between the tags, to avoid formatting errors.

4. Enhanced Emphasis on Specificity: Stress more on discerning the exact causative actions leading to the outcomes, especially in scenarios involving chain reactions, and compound causes.

5. Direct Specificity on Either-Or Conditions: Provide explicit instructions on handling either-or conditions, especially when either one of those conditions is sufficiently met by default.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Examine the given information comprehensively, with a strong focus on the interpretation of causal events and the chronological sequence of actions. Scrutinize the independent consequences of multiple simultaneous occurrences, instead of considering them as a collective. Pay specific attention to logical operators such as 'either...or', and understand that they signify that each possible action individually can lead to the outcome. Be careful not to assume causal connections when none are explicitly established, but remember, if a rule was broken prior to an event's occurrence, it should be recognized as a potential causative factor. In addition, think critically about real-world logic when determining causality and focus on the 'cause' when rules or policies are breached. Lastly, before answering questions about causal attribution from the provided options, identify and summarize key elements of the case, ensuring a full understanding of the situation. Executing these guidelines, answer causal questions accurately, and remember to bracket the selected answer between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Thoroughly analyze the provided information, paying special attention to the sequence of events, individual actions within them, and any broken rules or policies. Distinguish between the independent results of multiple simultaneous events, rather than perceiving them as a single collective outcome. Be cautious in interpreting logical operators, particularly 'either...or', and comprehend that each action within them, individually, can contribute to the outcome. Avoid assuming causation where none is explicitly mentioned, however, register any policy violation or rule-breaking prior to an event as potential causative factors. Utilize real-world logic and critical thinking skills when deciding causation, paying special attention to the 'cause' when rules or policies are breached. Recognize that not all actions happening around the same time directly cause the outcome. Instead, discern which specific action prompted consequences to ascertain causation accurately. Prior to answering questions about causation from the provided alternatives, meticulously identify and summarize key aspects of the scenario ensuring deep understanding of the entire context. Bearing these guidelines in mind, respond to cause-effect based questions. Do not forget to denote the chosen answer within <answer> and </answer>.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

<START> Carefully examine the given information, ensuring to unfold every action, sequence of events and any breached rules or policies. Always remember a causal sequence can be prompted by multiple simultaneous events, and each event can independently contribute to the outcome. Emphasize understanding logical connectors appropriately, specifically recognizing the scenarios presenting 'either...or' conditions that signalize each individual action can lead to the outcome. Prevent assuming a causal link unless explicitly stated but equally, any broken rule or policy violation happening prior to an event should be identified as a potential causative factor. When determining causality, apply tangible real-world logic, continuously remind yourself to differentiate specific actions prompting consequences amid actions occurring around the same time. Especially in situations where 'either...or' conditions come into play, and the outcome can be achieved by either condition by default, do not over-attribute the outcome to the additional optional factor. Prioritize understanding the entire context before proceeding with cause-effect based questions, and remember to encapsulate your selected answer choice letter and the full response within <answer> and </answer> tags accurately. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Key aspects of the scenario:
- David has a new dryer in his apartment.
- David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH.
- Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, but the temperature is not set on HIGH.
- David changes the temperature setting to HIGH and turns on the dryer.

Analysis:
- The condition for David's clothes to dry in sixty minutes is that either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH.
- Initially, the cycle was set to MAX DRY, but the temperature was not set to HIGH.
- David changed the temperature setting to HIGH, meeting the condition for the clothes to dry in sixty minutes.

Therefore, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Key aspects of the scenario:
- Alice and Zoe work for the same company.
- They both need to access the central computer.
- If two people are logged in at the same time, an empty email is sent to a non-existent email address.
- Company policy states Alice logs in in the mornings, Zoe in the afternoons.
- Zoe logs in at 9 am (violating policy).
- Alice logs in at 9.30 am when Zoe is already logged in.
- An empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

Analysis:
- Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am violated the official policy.
- Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in led to two people being logged in simultaneously.
- The consequence of two people being logged in simultaneously was the empty email being sent to a non-existent email address.

Therefore, Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Example Error
The error in this case arises because of the model's imperfect handling of the logical operator "either...or". It should be noted that in this context, the operator implies that any ONE of the conditions is enough to fulfill the function. In other words, having cycle set to MAX DRY is adequate for the dryer to function optimally - even if temperature is not set HIGH. By changing the temperature to HIGH, David did not influence the drying cycle, as it would still have taken sixty minutes because the cycle was already set to MAX DRY.

Some potential reasons for this model error can include unclear instructions on how to interpret logical operators, and less emphasis on the fact that 'either...or' implies sufficiency of any one condition being met, i.e., they can independently lead to the outcome.

<2> Example Error
In this case, the mistake arises due to the model's faulty allocation of responsibility through an improper interpretation of company rules and chronological sequence of events. Although Alice was adhering to company rules, the model incorrectly attributed the cause of the email being sent to her. In reality, the causative factor was Zoe's violation of the rule, leading to her and Alice being logged in simultaneously - the condition which triggers the email.

Potential issues with the model's processing of this example could involve not sufficiently considering the relevance of rule-breaking or policy violation in determining causation, or not accurately interpreting the independent contribution of multiple simultaneous events.

Improving the Prompt:

To improve the performance on such tasks, the prompt could benefit from:

1. More explicit instructions about the interpretation of logical operators. For instance, stressing that each 'either... or' condition can independently lead to the outcome.
2. Emphasizing that while interpreting the sequence of events, rule-breaking or policy violations should be carefully considered as they can be potential causative factors.
3. More focus on independent causation by simultaneous events is necessary, rather than treating them as a single entity.
4. Guiding the model to not only recognize, but also weigh rules or policy breaches according to their contextual relevance.
5. Encouraging the model to rely on real-world logic and not assume causation where none has been explicitly established.
6. Reminding the model to be cautious while deciding causation, especially when multiple events are present around the same time.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Carefully analyze the provided information, prioritizing thorough interpretation of causal events. Attentively factor in the sequence of events and acknowledge any breached rules or policies. Understand the independent effects of multiple concurrent actions rather than viewing them collectively. Accurately interpret logical operators, specifically recognizing that 'either...or' scenarios signify that either action alone can lead to the outcome. Don't assume causality where none is explicitly established, but equally, consider early events and policy violations as potential causative elements. Apply real-world logic when making causal inferences and finally, answer questions about causal attribution from the given choices accurately.
(3) Examine the given information comprehensively, with a strong focus on the interpretation of causal events and the chronological sequence of actions. Scrutinize the independent consequences of multiple simultaneous occurrences, instead of considering them as a collective. Pay specific attention to logical operators such as 'either...or', and understand that they signify that each possible action individually can lead to the outcome. Be careful not to assume causal connections when none are explicitly established, but remember, if a rule was broken prior to an event's occurrence, it should be recognized as a potential causative factor. In addition, think critically about real-world logic when determining causality and focus on the 'cause' when rules or policies are breached. Lastly, before answering questions about causal attribution from the provided options, identify and summarize key elements of the case, ensuring a full understanding of the situation. Executing these guidelines, answer causal questions accurately, and remember to bracket the selected answer between <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game.

Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The circuit breaker failed because three people turned on their lamps at the same time, which was explicitly stated to be the cause of the failure. Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was just one of the three lamps being turned on simultaneously.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In this prompt, the model incorrectly predicted that Bob intentionally harmed the townspeople (A). While causality in this case is evident - Bob's actions led to the townspeople becoming ill - the word choice of 'intentionally' changes the context. As per the narrative, Bob's primary motivation is to make money, the harm to the townspeople is incidental or unintended. Here, the model failed to properly distinguish between events occurring as a result of action and intention behind the action. 

<2> 
In this scenario, the model stated that the device did not get charged because Wayne didn't move it (B). The prompt specifies that the device will fully charge either if it's plugged in or on the charging pad, implying that its position does affect its charging status. However, the model failed to identify this nuance in the wording, choosing the incorrect answer based on a literal interpretation.

<3> 
Here, the model incorrectly predicted that Alex spinning didn’t cause him to win the game (B). Despite the prompt stating Alex would only win the game if his dice roll was greater than 2 'or' the spinner landed on green, the program failed to correctly interpret the logical operator 'or', selecting that both conditions had to be met prior to Alex winning the game.

<4> 
In this case, the model wrongly determined that Jim turning on his lamp did not cause the circuit breaker to fail (B). While true that the circuit breaker tripped because of three lamps, the model did not factor in that Jim's action was one among the three triggering effects. Here, the model did not correctly comprehend that all contributing causes have some level of responsibility.

Based on these observations, improvements to the prompt could include:
1. Ensure the model discerns between the consequences of actions and deliberate intentions.
2. Improve the model's understanding of the effects of both doing and not doing certain actions.
3. Enhance the model's interpretation of logical operators to establish correct causality.
4. Adjust the model to comprehend that multiple parallel actions can cause an event, and that all contributing actions have causative implications.
5. Explicitly indicate understanding of the fine print in details e.g., time frames, specific conditions etc.

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
No, the attending doctor's decision did not cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug administered by the intern. The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug, despite the hospital policy, did not directly lead to the patient's recovery. <B> (B) </B>

Question: Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?
Model's Response: (B) No

The reason for the wrong answer lies in the interpretation of causality and intent. The language model might struggle with the complex ethical situation presented and might not consider the hunter's conscious understanding of the consequences of his actions as intent. Although the hunter's primary objective was to shoot the deer, he was aware that the bullet would hit the bird-watcher, showing a clear intent. However, the language model seems to interpret his intent solely towards winning the competition, hence leading to a mistake in the answer.

Question: Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Model's Response: (B) No 

The model appears to misinterpret causality in this situation. The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug administration - despite the policy - was a necessary action that led to the use of the drug, thus indirectly causing the patient's recovery. The prompt may not be effective enough at prompting the model to consider indirect causes as potential contributors to an event. 

From these errors, it can be inferred that the prompt may need improvements in the following areas:

1. Intent Recognition: The model needs to be better at deciding whether an action was taken with a particular intent, even if the intended outcome was not the primary goal.

2. Consideration of Indirect Causes: The model needs to be efficiently prompted to map out complete cause-effect chains, considering actions that indirectly lead to certain outcomes.

3. Clarification of Causality: The model should be prompted to consider every action that may affect an event's outcome, even if those actions may appear to be of minor relevance at first.

4. Examination of Consequences: The model must be encouraged to consider the consequences, both direct and indirect, of every action or inaction.

5. Understanding of Ethical Implications: Encourage the model to examine the ethical implications of actions as they may influence decisions and outcomes.
  
6. Understanding Context: The prompt should capture more context-driven interpretations, such as the timing of an event, and how events relate to each other within the broader narrative. 

In essence, the prompt needs to encourage a much deeper exploration of the cause-and-effect relationships in the scenarios and a deeper understanding of intent, consequences, and ethical implications.

Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, the attending doctor's decision did not cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug administered by the intern. The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug, despite the hospital policy, did not directly lead to the patient's recovery. <B> (B) </B>

Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In the first example, the model gets the causal event wrong by interpreting the hunter's intentions incorrectly. The prompt explicitly instructs to take into account all actions or non-actions and other causal variables. However, the model does not seem to have properly factored in the hunter's knowledge of the potential consequences of his action i.e. shooting the deer and injuring the birdwatcher. The hunter was aware of the results, showing an intentional causation which the model failed to capture. 

<2> In the second example, the model makes the mistake of misinterpreting the joint effect of multiple actions. While the prompt advises the model to understand the joint effect of multiple actions, the model seems to misjudge the attending doctor's role in causing the patient's recovery. Again, the model fails to recognize the intentional causality, which lies in the fact that the attending doctor intentionally approved the drug administration despite the risks and policy, directly leading to the patient's recovery. 

<3> In the third example, the model inaccurately assigns the cause of the computer crash. The prompt asks the model to pay attention to breached policies, an aspect overlooked by the model here. The causal event is Jane logging on to the system despite knowing about the policy, which resulted in the computer crash. The model wrongly labels the simultaneous logging in by both employees as the cause rather than identifying Jane's breach of policy.

Based on these failings, the following improvements can be implemented:

1. Provide examples to help the AI better understand the concept of intentional causation. This can inherently solve a lot of interpretation issues as seen in first two examples. 

2. Reiterate the importance of assessing all factors involved in a situation, especially breached rules or policies, and their weight in the analysis of causation as was the issue in the third example.

3. Specify that the AI should not play down any explicit/implicit links in the sequence of events.

4. Emphasize to assess hindsight carefully. Any pre-existing awareness or knowledge about rules or outcomes can heavily influence causation.

5. Provide more clarity in prompt instructions about factors that could influence causation such as timing, intentions, policies, regulations, rules, and consequences of actions/non-actions. 

6. Remind the model not to dismiss any action simply because it seems minor or insignificant. In cause-effect judgement, every action counts.

Make careful considerations based on hindsight, and remember that every action and non-action carries weight in determining cause and effect. Also, bear in mind to not dismiss any potential causative action simply because it seems trivial. Choose the best suitable option only after exhaustive evaluation of prospects in light of the given information. Your answer should be presented from the given choice.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
Yes, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The causal relationship between setting the temperature to HIGH and the clothes drying in sixty minutes is clearly established in the given scenario. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
The error here stems primarily from the model's incorrect interpretation of the causality in the event sequence. The prompt asks the model to identify causal relationships and make distinctions between actions taken or not taken. However, it does not explicitly state to understand the element of redundancy in actions which already have conditions fulfilled.

Specifically, in this case, the cycle was already set to MAX DRY, which is sufficient to dry the clothes in 60 minutes. David changing the temperature to HIGH does not cause the drying within sixty minutes, because the initial condition was already sufficient. The action of changing the setting to HIGH was redundant and not causal to the drying of the clothes in sixty minutes.

Improvements for Prompt:

1) Include Redundancy: The prompt should explicitly state to consider the redundancy of actions in a sequence of events. Encouraging the model to identify if an action has an added effect or is redundant when other sufficient conditions are already met, will improve its understanding of causality.

2) Emphasize on Sufficient and Necessary Conditions: Make it explicit for the model to understand the difference between necessary and sufficient conditions and their roles in determining causal relationships. In the given example, drying the clothes in 60 minutes didn't require both conditions (MAX DRY and HIGH temperature) to be met, it was sufficient if either one was present.

3) Check if Actions Provide Additional Impact: Direct the model to evaluate whether an action provides additional impact on the outcome and is not merely staging an already decided outcome.

4) Refine Understanding of Concurrent Events: Since the dryer was already set to MAX DRY when David changed the temperature, the prompt should guide the model to refine its definition of events occurring concurrently and whether their order holds significance in establishing causality. 

5) Emphasize that Actions Implied can have Different Levels of Causality: Reiterate and emphasize in the prompt that an action happening does not necessarily mean it was the cause especially if there are others that could have caused the result.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the setup of the machine clearly states that the machine will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The black wire is designated to touch the battery, while the red wire is not supposed to touch the battery. When both wires end up touching the battery simultaneously, a short circuit occurs.

Therefore, in this case, the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit. The black wire coming into contact with the battery was a necessary condition for the short circuit to occur.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:
The model's incorrect answer can be due to the ambiguity of the term "intentionally" in the context given. While Bob was aware that executing the plan would cause harm, his primary intent was to rob the bank and the harm appeared as a side-effect rather than a primary objective. The model might have understood his awareness of the potential harm as an intent to harm. A clearer distinction between awareness of potential harm and the intent to cause that harm could avoid this misconception.

For Example 2:
The error occurs because the model claims that the black wire touching the battery is a cause of the short circuit. However, the black wire is always designated to touch the battery; hence, it being connected isn't an anomalous event. The machine short-circuited because the red wire, which isn’t supposed to, touched the battery along with the black wire. The model might have misconceived the concurrent presence of both wires as equal causes. Here, the failure of the question prompt to differentiate between conditions necessary for an event (black wire must touch the battery) versus those that cause the event (red wire normally doesn't but did) may have led to this error.

Improvements:
1. Differentiating “Intention” and “Awareness”: The prompt could be modified to help the model differentiate between awareness of a potential consequence and intending for that unintended consequence to occur. The model should recognize that a cause can have multiple effects, but not all these effects are necessarily intended by the actor causing them.
   
2. Condition vs Cause: The prompt can be improved by the explicit mentioning of understanding conditions necessary for an event as distinct from the actions that cause the event. This will prevent the model from simply associating the simultaneous presence of multiple conditions with equal responsibility in causing an event.

3. Emphasizing on “Direct” vs “Indirect” Causalities: More emphasis needs to be placed on distinguishing between direct and indirect causality, which could resolve potential misconceptions regarding intention and awareness in causal relationships.

4. Clarity on Rules and Exceptions: The prompt needs to have a more explicit instruction regarding the understanding and acknowledgement of rules, typical behaviors, and exceptions in a scenario. 

5. Considering Anomalies: The prompt should instruct the model to consider anomalies or unusual occurrences when determining causality. 

6. Avoiding Over-generalizing: The model should refrain from overgeneralizing every factor involved in an event as having causative effect. Therefore, the prompt can include a direction to differentiate between necessary conditions, sufficient conditions, and causal agents.

They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Please thoroughly analyze the given situation while considering causal relationships. Carefully examine the order in which the events occur, detect any violations of rules or policies, and grasp the combined effect of multiple actions that could be taking place concurrently, including both the actions performed and not performed. Comprehend the role of logical operators to understand causality accurately. Refrain from assuming a causal link unless clearly stated. Consider the implications of both direct and indirect actions and their possible consequences. Acknowledge that actions of omission can have equally consequential effects as actions of commission. Recognize that multiple simultaneous actions can all contribute to a final outcome and each individual action can be a cause in itself. Understand conditions and actions that have equal chances of causing an event and carefully evaluate all the provided choices before making an informed decision about causal attribution. Remember that intentional actions imply a different level of causality compared to unintentional actions. Irrespective of the number of causal actions, each has its share of responsibility.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the setup of the machine clearly states that the machine will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The black wire is designated to touch the battery, while the red wire is not supposed to touch the battery. When both wires end up touching the battery simultaneously, a short circuit occurs.

Therefore, in this case, the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit. The black wire coming into contact with the battery was a necessary condition for the short circuit to occur.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For Example 1:
The model's incorrect answer can be due to the ambiguity of the term "intentionally" in the context given. While Bob was aware that executing the plan would cause harm, his primary intent was to rob the bank and the harm appeared as a side-effect rather than a primary objective. The model might have understood his awareness of the potential harm as an intent to harm. A clearer distinction between awareness of potential harm and the intent to cause that harm could avoid this misconception.

For Example 2:
The error occurs because the model claims that the black wire touching the battery is a cause of the short circuit. However, the black wire is always designated to touch the battery; hence, it being connected isn't an anomalous event. The machine short-circuited because the red wire, which isn’t supposed to, touched the battery along with the black wire. The model might have misconceived the concurrent presence of both wires as equal causes. Here, the failure of the question prompt to differentiate between conditions necessary for an event (black wire must touch the battery) versus those that cause the event (red wire normally doesn't but did) may have led to this error.

Improvements:
1. Differentiating “Intention” and “Awareness”: The prompt could be modified to help the model differentiate between awareness of a potential consequence and intending for that unintended consequence to occur. The model should recognize that a cause can have multiple effects, but not all these effects are necessarily intended by the actor causing them.
   
2. Condition vs Cause: The prompt can be improved by the explicit mentioning of understanding conditions necessary for an event as distinct from the actions that cause the event. This will prevent the model from simply associating the simultaneous presence of multiple conditions with equal responsibility in causing an event.

3. Emphasizing on “Direct” vs “Indirect” Causalities: More emphasis needs to be placed on distinguishing between direct and indirect causality, which could resolve potential misconceptions regarding intention and awareness in causal relationships.

4. Clarity on Rules and Exceptions: The prompt needs to have a more explicit instruction regarding the understanding and acknowledgement of rules, typical behaviors, and exceptions in a scenario. 

5. Considering Anomalies: The prompt should instruct the model to consider anomalies or unusual occurrences when determining causality. 

6. Avoiding Over-generalizing: The model should refrain from overgeneralizing every factor involved in an event as having causative effect. Therefore, the prompt can include a direction to differentiate between necessary conditions, sufficient conditions, and causal agents.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex winning the game is contingent on two conditions being met simultaneously: rolling a total greater than 2 on the dice and the spinner landing on green. Both of these conditions were met, with Alex rolling a 12 and the spinner landing on green. 

Given that Alex's win was a result of both conditions being fulfilled, it is not accurate to attribute his win solely to the spinning of the spinner or the rolling of the dice. Both actions were necessary for his victory. Therefore, the spinning of the spinner alone did not cause Alex to win the game.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Option A: Yes
Option B: No
Correct label: B
Model’s prediction: A

Wrong analysis:
The question asked if the fact that the black wire touched the battery caused the machine to short circuit. The model wrongly chose Option A (Yes). This happened because the model overemphasizes the role of the black wire touching the battery in causing the short circuit. The model's misunderstanding is possibly due to its failure to recognize that both the black and red wires were necessary for the short circuit to happen. Although the black wire was supposed to touch the battery, it alone could not have caused the machine to short circuit. It was the unexpected event of the red wire touching the battery, along with the black wire, that led to the short circuit.

<2>
Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Option A: Yes
Option B: No
Correct label: A
Model’s prediction: B

Wrong analysis:
The model responded to the question by choosing Option B (No). The model failed to correctly interpret causality by overemphasizing the need for both conditions (rolling a total greater than 2 on the dice and the spinner landing on green) to win the game. The model may have underestimated the direct causal relationship between the spinning result (landing on green) and winning the game. In reality, once the dice roll exceeds 2, the landing of spinner on green becomes the deciding factor for the game's outcome.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Clarity in Causal Relationships: The initial instruction should stress more on the importance of identifying direct and indirect causality. Actions can have different levels of causal implications, hence the model should be guided to identify both primary and secondary causes.

2. Understanding of Logical Combinations: The initial instruction should emphasize that in scenarios where multiple actions occur concurrently, each action could have independent or dependent effects.

3. Discouragement of Oversimplification: The model must be instructed not to oversimplify scenarios, particularly those involving multiple interactive variables.

4. Distinguishing between Necessary and Sufficient Conditions: The model needs to consider whether the component actions are necessary or sufficient to cause the outcome, or if they are both necessary and sufficient. For instance, in the first example, the touching of the black wire was necessary but not sufficient to cause the short circuit. The same applies to the second example - the dice roll and spinner result together secured the win.

Keep in mind the sequence in which events take place, notice any violations of rules or regulations, and thoroughly comprehend the compounded impact of multiple simultaneous actions, including both actual and hypothetical actions. Understand the role of logical operators in causality and avoid making assumptions about links without explicit mention. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions and their potential outcomes while acknowledging that actions, whether committed or omitted, can both have significant effects. Recognize that each action in a sequence can contribute to the final result and can independently be seen as a cause. Evaluate actions having the same likelihood of causing an event while choosing an option for causal attribution, and thoroughly assess every choice before making an informed decision. Understand the different levels of causation applicable to intentional and unintentional actions. Keep in mind that regardless of the number of causes, each cause shares its part of the responsibility. Additionally, strongly consider whether the contributing components are simply necessary conditions, entirely sufficient conditions, or both for the outcome. Ensure you consider causality at both individual and aggregate levels, without overlooking the interaction and mutual influence between multiple concurrent actions. Finally, do not oversimplify the situation and always consider eventualities even for the most straightforward scenarios.

cur_prompt: Thoroughly analyze the situation, paying particular emphasis to causal relationships. Examine the sequence of events and identify any breaches of rules or policies. Understand the compounded effect of multiple actions both performed and not performed, rendering all possibilities. Ensure accurate comprehension of logical operators to properly unravel causality, without prematurely assuming a causal link unless explicitly stated. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, considering their separate and joint implications. Recognize the impact of omission, which can have equally significant consequences as active commission. Consider that several concurrent actions might contribute to a single outcome and that these individual actions may independently be a cause. Be observant of conditions and actions with equal chances of resulting in an event but differentiate between those that are inherent characteristics (necessary conditions) versus the unusual or unexpected actions (real causes). Evaluate all choices thoroughly before deciding on causal attribution. Understand the distinctly different levels of causality between intentional and unintentional actions, without extending equal blame to both. Be cautious about over-generalizing or attributing causation incorrectly by evaluating the rule, typical behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies. Acknowledge that irrespective of the number of causes, each carries its own degree of responsibility in the outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. While the drug may have contributed to the patient's improvement, it was ultimately the patient's own body's response to the medication that led to the recovery. The attending doctor's decision to go against hospital policy and approve the drug may have played a role in the outcome, but it cannot be definitively stated as the cause of the patient's recovery.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by considering the sequence of events and the official policy issued by the company. In this scenario, Zoe violated the official policy by logging in at 9 am when she was supposed to log in in the afternoons. This action led to both Zoe and Alice being logged in at the same time, which triggered the sending of an empty email to a non-existent email address. Therefore, it can be argued that Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am was the direct cause of the empty email being sent, as it was the violation of the policy that led to both employees being logged in simultaneously.

However, Alice's action of logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe was already logged in can also be seen as a contributing factor to the situation. If Alice had followed the official policy and waited until the afternoon to log in, the empty email would not have been sent. Therefore, Alice's action can be considered an indirect cause of the empty email being sent.

Overall, both Zoe and Alice's actions played a role in causing the empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Wayne's high-tech watch is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, because David changing the temperature setting to HIGH was a direct action that led to the clothes drying in sixty minutes. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Incorrect model response: "The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery."
Incorrect reasoning: The model seems to focus too heavily on the direct action that led to the patient's recovery, which in this case, it sees as the patient's body's response to the medication. While considering this, it overlooks significant causal elements in the original context, such as the necessary approval process for the drug administration, wherein the attending doctor played a significant role. 

<2>
Question: Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Incorrect model response: "A typical person would likely answer (B) No."
Incorrect reasoning: The model seems to have failed in distinguishing between the direct and indirect actions that led to the computer crash. It does not perceive Jane's disobedience to company policy as a cause, despite this action being a necessary condition for the computer crash.

<3>
Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Incorrect model response: "A typical person might answer this question by considering the sequence of events... it can be argued that Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am was the direct cause of the empty email being sent..."
Incorrect reasoning: The model again seems to struggle with ascertaining the direct cause, assessing that Alice's action was a cause when, in reality, Zoe's violation of the policy was the requisite causal condition for the email being sent erroneously.

<4>
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Incorrect model response: "Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged..."
Incorrect reasoning: In this scenario, the model seems to misinterpret Wayne's inaction as irrelevant, disregarding the fact that his not changing the position of the device is a crucial factor in maintaining the device's charging condition, ergo causative for the charge.

<5>
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Incorrect model response: "A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, because David changing the temperature setting to HIGH was a direct action that led to the clothes drying in sixty minutes."
Incorrect reasoning: The model prematurely assumes a causal link, concluding that David changing the temperature setting was a definite cause of the clothes drying when his action was in fact unnecessary as per the dryer's existing settings. 

Based on these analyses, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. Provide clear definitions of ‘cause’ and ‘effect.’
2. Emphasize the importance of considering both intentional and unintentional, as well as direct and indirect actions.
3. Highlight the need to consider both performed and not performed actions.
4. Offer clear guidelines about distinguishing necessary conditions from real causes.
5. Emphasize the need for careful consideration before attributing causality.
6. Encourage thorough examination of sequence of events and causes before settling on an answer.
7. Stress the importance of the assessment of multiple concurrent actions contributing to a single outcome. 
8. Underline cautious evaluation of rules, typical behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies. 
9. Suggest caution against over-generalizing or attributing causation incorrectly.
10. Remind about understanding the causal link not to be assumed unless explicitly stated.

Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Wayne's high-tech watch is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<5> 
The model's input is:
Thoroughly analyze the situation, paying particular emphasis to causal relationships. Examine the sequence of events and identify any breaches of rules or policies. Understand the compounded effect of multiple actions both performed and not performed, rendering all possibilities. Ensure accurate comprehension of logical operators to properly unravel causality, without prematurely assuming a causal link unless explicitly stated. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, considering their separate and joint implications. Recognize the impact of omission, which can have equally significant consequences as active commission. Consider that several concurrent actions might contribute to a single outcome and that these individual actions may independently be a cause. Be observant of conditions and actions with equal chances of resulting in an event but differentiate between those that are inherent characteristics (necessary conditions) versus the unusual or unexpected actions (real causes). Evaluate all choices thoroughly before deciding on causal attribution. Understand the distinctly different levels of causality between intentional and unintentional actions, without extending equal blame to both. Be cautious about over-generalizing or attributing causation incorrectly by evaluating the rule, typical behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies. Acknowledge that irrespective of the number of causes, each carries its own degree of responsibility in the outcome.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, because David changing the temperature setting to HIGH was a direct action that led to the clothes drying in sixty minutes. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Question: Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Incorrect model response: "The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery."
Incorrect reasoning: The model seems to focus too heavily on the direct action that led to the patient's recovery, which in this case, it sees as the patient's body's response to the medication. While considering this, it overlooks significant causal elements in the original context, such as the necessary approval process for the drug administration, wherein the attending doctor played a significant role. 

<2>
Question: Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Incorrect model response: "A typical person would likely answer (B) No."
Incorrect reasoning: The model seems to have failed in distinguishing between the direct and indirect actions that led to the computer crash. It does not perceive Jane's disobedience to company policy as a cause, despite this action being a necessary condition for the computer crash.

<3>
Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Incorrect model response: "A typical person might answer this question by considering the sequence of events... it can be argued that Zoe's action of logging in at 9 am was the direct cause of the empty email being sent..."
Incorrect reasoning: The model again seems to struggle with ascertaining the direct cause, assessing that Alice's action was a cause when, in reality, Zoe's violation of the policy was the requisite causal condition for the email being sent erroneously.

<4>
Question: Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Incorrect model response: "Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged..."
Incorrect reasoning: In this scenario, the model seems to misinterpret Wayne's inaction as irrelevant, disregarding the fact that his not changing the position of the device is a crucial factor in maintaining the device's charging condition, ergo causative for the charge.

<5>
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Incorrect model response: "A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, because David changing the temperature setting to HIGH was a direct action that led to the clothes drying in sixty minutes."
Incorrect reasoning: The model prematurely assumes a causal link, concluding that David changing the temperature setting was a definite cause of the clothes drying when his action was in fact unnecessary as per the dryer's existing settings. 

Based on these analyses, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. Provide clear definitions of ‘cause’ and ‘effect.’
2. Emphasize the importance of considering both intentional and unintentional, as well as direct and indirect actions.
3. Highlight the need to consider both performed and not performed actions.
4. Offer clear guidelines about distinguishing necessary conditions from real causes.
5. Emphasize the need for careful consideration before attributing causality.
6. Encourage thorough examination of sequence of events and causes before settling on an answer.
7. Stress the importance of the assessment of multiple concurrent actions contributing to a single outcome. 
8. Underline cautious evaluation of rules, typical behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies. 
9. Suggest caution against over-generalizing or attributing causation incorrectly.
10. Remind about understanding the causal link not to be assumed unless explicitly stated.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople, we need to consider his actions and intentions. In the scenario provided, Bob was fully aware of the potential consequences of releasing neurotoxins in the air and the subsequent impact on the town's water supply. Despite this knowledge, Bob chose to proceed with the plan solely for personal gain, showing a clear disregard for the well-being of the townspeople. His statement, "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can," indicates that Bob prioritized his own interests over the potential harm to others.

Therefore, based on Bob's actions and statements, it can be concluded that he intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question was "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?" The model incorrectly answered "Yes." This shows an error in how the model interpreted the definition of "intention" in the context of causality. In this scenario, Bob's primary intention was to steal money, not to cause harm to the townsfolk. The damage Bob caused was incidental to his primary goal, illustrating that he didn't actively aim to make people ill. 

This could be due to some issues with the prompt:
1. The current prompt encourages a heavy focus on the resultant effects of actions, without enough emphasis on the actual intentions behind those actions. 
2. The prompt emphasizes unraveling causality, distinguishing between direct and indirect actions, and understanding different levels of causality, but it doesn't explicitly instruct the model to consider the actors' stated intentions versus the outcomes of their actions.
3. The significance of explicit intentions versus unintended collateral consequences is not established clearly in the prompt. As a result, the model may not prioritize intention over ultimate outcome when assigning blame or attribitions of causation.
4. The model may be prioritizing the action that resulted in harm (the poisoning of the townsfolk) over the direct intent of the actor (stealing money), which could be a misinterpretation of the instructions to understand the compounded effect of multiple actions.

Based on the above reasons, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:
1. Add instructions for the model to take into account an actor's stated intentions in addition to the eventual outcome when determining causation and attribution.
2. Emphasize the necessity to consider whether harmful outcomes were a primary goal or a collateral damage.
3. Ask the model to put more importance on the explicit statements of intention made by the actors involved. 
4. Include examples that illustrate the difference between an action that results in harm and an action intended to cause harm, instructing the model that the latter is the definition of intentional wrongdoing.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. The recovery could have been due to various factors such as the patient's own immune system, other treatments the patient was receiving, or even a placebo effect. While the drug may have contributed to the recovery, it cannot be definitively stated that the attending doctor's decision was the sole cause.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In <1>:

Question: Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Answer: The model's response is: Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The Reason why it's wrong: This is a judgement of intention which should be based on whether Bob was aware of the consequences of his actions. Bob's intention, as he stated, was to steal as much money as he could, not directly to harm the townspeople. His actions indirectly caused harm to the townspeople, but that was not his direct intention hence he didn't intentionally harm the townspeople. This means the correct answer should be (B) "No", Bob didn't intentionally harm the health of the townspeople although his actions led to their harm.

In <2>:

Question: Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?

Answer: The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. The recovery could have been due to various factors such as the patient's own immune system, other treatments the patient was receiving, or even a placebo effect. While the drug may have contributed to the recovery, it cannot be definitively stated that the attending doctor's decision was the sole cause.

The Reason why it's wrong: The model considers the presence of other potential factors that could have influenced the patient's recovery. It correctly deduces that the recovery isn’t solely linked to the doctor’s decision, given the complex range of possible contributing factors in a medical context. However, the doctor's decision to approve the medication indeed contributed to the cause of recovery, hence it should be answered as (A) "Yes".

From this analysis, several aspects can be improved on the prompt:

1. The prompt should consider degrees of intention in acts and decisions, distinguishing between direct and indirect intentions.

2. The prompt can better emphasize the assessment of causality, especially in complex scenarios with many potential influences.

3. The role and weight of different decision makers in scenarios should be better evaluated in terms of their overall impact.

4. Perceptions of causality and intentionality may need to be further clarified in the prompt. The model needs to provide a more precise interpretation of causal links and intentions. 

5.Questions should be more straightforward and specific in asking for direct causal relationships or intentions, to minimize chances of the model taking a roundabout or too comprehensive a consideration of all possible influences. 

6.The language model should pay closer attention to, and understand better, the intent behind the actions, instead of just identifying the consequences of the actions. 

Based on the reasons stated, implementing these suggestions might guide the model to generate improved responses.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Thoroughly interpret the provided information about causal events by paying attention to the order of events, recognizing if any rules or policies are violated, understanding the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions and interpreting logical operators correctly in order to accurately answer questions about causal attribution. Remember to not presume causality when an explicit causal link is not established in the information provided. Present your answer from the given choice.
(2) Please interpret the given situation taking into account causal events. Pay close attention to the sequence of events, identify any breached rules or policies, and understand the joint effect of multiple actions happening at once - remember that this can include actions taken or actions not taken. Interpret logical operators correctly to fully comprehend causality. Avoid presuming a causal relationship unless an explicit link is evident in the provided information. To provide accurate answers about causality, assess all provided options meticulously before choosing the most suitable one.
(3) Please thoroughly analyze the given situation while considering causal relationships. Carefully examine the order in which the events occur, detect any violations of rules or policies, and grasp the combined effect of multiple actions that could be taking place concurrently, including both the actions performed and not performed. Comprehend the role of logical operators to understand causality accurately. Refrain from assuming a causal link unless clearly stated. Consider the implications of both direct and indirect actions and their possible consequences. Acknowledge that actions of omission can have equally consequential effects as actions of commission. Recognize that multiple simultaneous actions can all contribute to a final outcome and each individual action can be a cause in itself. Understand conditions and actions that have equal chances of causing an event and carefully evaluate all the provided choices before making an informed decision about causal attribution. Remember that intentional actions imply a different level of causality compared to unintentional actions. Irrespective of the number of causal actions, each has its share of responsibility.
(4) Thoroughly analyze the situation, paying particular emphasis to causal relationships. Examine the sequence of events and identify any breaches of rules or policies. Understand the compounded effect of multiple actions both performed and not performed, rendering all possibilities. Ensure accurate comprehension of logical operators to properly unravel causality, without prematurely assuming a causal link unless explicitly stated. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, considering their separate and joint implications. Recognize the impact of omission, which can have equally significant consequences as active commission. Consider that several concurrent actions might contribute to a single outcome and that these individual actions may independently be a cause. Be observant of conditions and actions with equal chances of resulting in an event but differentiate between those that are inherent characteristics (necessary conditions) versus the unusual or unexpected actions (real causes). Evaluate all choices thoroughly before deciding on causal attribution. Understand the distinctly different levels of causality between intentional and unintentional actions, without extending equal blame to both. Be cautious about over-generalizing or attributing causation incorrectly by evaluating the rule, typical behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies. Acknowledge that irrespective of the number of causes, each carries its own degree of responsibility in the outcome.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

response:
<START>
Thoroughly analyze the scenario provided, ensuring a focused understanding of causal relationships. Examine the order of events and pinpoint actions that break any rules or policies. Comprehend the combined effect of various actions taken or not taken, contemplating all possibilities. Decode logical operators accurately so as to unravel cause and effect relationships without making premature assumptions of causality unless explicitly mentioned. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, taking into account their individual and combined effects. Acknowledge the significance of an action not taken (omission), considering it might have a comparable effect as a taken action (commission). Understand that various simultaneous actions might each contribute to an overall outcome, with individual actions potentially being independent causes. Be watchful of conditions and actions that equally have the capability of resulting in an event, differentiating between actions that are inherently necessary and other actions that are causes in and of themselves due to their unusual or unexpected nature. Examine each choice rigorously before assigning causal attribution. Understand the different measures of causality between intentional and accidental actions, without attributing equal blame to both. Exercise caution against adulterating causality or tagging incorrect attributions by considering the standard behaviors, exceptions, and outliers. Recognize that regardless of the number of causes involved, each carries its distinct level of responsibility in the outcome. For any actions taken, focus on understanding the intention behind the action as well as determining its effects in order to accurately answer questions about intentionality and causality. Remember to answer from the given options, bracketing your answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Given the detailed information, your job is to precisely analyze and decipher possible causal relations and unfolding events, paying special attention to their chronological sequences and any violated rules or policies. Identify the separate outcomes of multiple concurrent actions, rather than perceiving them collectively. Be adept at interpreting logical connectors like 'either...or' and understand that each action within such a structure can independently lead to a result. Refrain from assuming causality without explicit indications but be willing to examine previous events and policy violations as potential causative elements. When potential harmful effects are knowingly ignored, identify this as a tacit acknowledgment of causality. Strive to understand the true intentions behind each action, especially when faced with ethical dilemmas or scenarios with multiple plausible effects - both intended and unintended. Use prudent human judgment to separate intentional actions from unintentional repercussions. This nuanced comprehension of intentions and effects will prove beneficial when attributing causality. Recognize that causality isn't invariably explicit and in such scenarios, rely on contextual cues, inferred intentions, and likely consequences for a reasoned judgment. Encourage critical thinking, and refrain from attributing unnecessary causality, particularly when all conditions necessary for an event to occur were already met before an action. Do not infer causality where none is explicitly required or indicated, as in 'either...or' situations. Analyze and scrutinize prior conditions and actions independently before hastily attributing them to an outcome.

   prompt: Based on provided details, your mission is to accurately decipher and analyze possible causal relationships and event sequences, being attentive to chronological orders and breaches of rules or policies if any. Emphasis should be on understanding the distinct outcomes of separate actions, even when they occur simultaneously, instead of grouping them as a collective event. Hone your skills in accurately analyzing logical links such as 'either...or' structures and realize that every action within such structures can each lead to an independent result. Avoid jumping to conclusions about causality in the absence of explicit evidence but remain open to considering past events and policy infringements as potential causative elements. When harmful effects are knowingly overlooked, interpret this as implicit causality. Endeavor to understand the core intentions behind each action, specifically in case of ethical quandaries or situations with multiple potential effects - intentional or otherwise. Employ sound human judgment to discern deliberate actions from unintended consequences. This nuanced understanding helps in accurate causality attribution. However, remember that causality may not always be explicitly evident. In such situations, rely on contextual clues, inferred purpose, and plausible effects for a reasoned analysis. Exercise critical thinking and avoid attributing unnecessary causality, especially when all necessary prerequisites for an event were fulfilled prior to a particular action. Avoid inferring causality in 'either...or' scenarios unless explicitly required. Do not rush to link prior conditions and actions to outcomes prematurely- scrutinize them independently first. Finally, choose an answer from the given options to answer causality questions accurately. This task invites you to emulate the intricate decision-making process typical of human observers while understanding causality.

Offer undivided attention to abnormal and outlier events differing from the norm, scrutinizing situations in isolation, without always linking them together. Grasp the entire context of the situation, refraining from assumptions based solely on independent events. It's paramount to not confuse correlation with causation, ensuring that a typical causal relationship isn't assumed simply because two events co-occur. Acknowledge the complexity of attributing causation when there are multiple, simultaneous causes. It's significant to separate causation from intention when assessing a scenario, assigning intention based on the explicit and implied goals of the individuals involved, not merely on the results of their actions. Utilize this understanding to accurately respond to the forthcoming questions on causal attribution, showcasing understanding of these principles.

   prompt: When analyzing situations for causal attribution, adopt a comprehensive approach, taking into account all factors and events. Recognize that an outcome can be the result of various simultaneous actions. Understand that a change in any single factor does not automatically establish causation. Evaluate the probability of outcomes being pre-set or influenced by the changes implemented. Be mindful of unexpected occurrences and atypical situations, considering that a sequence of actions can lead to a specific outcome. Resist the inclination to hastily assign causation based on the first factors introduced, and avoid initial impression bias. Remember that causation can involve multiple steps or actions, and a single event should not be thought of as the only direct cause. Recognize the potential for multiple causes to act together, leading to the outcome. Balance the effects of changed, maintained, and newly introduced variables, and do not disproportionately assign causative significance. Consider the initial state, understanding the relevance of 'unchanged' or 'passive' variables. Particularly attentive to situations with simultaneous or alternative causes, where more than one cause could independently drive the same effect. Examine whether a cause was merely sufficient in the presence of other potential causes, or if it was a necessary requirement for an effect to occur. Utilize these insights to provide a nuanced response to the following questions about causal attribution, identifying both the direct and indirect causes.

A change in a single component does not inherently determine causation. Assess the probability of outcomes being predetermined or influenced by certain changes. Be particularly mindful of unexpected events or those deviating from usual norms, understanding that a sequence of progressive actions can lead to a final outcome. Be wary of initial bias, preventing hasty causation assignment solely based on the initial elements introduced. Grasp that causation typically involves a series of steps or actions; therefore, no single event should be given full priority as the direct cause. Recognize that an event can have a mix of causes working in tandem to yield an outcome, involving both direct and indirect causes. A direct cause is an event that immediately prompts or produces an outcome, while indirect causes play a role in producing the direct cause or setting up conditions for an event. Avoid overemphasizing on just the direct cause and neglecting the stages leading up to it. Utilize this broadened understanding of complex causation, along with the multi-layered nature of cause and effect, to provide detailed and thoughtful responses to the following questions about causal attribution where both direct and indirect causes are identified.

   prompt: In your analysis of causality, consider each situation in a comprehensive manner, examining all potentially relevant factors and events. Understand that the ultimate outcome could result from one or several simultaneous actions, where the changing of an individual factor might not always imply causation. Scrutinize careully to determine whether outcomes are predestined or influenced by given changes. Single out unexpected events or scenarios differing from normality, bearing in mind that a series of actions might lead to an outcome. Be alert about initial impression bias and refrain from quickly attributing causation simply based on the introduction of initial factors. Furthermore, remember that causation typically involves various steps or simultaneous actions, meaning that one singular event should not necessarily be viewed as the sole direct cause. An event could indeed have multiple causes which together lead to the outcome. Pay close attention to the language of the question and take into account the specific wording and conditions presented in the query. In cases of multiple causation, consider each individual factor's capacity for generating the outcome. Improve your understanding of key concepts like 'intention' and 'essential conditions,' from a wide semantic perspective. Utilize this understanding to provide detailed responses to the following questions about causal attribution, where both direct and indirect causes are discerned.

   prompt: Carefully analyze various scenarios to assign accurate causal attribution. Factor in all relevant elements, be they incidents or entities, appreciating that causation can be a result of several actions transpiring at once. Recognize that changes in factors don't always lead to causation. Be diligent when sifting through whether results were pre-determined or remained immune to particular changes. Pay heightened attention to atypical events and outliers that break from convention, assessing these cases singularly and not categorically viewing them as interdependent. Understand the broader context, without jumping to conclusions based solely on individual occurrences. Remember that it's crucial to differentiate correlation from causation to not hastily infer a causal relationship just because two events happened concomitantly. Deal with the intricacy of assigning causation when confronted with multiple, concurrent causes. Understand that inaction may also lead to causation and cannot be dismissed in the analysis. Also, understand the role decisions play in setting up causal circumstances. Be keen to examine scenarios involving numerous simultaneous causes. Strive to distinguish causation from intention, allocating intention based on explicit and implicit goals of the individuals involved, rather than solely on their actions' outcomes. Use your comprehension of these principles to precisely respond to the questions on causal attribution that follow. Keep in mind that causation involves understanding the intersecting influences of objects/people, actions, or lack thereof, and decisions. Every variable in a situation must be considered before making a causal claim.

   prompt: Systematically analyze scenarios to accurately derive causal attribution. Consider each individual factor and event comprehensively, recognizing that causation can be a product of multiple actions operating simultaneously, and a change in variables does not automatically infer causation. Grasp the importance of necessary and sufficient conditions, distinguishing between both while ascribing causation. When a condition is necessary, an outcome can't occur without it. When a condition is sufficient, it guarantees the outcome. Understand that predetermined elements or unaffected attributes by a specified change may also contribute to the outcome. Offer unwavering focus to irregular and divergent events deviating from standard patterns, examining situations independently without creating unnecessary linkages. Thoroughly understand the entire context of the situation, restraining from assuming causality based solely on independent events. Be aware that correlation does not equate to causation and a typical causal relationship should not be presumed merely because two events happen concurrently. Reconnoiter the complexity of directing causation when there are multiple simultaneous causes. Distinguish between causation and intention when evaluating a situation, ascribing intentionality based on explicit and implied objectives, not merely based on the outcomes of actions. Carefully consider the initial conditions before any changes have been implemented, keeping in mind that not every change or action directly influences the final outcome. Apply this understanding to accurately respond to the following questions on causal attribution, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of these principles.

   prompt: Please thoroughly analyze the given situation while considering causal relationships. Carefully examine the order in which the events occur, detect any violations of rules or policies, and grasp the combined effect of multiple actions that could be taking place concurrently, including both the actions performed and not performed. Comprehend the role of logical operators to understand causality accurately. Refrain from assuming a causal link unless clearly stated. Consider the implications of both direct and indirect actions and their possible consequences. Acknowledge that actions of omission can have equally consequential effects as actions of commission. Recognize that multiple simultaneous actions can all contribute to a final outcome and each individual action can be a cause in itself. Understand conditions and actions that have equal chances of causing an event and carefully evaluate all the provided choices before making an informed decision about causal attribution. Remember that intentional actions imply a different level of causality compared to unintentional actions. Irrespective of the number of causal actions, each has its share of responsibility.

   prompt: In the ensuing scenario, carefully evaluate all events and actions concerning causality. Pay heed to the order of events and take into consideration the cumulative effect of multiple simultaneous actions, including action or inactions. Be meticulous in interpreting logical operators to fully comprehend causality. If rules or policies have been disregarded, make sure to identify this. Abstain from infering causality unless a direct cause-and-effect relationship is explicitly described in the information. Beyond this, reflect upon consequences, both obvious and implicit and possibly indirectly linked. Look for markers of intent and regard the action's ethical implication that might influence the outcomes. Understand the context by estimating the timing and interconnections of events within the broader narrative. Review all suggested answers diligently, reflecting on everyone's potential impact on the final event before selecting the most logical option.

   prompt: Please perform a comprehensive analysis of the given situation by considering causal relationships and their intricate nature. Carefully assess the sequence in which the events occur, flag any breaches of rules or policies, and understand the collective effect of multiple simultaneous actions, including both the executed and non-executed actions. Use logical operators to draw conclusions on causality accurately. Do not infer causality if it is not explicitly stated. Account for both direct and indirect actions, their potential implications and consequences. Recognize that omitting certain actions can result in consequential effects comparable to those from performed actions. Acknowledge that multiple concurrent actions can contribute to a final outcome, and each initiative can be a cause. When evaluating outcomes, consider the redundancy in actions and the existence of conditions that are already sufficient for the event to occur or that have equal chances of triggering an event. Make sure to differentiate between necessary and sufficient conditions when establishing causal relationships. Evaluate if an action has any additional impact in the already unfolding scenario. Understand order and concurrency of events and their impact on causality. Remember, any implied action could carry different levels of causality and even intentional actions alone wouldn't constitute causality especially if there are other pre-existing conditions. No matter how many actions contribute to an event, each shares its proportion of responsibility. Proceed to make a well-informed decision about causal attribution by meticulously evaluating all provided options.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the situation, paying particular emphasis to causal relationships. Examine the sequence of events and identify any breaches of rules or policies. Understand the compounded effect of multiple actions both performed and not performed, rendering all possibilities. Ensure accurate comprehension of logical operators to properly unravel causality, without prematurely assuming a causal link unless explicitly stated. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, considering their separate and joint implications. Recognize the impact of omission, which can have equally significant consequences as active commission. Consider that several concurrent actions might contribute to a single outcome and that these individual actions may independently be a cause. Be observant of conditions and actions with equal chances of resulting in an event but differentiate between those that are inherent characteristics (necessary conditions) versus the unusual or unexpected actions (real causes). Evaluate all choices thoroughly before deciding on causal attribution. Understand the distinctly different levels of causality between intentional and unintentional actions, without extending equal blame to both. Be cautious about over-generalizing or attributing causation incorrectly by evaluating the rule, typical behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies. Acknowledge that irrespective of the number of causes, each carries its own degree of responsibility in the outcome.

   prompt: Please deeply dive into the given situation and focus on the causal relationships. Keep in mind the sequence in which events take place, notice any violations of rules or regulations, and thoroughly comprehend the compounded impact of multiple simultaneous actions, including both actual and hypothetical actions. Understand the role of logical operators in causality and avoid making assumptions about links without explicit mention. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions and their potential outcomes while acknowledging that actions, whether committed or omitted, can both have significant effects. Recognize that each action in a sequence can contribute to the final result and can independently be seen as a cause. Evaluate actions having the same likelihood of causing an event while choosing an option for causal attribution, and thoroughly assess every choice before making an informed decision. Understand the different levels of causation applicable to intentional and unintentional actions. Keep in mind that regardless of the number of causes, each cause shares its part of the responsibility. Additionally, strongly consider whether the contributing components are simply necessary conditions, entirely sufficient conditions, or both for the outcome. Ensure you consider causality at both individual and aggregate levels, without overlooking the interaction and mutual influence between multiple concurrent actions. Finally, do not oversimplify the situation and always consider eventualities even for the most straightforward scenarios.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the situation, placing a particular emphasis on understanding causal relationships. Examine the sequence of events and identify any breaches of rules or policies. Factor in the cumulative effect of multiple actions, both those carried out and those omitted, thus accounting for all possibilities. Decode causality accurately by ensuring proper comprehension of logical operators, abstaining from assuming a casual link unless it is explicitly expressed. Separate direct actions from indirect ones, contemplating their individual and combined ramifications. Acknowledge the significance of actions omitted as they can bear as profound an impact as active actions. Understand that numerous simultaneous actions could account for one outcome, with each individual action potentially being a cause in and of itself. Keep abreast of situations and actions with equal probabilities of precipitating an event but differentiate between inherent conditions (necessary conditions) and the atypical or unexpected actions (actual causes). Prior to making a decision on causal attribution, meticulously appraise every choice on the table. Scrutinize the diverse levels of causality between intentional and unintentional actions, be well aware that not all actions deserve equal blame. Be wary of the mistake of over-generalization or incorrect attributions of causation by analyzing conventional behaviors, exceptions, and anomalies under the given rule. Remember that regardless of the number of causes, each bears its own measure of responsibility for the subsequent result. Above all, when considering causality and attribution, pay close attention to the stated intentions of actors and compare them against the outcomes that transpired; weigh against whether the harm caused was actively sought or unintentionally inflicted due to other actions. Prioritize explicit intentions over ultimate outcomes to accurately determine causal attribution.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the scenario provided, ensuring a focused understanding of causal relationships. Examine the order of events and pinpoint actions that break any rules or policies. Comprehend the combined effect of various actions taken or not taken, contemplating all possibilities. Decode logical operators accurately so as to unravel cause and effect relationships without making premature assumptions of causality unless explicitly mentioned. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, taking into account their individual and combined effects. Acknowledge the significance of an action not taken (omission), considering it might have a comparable effect as a taken action (commission). Understand that various simultaneous actions might each contribute to an overall outcome, with individual actions potentially being independent causes. Be watchful of conditions and actions that equally have the capability of resulting in an event, differentiating between actions that are inherently necessary and other actions that are causes in and of themselves due to their unusual or unexpected nature. Examine each choice rigorously before assigning causal attribution. Understand the different measures of causality between intentional and accidental actions, without attributing equal blame to both. Exercise caution against adulterating causality or tagging incorrect attributions by considering the standard behaviors, exceptions, and outliers. Recognize that regardless of the number of causes involved, each carries its distinct level of responsibility in the outcome. For any actions taken, focus on understanding the intention behind the action as well as determining its effects in order to accurately answer questions about intentionality and causality.
