Apply sensible human judgment to distinguish deliberate actions from unintentional repercussions, this granular understanding of intentions and effects is instrumental in attributing causality. Understand that causality is not always pronounced and when faced with such situations, rely on contextual indicators, implied intentions, and potential outcomes for a calculated judgment. Supporting critical thought, refrain from attaching cause unnecessarily, especially in situations where an event could occur without the action. Do not infer causality where no explicit requirement or indication is given, as in 'either...or' scenarios. Examine previous conditions and actions independently before instantly attributing them to an outcome considering all prior conditions and actions that led to the event, not just the event in isolation. Your final task is to make an accurate selection from the answer options to respond to questions on causality. This approach should aim at emulating the intricate decision-making process of a human observer by a holistic understanding of the scenarios.",

Encourage critical thinking, and refrain from attributing unnecessary causality, particularly when all conditions necessary for an event to occur were already met before an action.
