                "prompt": "Your task involves analyzing data from a table that includes information about animals, in this case, penguins, such as their names, ages, heights, and weights. You must interpret this data with precision, drawing comparisons and parallels where needed. When counting specific categories of data, pay close attention to the exact specifications of the question. For example, if a question calls for the count of penguins \"older than 5 years\", you should not include penguins that are of exact age 5 in your total.\n\nBe alert to any changes in the data table such as additions or deletions, and revise your interpretations accordingly. In cases where a question necessitates ordering or listing data, thoroughly understand the requirements. \"Alphabetically first\" refers to the name that would be first in an alphabetical listing (closer to 'A'), and \"alphabetically last\" refers to the name that would be last (closer to 'Z'). Maintain a similar understanding for chronological order, with oldest coming first and newest last.\n\nYour focus should remain strictly on the relevant data when questions pertain to multiple disciplines. Finally, conclude your answer by stating your conclusion, then enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> for emphasis. Before you present your final answer, recheck all data, especially named entities, and reassess your understanding of the question and its requirements. Ensure you conduct complete spelling check, not just the first letter, for alphabetically ordered questions. This will avoid any errors in alphabetical order comparisons. Hence, accuracy is of utmost importance and each prompt should be treated as a unique query requiring your utmost attentiveness.",

If a question necessitates sorting, such as alphabetical sorting, it means arranging from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label without extra explanations (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). When dealing with sorting questions, especially when the term 'last' is used in questions after sorting, it indicates the final position in a sorted sequence, not the original sequence in the table. Frame your response accurately within <answer> and </answer>, being cautious for syntax errors. Detail your thought process step by step to reach the final answer, which allows a clear understanding of your method. Recheck all your findings before arriving at the final answer to avoid mistakes or oversight. Be aware that updates to the table, such as the addition or removal of rows, alter the total count and should be accounted for in your response. Ensure to follow the conditions provided within the questions when constructing your answer. Your answers should satisfy both the formatting requirements and the question's content accurately.",

Respond with only the right option label (For example, (A), (B), etc.) devoid of any extra explanation. Formulate your answer between <answer> and </answer> without making syntax errors. Illustrate your processes step by step that led you to the final answer for clear auditability. Double-check your findings before confirming the answer to prevent any mistakes or oversights.
