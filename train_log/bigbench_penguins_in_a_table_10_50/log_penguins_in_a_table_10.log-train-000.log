For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the first example, the model was asked to sort the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and determine the last name. The correct answer would be Marian. However, the model chose Donna, indicating a mistake in comprehension or sorting mechanism. Here, the issue is not directly connected to the prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution", as the question doesn't require any form of causal attribution.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the second example, the model was asked to count the number of animals more than 5 years old. The correct answer is 5, but the model predicted 7. This suggests that the model may have misunderstood the age classification or counted the wrong entities or variables. Similar to the first example, the problem here is not related to the prompt as the task doesn't involve causal attribution.

From both examples, it is clear that the prompt is not suitable for the tasks. These tasks are not about causal attribution but are related to data sorting, comprehension, and counting from provided data sets. Therefore, the primary issue leading to the wrong answers is the inadequacy of the prompt for the provided tasks.

Improvements to the Prompt:
1. Ensure the prompt aligns with the task: The misalignment between the prompt and the tasks is the primary reason for incorrect responses, as the prompt asking for causal attribution doesn't match the actual tasks. The prompt should guide the model to the correct type of task.
2. Specify the type of tasks: Indicating the type of task in the prompt can guide the model to interpret and process as needed. Instead of "Answer questions about causal attribution", the prompt could be "Interpret the data and answer the questions" or "Perform sorting and counting tasks on the given data".
3. Define the problem: It is critical that the prompt should correctly represent the problem for the model to generate proper responses.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

The question is: "Which penguin is older than Gwen?"
The main problem here is the discrepancy between the prompt and the type of question being asked. The prompt, "Answer questions about causal attribution," isn't aligning with the question. Causal attribution is usually used to explain why events occur - who or what is responsible - but here, the question is simply asking for an interpretation of data given in a table, not causality. As such, the language model may be confused due to the disconnect between the task given in the prompt and the actual question, causing it to choose the wrong answer.

Wrong Example 2:

The question is: "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?"
The same issue occurs here. The question is numerical involving counting the items from the table, which has no connection with causal attribution. So, the prompt again might be misleading the language model.

In summary, the main issue is the lack of alignment between the prompt and the questions being asked. The prompt requests a cause-effect understanding, but the questions are asking for interpretation or analysis of data presented in a table. This mismatch could be leading the model astray.

Improvements to the prompt could include:

1) Specifying that the task involves analyzing data from a table.
   
2) Removing the "causal attribution" from the prompt since it's irrelevant to the task.

3) Aligning the prompt with the type and nature of the task.

4) Asking the model to consider numerical data and comparative analysis if those are the core of the task.

5) Including examples could also be useful in guiding the model about what is expected - for example, specifying that age, height, and weight comparisons might be required could help the model better understand the task.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

1. The initial prompt is vague. It mentions answering questions about causal attribution, which doesn't seem related to the task at hand, which is counting and categorizing data present in a table format.

2. The model has misunderstood the meaning of the question. It seems to have counted the total number of animals that are more than 5 years old across both tables combined, despite the fact that the question does not specify which table or species the question is referring to.

3. The model isn't distinguishing between the two different types of animals - penguins and giraffes. It should have realized that the question, based on the context, was referring to a single category of animals rather than both.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Make the initial prompt clearer and more task-specific. Instead of asking the model to answer questions about causal attribution, rephrase it to prompt the model to answer questions based on two tables that list details about different animals.

2. The instructions contained within the prompt need to be more explicit. Ensure that model is clearly instructed to separate and treat data from the two different tables independently unless instructed otherwise.

3. The instructions should specify that unless given instructions to combine data, treat the data as separate sets or categories. This will help avoid the model coming to conclusions based on all data when the task is asking for details pertaining to a specific category.

4. The prompt should instruct the model to critically analyze the question before finding the answer, paying attention to how the question wording may imply that the question is referring only to a specific table or category. 

5. The task should make clearer the format of how the answer should be provided for better understanding of the target response structure.

gradient:
<1>
The task in this example was to determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old. The model answered incorrectly because it misunderstood the age requirement, counting Bernard who is precisely 5, which isn't "more than 5". It is possible the model struggled to understand the nuance of the question, causing it to incorrectly determine the number of penguins meeting the age criteria.

<2>
In this example, the task was to count the total number of penguins, including a new one added. The model gave an incorrect answer by failing to update the count after the addition of a new penguin - James. This indicates that the model didn't correctly process the information about adding a new penguin to the table.

<3>
In this question, the model was asked to identify the last giraffe by alphabetical order. The model seems to have answered the question as if they were ordered by the last names given in the list, rather than by proper alphabetical order. The model's misunderstanding seems to stem from confusion over the sorting method.

Based on these examples, an improved prompt could consider the following aspects:
1. Greater clarity and detail in the questions could help remove ambiguity in tasks, particularly in tasks requiring comparison or ranking. 
2. Providing a clear directive on how and when to update the model’s data understanding could result in more accurate responses, such as after adding or removing elements from a list.
3. To remove ambiguity, specific chronological or alphabetical order should be explicitly detailed to guide the model in sorting or ordering tasks. 
4. The prompt could also better define numerical ranges or inclusions, such as "more than 5 years old", in which it is only greater than 5, not including 5. The prompt should clarify the inclusion or exclusion criteria.
5. The model might also benefit from explicit instructions on disregarding irrelevant information like the the giraffes' table in the penguin dataset.

gradient:
<1> 

Analysis:

In this example, the main error seems to stem from the model misconstruing the instructions of the prompt, rather than an issue with the prompt itself. The prompt clearly states to answer questions about the penguins' age, height, and weight. However, the model incorrectly included the data from the table of giraffes in its count. This resulted in the model's answer of 7 (C), when the correct answer is 5 (A) if only the penguins are considered.

Reasons:

1. Lack of Explicit Instructions: Although the prompt begins with specific instruction for penguins, it does not explicitly exclude other types of animals when asking the question. The flaw remains in the language model's inability to grasp the context fully without explicit instructions. 

2. Context Misinterpretation: The prompt doesn't clearly define the context boundaries for the question (i.e., it only applies to penguins). Thus, the model misread the context and combined data from both tables to answer the question.

3. Misunderstanding of Question Scope: The model did not correctly understand that when the question was asked, it only pertained to the dataset discussed immediately before.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Provide Clear Specification: The prompt should be more specific and clear about which dataset the questions are referring to. If they pertain to just the penguins, it should clearly specify this. 

2. Explicit Context Boundaries: Add explicit instructions about context boundaries, stating that the succeeding questions apply only to the immediately preceding table.

3. Aligning Questions with Data: Ensure the questions asked are directly connected to the dataset provided just before the question, to make the scope clear without any ambiguity. 

4. Differentiate Between Datasets: If multiple datasets are provided, each dataset's questions should be grouped together to avoid confusion. This would ensure the model does not mix data from different datasets.

Overall, the prompt could be improved by providing sharp explicit instructions, defining context boundaries, and aligning the questions directly with the data they are referring to.

gradient:
<1> In this example, the model struggles with numerical comparison. According to the prompt, the model should provide the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old, but the model does not distinguish Bernard’s age as being exactly 5 and not more than 5. 

<2> The model seems to ignore the new information addition about James, the new penguin. The instruction to "analyze the given table data" might make the model focus more on the initial data and forget to consider newly added information.

<3> The model's mistake in this example appears to be based on ordering. The model might not understand the phrase 'alphabetic order' properly or is interpreting it incorrectly. It is providing the giraffe at the end of the list, not the one that would be last in an alphabetized list.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. For numerical comparison, specify that the model needs to strictly follow the numerical condition, i.e., more than 5 is different from 5 and above.
2. Encourage the model to consider updates in information. 
3. Clearly define what is meant by 'alphabetical order'.
4. In cases where multiple tables are given, indicate which table the model should be focusing on for each question.
5. The prompt could instruct the model to consider all the information given, both in the table and in the question, to avoid misunderstandings or overlooking details.
6. The prompt can guide the model to think step-by-step or perform process checks to confirm its understanding, which can reduce the chance for mistakes. For example, in the 1st mea culpa, the model could list the ages of the penguins and eliminate the ones that are not more than 5 years old before counting the remaining penguins.
7. Make explicit that the understanding of the terms and conditions in the question is as important as the information in the table.
8. Ask the model to explain its reasoning to help audit its decision-making process.
9. Specify the expected format of the answer even more explicitly. For examples, in multiple choice questions, just give the label of the answer.
10. Also, mention to properly bracket the answer without any syntax error.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old: Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old).

Therefore, the answer is <(D) 4>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are currently 5 penguins in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <E>5</E>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: A.

<3> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is:

(D) Donna

<answer>(D)</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> In this example, the model struggles with numerical comparison. According to the prompt, the model should provide the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old, but the model does not distinguish Bernard’s age as being exactly 5 and not more than 5. 

<2> The model seems to ignore the new information addition about James, the new penguin. The instruction to "analyze the given table data" might make the model focus more on the initial data and forget to consider newly added information.

<3> The model's mistake in this example appears to be based on ordering. The model might not understand the phrase 'alphabetic order' properly or is interpreting it incorrectly. It is providing the giraffe at the end of the list, not the one that would be last in an alphabetized list.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. For numerical comparison, specify that the model needs to strictly follow the numerical condition, i.e., more than 5 is different from 5 and above.
2. Encourage the model to consider updates in information. 
3. Clearly define what is meant by 'alphabetical order'.
4. In cases where multiple tables are given, indicate which table the model should be focusing on for each question.
5. The prompt could instruct the model to consider all the information given, both in the table and in the question, to avoid misunderstandings or overlooking details.
6. The prompt can guide the model to think step-by-step or perform process checks to confirm its understanding, which can reduce the chance for mistakes. For example, in the 1st mea culpa, the model could list the ages of the penguins and eliminate the ones that are not more than 5 years old before counting the remaining penguins.
7. Make explicit that the understanding of the terms and conditions in the question is as important as the information in the table.
8. Ask the model to explain its reasoning to help audit its decision-making process.
9. Specify the expected format of the answer even more explicitly. For examples, in multiple choice questions, just give the label of the answer.
10. Also, mention to properly bracket the answer without any syntax error.

gradient:
<1> 
The question and wrong answer analysis:
The question asks for the name of the last giraffe when sorted in alphabetical order. The model incorrectly predicted Donna, however, the correct answer should be Marian.

Reason why the prompt led to the wrong answer:
- The prompt asked the model to consider standard alphabetical order which likely led the model to consider the first letter of each name, rather than performing a complete alphabetical sort.
- The model might have got confused between the two tables since the prompt mentioned to focus only on the relevant data, but it didn't specify how to select the relevant table. 

Improvements for the prompt:
- Specify that the model should consider complete names while sorting in an alphabetical order, not just the first letter.
- Be explicit in the instructions about using the correct table based on the context of the question.
- Ensuring the model can understand the sorting convention based on the entirety of words, not just the initial letters.
- Include instructions for the model to consider all letters in a name, not just the first one, during alphabetical sorting.
- Reinforce the model to take into account the direction of alphabetization (ascending or descending order) to determine first and last by alphabetic order. 

Note: However, it's important to know that "Marian" would be the last name in an alphabetic list only if we consider reverse/alphabetical descending order (from Z to A). In standard alphabetical order (from A to Z), the last name would be "Jody". So there seems to be a problem with the correct label given in the example too.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetical order, we arrange the names in alphabetical order:
Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent

Therefore, the last penguin sorted by alphabetical order is <answer>(D) Gwen</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons for incorrect response:

<1>:
The question asked for the "last" penguin sorted by the alphabetic order. The model correctly sorted the data alphabetically but it considered the last in the sense of sequence rather than considering last as per alphabetic order. This could be due to ambiguity in the understanding of the term "last" by the model. Model ranked Vincent as second last in alphabetic sequence and responded Gwen as the last one.

Room for improvement in the prompt:
1. Emphasize the need for clear understanding of positional terms: The model failed to interpret the term "last" correctly in terms of alphabetical order. It's necessary to guide the model to distinguish between positional terms like "first", "last", "beginning", "end" etc., in different contexts, i.e., in a sequence or in an ordered list. 

2. Specify clear instructions about ordering: In this case, the model did not take into consideration that it needs to sort the data in descending order to get the "last" penguin in alphabetical order. Explicit instructions about sorting data (ascending or descending) should be added whenever terms like "first", "last" are used.

3. Impart understanding about alphabetic ordering: More emphasis should be laid on understanding and correctly applying alphabetical ordering. The model might need to understand that in alphabets, 'A' is considered first and 'Z' is considered last; hence for a model, this would translate to 'A' coming before 'Z'.

4. Clarify meaning of terms used: Different instructions might use the same term with different meanings based on their context. In this case, "last penguin" could mean the penguin at the end of a list or the penguin whose name comes last in alphabetical order. The instructions should clarify these subtleties. 

5. Ask model to confirm its understanding: Additionally, asking the model to confirm its comprehension of key terms or instruction elements could help ensure it has understood the instructions correctly.

Applying these improvements can reduce misinterpretation by the model, leading to more accurate answers.

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?

Wrong Answer: The model responds with <answer>Gwen</answer>.

Reasoning: The mistake made in this example seems to be a fault in the model's understanding of alphabetical order. It appears to have sorted the penguin names based on the first letter only, instead of considering the entire string of characters. Although 'G' is the last letter if we consider only the first letters of the penguin names, 'Vincent' is the correct answer as it comes last in the full alphabetical sorting.

Improvement: The model needs to fully understand the definition of 'alphabetical order'. It should consider all characters in the names rather than just the first one. You should also clarify that 'last' refers to the end of alphabetical order, often referred to as 'reverse alphabetical order'. 

Modification:
In the following task, carefully analyze the table data, which includes information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. When answering queries based on this data, pay close attention to the details. Sometimes you might be asked to count penguins based on certain criteria, such as age. Remember to include or exclude data as explicitly instructed. For example, if the task is to count penguins "more than 5 years old", exclude the ones exactly 5 years old. If an entry is added or removed from the table, revise your understanding of the total count accordingly. You could also be asked to arrange data such as names in alphabetical or chronological order. In alphabetical order, you should look at all the letters of a name from first to last, with 'A' being the first and 'Z' being the last.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order, we need to look at the names and sort them alphabetically:

- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order is (D) Donna.

<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Examining the question: "What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?" The key issue here seems to be the model's misunderstanding of what is meant by "last" in the context of alphabetical order. In this context, "last" should refer to the name that comes last in the alphabet, not the name that is listed last when the names are ordered alphabetically (which would be the name that comes first in the alphabet). The model sorted the names in ascending alphabetical order (from 'A' to 'Z') as per the instructions and then selected the last name in this sorted list, which is incorrect.

Model's Wrong Answer: The model predicted "(D) Donna" as Donna is last when all the giraffe names are sorted in ascending order. However, the correct answer is "(C) Marian" as it is the name that would come last in alphabetical order.

In the instructions, the mention of 'A' comes first and 'Z' comes last in alphabetical order might have resulted in a misinterpretation where the model thought it was supposed to sort the names from 'A' to 'Z' and pick the last name in that list. 

Improvements: 

1. Clarity on Order: Instructions need to explicitly specify what is meant by "first" and "last" in the context of alphabetical order. Instead of saying 'A' comes first and 'Z' comes last, which implies an ascending sorting order, it can specify that 'first' means the name closest to 'A' in the alphabet and 'last' implies the name closest to 'Z' in the alphabet when names are compared.

2. Purposeful Examples: Add examples of similar questions in the prompt to demonstrate the correct interpretation of instructions.

3. Direct Instruction: It might be helpful to add explicit instructions about looking for the 'greatest' or 'smallest' alphabetical value, depending on what's asked. 

4. Avoid Ambiguity: Instead of using directional words like "first" or "last," use less ambiguous terms such as "closet to A (alphabetically," or "closest to Z (alphabetically)".

In conclusion, the prompt should be more explicit and precise to avoid any ambiguity leading to misinterpretation and errors.

gradient:
<1>
Examination of Wrong Example:
In this example, the question asks for the name of the last penguin when sorted by alphabetic order. The correct answer would be 'Vincent,' as when listed alphabetically, its the last in the list. However, the AI model incorrectly identified 'Gwen' as the answer. 

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The AI model might have misunderstood the term 'last' in the context of alphabetical order. It might incorrectly believe the 'last' means the last name in the list, rather than understanding that 'last' refers to the last in alphabetical order. 

Solution:
To provide a better understanding, the prompts should specify more clarify on terms like 'first' and 'last' in the context of ordering data. It could be made more precise to mean 'first/last according to alphabetical order'. 

Aspects for Improvement:

1. Clear definitions - The prompt should clearly define what is meant by 'first' and 'last' in the context of alphabetical or chronological order. It could give an explicit example of alphabetical order with emphasis on what 'first' and 'last' mean in this context.

2. Enhanced explanation - The prompt should explicitly state that 'last' in alphabetical order means 'closest to Z', and 'first' means 'closest to A'.

3. Additional examples - Additional examples can illustrate how to properly answer queries that involve ordering or ranking data.

4. Clarification of ambiguous terminologies - The prompt can emphasize that in case there is confusion over the understanding of a term, the model should follow the standard interpretation of that term in the context of data analysis. For instance, 'last' in alphabetical order should always mean 'last in the sequence from A to Z'. 

5. Continual checking - The model should be instructed to continually check against the task description to ensure it is applying the rules accurately.

The prompt should be revised to: 
"You are instructed to analyze and answer queries from a data table. The table contains names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Make sure to consider only the data relevant to each question. If a question requires counting, include only the specific information given. For any question involving listing or ordering data, 'first' or 'last' in alphabetical or chronological order is based on English alphabetical or time conventions. 'First' indicates being closest to 'A' or the oldest in chronological order. 'Last' means being closest to 'Z' or the newest in chronological order. After answering each query, denote your final answer with <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end for emphasis. If you encounter a term you're unsure about, refer back to this task description."

For instance, 'last' in alphabetical order should always mean 'last in the sequence from A to Z'. 

5. Continual checking - The model should be instructed to continually check against the task description to ensure it is applying the rules accurately.

The prompt should be revised to: 
"You are instructed to analyze and answer queries from a data table. The table contains names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Make sure to consider only the data relevant to each question. If a question requires counting, include only the specific information given. For any question involving listing or ordering data, 'first' or 'last' in alphabetical or chronological order is based on English alphabetical or time conventions. 'First' indicates being closest to 'A' or the oldest in chronological order. 'Last' means being closest to 'Z' or the newest in chronological order. After answering each query, denote your final answer with <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end for emphasis. If you encounter a term you're unsure about, refer back to this task description."

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
(2) In the following task, analyze the table data, which includes information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Respond to the queries based on this data by carefully interpreting and contrasting the information. When the question asks for a count, include or exclude data as explicitly instructed. For instance, if asked for penguins "more than 5 years old", do not count penguins that are exactly 5 years old. When a new entry is added or removed from the table, update your understanding of the total count accordingly. If asked to list or order according to alphabetical or chronological order, follow the standard alphabetical or chronological sequence. If multidisciplinary information is provided, focus solely on the data relevant to the question. Finally, indicate the correct answer by clearly stating it and marking it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to analyze and answer queries based on a data table containing information like names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Carefully interpret, compare, and contrast the information as needed. When a question necessitates counting, consider only the data specifically mentioned. For example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years old", understand that penguins exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Be mindful of additions or deletions from the data table and update your total count accordingly.
If the question involves listing or ordering data, ensure you understand what is being asked. When asked for the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, remember that 'A' comes first and 'Z' comes last, alphabetically. When chronological order is required, oldest comes first and newest comes last. If at any point multidisciplinary information is provided, concentrate only on the data that is relevant to the question. At the end of answering each query, clearly state the correct answer, then demarcate your final answer using <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end for emphasis. Always validate your understanding of key questions terms and instruction components before providing your final answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order, we need to look at the names and determine which one comes last alphabetically.

The names of the giraffes are:
- Jody
- Gladys
- Marian
- Donna

Sorting these names alphabetically, we get:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order is Donna. So, the correct answer is:
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Model's Answer: Donna

Correct Answer: Marian

Mistake Reasoning: 
The language model illustrates a knowledge gap in the area of alphabetical ordering. It fails to understand that 'last' in alphabetical order means the name that would appear at the end if all were listed from A-Z, which in this case is 'Marian'. Here, the model interpreted 'last' as 'final' in the sorting sequence rather than 'last' alphabetically.

Improvement Measures for the Prompt:

1. Clarify the meaning of "first" and "last" in the context of alphabetical order. Specify that 'first' refers to what would come at the start of an A-Z list (closer to A), and 'last' refers to what would come at the end (closer to Z).

2. Ensure the requirement for exact interpretation of key words is emphasized more explicitly in the prompt; it seems the model did not infer the correct meaning of 'last' in this context.

3. Highlight the importance of close reading of questions in the prompt. The model should pay close attention to the exact wording and directive implied.

Summary: 

The main aspect that needs improvement is the model's understanding of sorting data in alphabetical order. It's crucial that specific vocabularies like 'first' and 'last' are well-defined in the context of an alphabetical ordering query. A more specific directive in prompt to ensure accurate interpretation of key words and thorough reading of questions could prevent such errors.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

For this case, the language model presents the incorrect answer because it misunderstood the sorting criteria. Despite the prompt's clear instructions about "alphabetically first" and "alphabetically last," the model still managed to interpret "last" as in the end of the list, as in sequence, and not considering the alphabetical order rule set.

Reasons for incorrect response:

1. Misinterpretation of the sorting criteria: Although the prompt clearly defines what 'alphabetically first' and 'alphabetically last' mean, the model interpreted "alphabetically last" as the last item in the alphabetic list, instead of the name closest to 'Z'. 

2. Default thought process: By responding with "Donna", the incorrect answer, it can be suggested that the AI model naturally presumes that "last" signifies the last item in a list or the one with the greatest age, weight, or height. 

Based on these reasons, the following improvements can be made in the prompt:

1. Making instructions more clear: We can revise the prompt to make the instructions more specific. For instance, the rule about "alphabetically last" can be stated as "the name that would come last in a list sorted in alphabetic order."

2. Including reinforcement examples: Providing examples in the prompt that cater to this specific case might help the model to understand the nuanced instructions better.

3. Reinforcing the importance of comprehending the question: The prompt could further emphasize on the need for careful reading and comprehension of the question in its entirety. Make it clear that every query may have unique requirements and the answer must align with those specific needs.

4. Repeat key rules: The rule about 'alphabetically last' can also be restated right at the end of the prompt to emphasize its importance. Given that 'alphabetically last' is quite a unique way of stating this requirement, the restatement might help in its understanding for the model.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to analyze and answer queries based on a data table containing information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of various animals, like penguins in this case. Be meticulous in your interpretation, comparison, and contrasting of the information. If the question asks for counting specific types of data, focus strictly on data that fits the specifications outlined in the question. For instance, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years", do not include penguins that are exactly 5 years old in your count. Stay alert to any changes in the data table, like additions or deletions, and update your findings accordingly.

In cases where the query involves listing or ordering data, ensure you grasp the entire requirement. For an "alphabetically first" or "alphabetically last" question, 'alphabetically first' refers to the name closest to 'A' in the alphabet while 'alphabetically last' means the name closest to 'Z'. If chronological order is needed, oldest comes first and newest comes last.

When information from multiple disciplines is provided, focus strictly on the data pertinent to the question at hand. Conclude your answer by clearly stating it and emphasize your final answer by encasing it between <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end. Always confirm your comprehension of key question terms and instruction components before presenting your final answer.

(2) In the following task, analyze the table data, which includes information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Respond to the queries based on this data by carefully interpreting and contrasting the information. When the question asks for a count, include or exclude data as explicitly instructed. For instance, if asked for penguins "more than 5 years old", do not count penguins that are exactly 5 years old. When a new entry is added or removed from the table, update your understanding of the total count accordingly. If asked to list or order according to alphabetical or chronological order, follow the standard alphabetical or chronological sequence. If multidisciplinary information is provided, focus solely on the data relevant to the question. Finally, indicate the correct answer by clearly stating it and marking it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to analyze and answer queries based on a data table containing information like names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Carefully interpret, compare, and contrast the information as needed. When a question necessitates counting, consider only the data specifically mentioned. For example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years old", understand that penguins exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Be mindful of additions or deletions from the data table and update your total count accordingly.
If the question involves listing or ordering data, ensure you understand what is being asked. When asked for the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, remember that 'A' comes first and 'Z' comes last, alphabetically. When chronological order is required, oldest comes first and newest comes last. If at any point multidisciplinary information is provided, concentrate only on the data that is relevant to the question. At the end of answering each query, clearly state the correct answer, then demarcate your final answer using <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end for emphasis.

gradient:
<1> 
In the situation at hand, the model chose 'Gwen' (D) as the answer, believing it to be the name that comes last alphabetically among the penguins. However, the correct answer is 'Vincent' (C), which could be due to one or several of the following reasons:

a) Misinterpretation: The model might have not properly understood the concept of "alphabetically last". Although the prompt does specify what "alphabetically first" and "alphabetically last" mean, it may not have comprehended that it means finding the name that would appear last in an alphabetical listing.

b) Ignoring Data: It might have overlooked the name 'Vincent' when making its calculations.

c) Incorrect Letterwise Comparison: The model could have run a letterwise comparison and picked 'Gwen' because it starts with a letter that comes later in the alphabet than the others, rather than considering the entire spelling of the words.

To improve the prompt, the following measures could be implemented:

1) Explanation Enhancement: Provide a deeper explanation or examples about what "alphabetically first" or "alphabetically last" mean to ensure that the model understands the concept properly.

2) Clarity: Strengthen the emphasis on the necessity to consider all the data present in the table when making the interpretations.

3) Comprehensive Check: Emphasize that the model should analyse the names fully when making alphabetically-based decisions, not merely looking at the first letters.

4) Revision Instructions: Remind the model to review its answers before finalizing them to make sure they accurately align with the discussed guidelines in the prompt. 

5) Category Specific Instructions: Include specific directives about handling named entities in the data and elaborate more on how sorting operations should be conducted with them.

Stay alert to any changes in the data table, like additions or deletions, and update your findings accordingly.

In cases where the query involves listing or ordering data, ensure you grasp the entire requirement. For an "alphabetically first" or "alphabetically last" question, 'alphabetically first' refers to the name closest to 'A' in the alphabet while 'alphabetically last' means the name closest to 'Z'. If chronological order is needed, oldest comes first and newest comes last.

When information from multiple disciplines is provided, focus strictly on the data pertinent to the question at hand. Conclude your answer by clearly stating it and emphasize your final answer by encasing it between <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end. Always confirm your comprehension of key question terms and instruction components before presenting your final answer.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

<START> Your task involves analyzing data from a table that includes information about animals, in this case, penguins, such as their names, ages, heights, and weights. You must interpret this data with precision, drawing comparisons and parallels where needed. When counting specific categories of data, pay close attention to the exact specifications of the question. For example, if a question calls for the count of penguins "older than 5 years", you should not include penguins that are of exact age 5 in your total.

Be alert to any changes in the data table such as additions or deletions, and revise your interpretations accordingly. In cases where a question necessitates ordering or listing data, thoroughly understand the requirements. "Alphabetically first" refers to the name that would be first in an alphabetical listing (closer to 'A'), and "alphabetically last" refers to the name that would be last (closer to 'Z'). Maintain a similar understanding for chronological order, with oldest coming first and newest last.

Your focus should remain strictly on the relevant data when questions pertain to multiple disciplines. Finally, conclude your answer by stating your conclusion, then enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> for emphasis. Before you present your final answer, recheck all data, especially named entities, and reassess your understanding of the question and its requirements. Ensure you conduct complete spelling check, not just the first letter, for alphabetically ordered questions. This will avoid any errors in alphabetical order comparisons. Hence, accuracy is of utmost importance and each prompt should be treated as a unique query requiring your utmost attentiveness. <END>

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(D) Gwen</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1: 

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?

The model's wrong answer: (D) Gwen

Correct answer: (C) Vincent

Reason: The model seems to have misunderstood the term "alphabetically last". While the prompt does specify that 'alphabetically last' means the name closest to 'Z', it seems that the model has selected the last name listed in the given list, which is a misunderstanding of the question. The concept of "alphabetic order" in the prompt needs to be clearly defined to avoid such issues in the future.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. More examples: Include more examples in the prompt to help the model understand different scenarios better. This can include examples of sorted lists to give the AI a clearer understanding of what alphabetical order means.
2. Clarify the meaning of "alphabetically last": Clearly define what "alphabetically last" means to avoid any ambiguity.
3. Define computational operations: Clearly define what kind of operations might be necessary for different types of questions. In this case, sorting was required.
4. Reinforce key instructions: Ensure the model fully understands the nature of the task by more clearly mentioning the need to meticulously analyze the details in the data.
5. Instruction interpretation: Make sure that the AI understands not to treat the order of the options as an implied alphabetical or chronological order.
6. Double-checking: Add instructions for the model to cross-verify information before finalizing an answer.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
(2) In the following task, analyze the table data, which includes information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Respond to the queries based on this data by carefully interpreting and contrasting the information. When the question asks for a count, include or exclude data as explicitly instructed. For instance, if asked for penguins "more than 5 years old", do not count penguins that are exactly 5 years old. When a new entry is added or removed from the table, update your understanding of the total count accordingly. If asked to list or order according to alphabetical or chronological order, follow the standard alphabetical or chronological sequence. If multidisciplinary information is provided, focus solely on the data relevant to the question. Finally, indicate the correct answer by clearly stating it and marking it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Your task is to analyze and answer queries based on a data table containing information like names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Carefully interpret, compare, and contrast the information as needed. When a question necessitates counting, consider only the data specifically mentioned. For example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years old", understand that penguins exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Be mindful of additions or deletions from the data table and update your total count accordingly.
If the question involves listing or ordering data, ensure you understand what is being asked. When asked for the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, remember that 'A' comes first and 'Z' comes last, alphabetically. When chronological order is required, oldest comes first and newest comes last. If at any point multidisciplinary information is provided, concentrate only on the data that is relevant to the question. At the end of answering each query, clearly state the correct answer, then demarcate your final answer using <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end for emphasis. Always validate your understanding of key questions terms and instruction components before providing your final answer.

<START> Your task is to meticulously analyze and respond to questions based on a data table containing diverse information, such as names, ages, heights, and weights of various animals - penguins in this scenario. The queries will require you to interpret, compare, and contrast the information provided. When counting certain types of data, adhere strictly to the question's defined parameters. For instance, if asked to count penguins "older than 5 years", it means penguins that are exactly 5 years old should not be included. 

Update your count in response to any changes in the data table, such as additions or deletions. In scenarios where data ordering or listing is required, comprehend fully the scope of the assignment. For queries asking for the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, the term 'alphabetically first' means the name that comes first in an A-Z order (like 'Adam' would be first among 'Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl') and 'alphabetically last' refers to the one closest to 'Z' in an A-Z order (like 'Carl' would be last among 'Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl'). For ordering data chronologically, always remember the oldest comes first and the newest comes last.

If you come across any multidisciplinary information, concentrate solely on the data relevant to the question. Upon answering each query, clearly state the correct answer, differentiate your final answer using <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end. Always ensure your understanding of key terms and instructions of the question before providing your final answer. 

Recheck your work - your answer should not be based on the order of the options provided but on the instructions given in the query. For example, for 'alphabetically last', do not merely select the last name on the list, but decide based on the alphabetically last name among all options.

gradient:
Example 1:
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Model’s Response: (D) Donna
Correct Answer: (C) Marian

The model misunderstood the term "last" when sorting alphabets. Even though the prompt has specified, "when asked about the first or the last in alphabetical order, consider "first" to mean closest to 'A' and "last" to mean closest to 'Z'", the model generated an inaccurate response. It is possible that despite the guideline, the model might be considering "last" as the last entry upon sorting names in alphabetical order from 'A' to 'Z', instead of the name closest to 'Z'.

Example 2:
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Model’s Response: (C) 7
Correct Answer: (A) 5

Although the prompt specifically stated, "if asked for 'more than 5 years old', do not count those that are exactly 5 years old," the model counted the ones who were exactly 5 years old, as well. This implies, the model failed to exclude data as expressed.

Based on the errors in these examples, the prompt can be improved in the following aspects:

1. Make the definition of "first"  and "last" clearer in terms of alphabetical order: The model misinterpreted the usage of the word "last". It may need additional instructions to understand the prompt correctly.

2. Explicit instructions on counting: The model failed to count correctly when given explicit instructions in the prompt. Providing additional illustrative, explicit examples may improve the model's ability to interpret and follow these directives.

3. Enhance emphasis: Adding more emphasis on crucial directives like "Do not count those that are exactly 'x' years old when asked for more than 'x' years old" may make these instructions more salient to the model.

4. Include more examples: Including more examples in the prompt may aid in driving home the point more explicitly. 

5. Repeat crucial information: In long prompts such as this, crucial information can get lost or seem less important. Repeating essential points at different stages or reframing them could help the AI to grasp the intended directives. 

6. Understanding of numerical values and comparison: Highlight the difference between exact values and greater than or less than. The model seemed to struggle with the distinction, so the difference should be clearly stated.

(2) In the following task, analyze the table data, which includes information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Respond to the queries based on this data by carefully interpreting and contrasting the information. When the question asks for a count, include or exclude data as explicitly instructed. For instance, if asked for penguins "more than 5 years old", do not count penguins that are exactly 5 years old. When a new entry is added or removed from the table, update your understanding of the total count accordingly. If asked to list or order according to alphabetical or chronological order, follow the standard alphabetical or chronological sequence. If multidisciplinary information is provided, focus solely on the data relevant to the question.

<START>In the following task, you will analyze table data related to various subjects, such as names, ages, heights and weights of different species like penguins or giraffes. Fluent understanding of alphabetic sequencing and numerical comparisons is crucial for accurately answering based on the presented data. If asked to count, follow the directives strictly and only include or exclude data as explicitly outlined. For instance, when the question specifies "more than 5 years old", it distinctly means older than 5 years, thus do not count those that are exactly 5 years old. Remember this numerical specificity in all cases, whenever ages or other numerals are implicated. When dealing with alphabetical order, attention to the entire name is crucial, not just the first letter. Adhere to the standard sequence of the alphabet unless stated otherwise. To clarify, when asked about the first or the last in alphabetical order, "first" means the name that's alphabetically the closest to 'A', and "last" indicates that name which is alphabetically the closest to 'Z'. This concept doesn't consider the position of the names after arranging in alphabetical order. If the tables involve data related to more than one category or species, filter your focus on the table or tables that pertain to the specific question asked. Always update your total count understanding when a new entity is added or removed. Finally, wrap the correct answer between <answer> and </answer> tags for clear visibility.

If asked about the first or the last in alphabetical order, consider "first" to mean closest to 'A' and "last" to mean closest to 'Z', unless otherwise specified. If the task involves tables related to more than one category or species, pay close attention to select and focus only on the table, or tables, relevant to the question. Finally, clearly identify the correct answer and ensure to enclose it between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In question 1, the error arises due to the model's inability to appropriately update the data as specified in the prompt. It is asked to adjust the total count based on the addition of a new entity, i.e., a new penguin added to the table. But the model fails to correctly update the penguin count, leading to the wrong answer, (D) 4, being generated instead of the correct answer, (E) 5. 

<2> 
For question 2, the model struggles with handling the alphabetic order of names. Even though the prompt specified to base the alphabetic order on the entire set of letters in a name, not just the first letter, the model did not respect this rule by choosing (D) Donna, rather than (C) Marian, as the last giraffe alphabetically ordered.

Reasons:
1. The model is not sufficiently updating the count when new data is added to the table.
2. There is a misunderstanding of how to correctly apply alphabetical order, it seems to prioritize the first initial rather than the entire set of letters in the name.

There are several improvements that could be made in the prompt:

1. Emphasize the directions regarding updating the count as data is changed, with more explicit instructions or examples.
2. Further clarify the concept of alphabetical order, providing additional details or examples on comparing the full names and not just the first character.
3. Include a reminder for the model to maintain the prompt's general directives in mind while answering every part of the problem. This reminder could reinforce the importance of continual reference to the prompt guidelines.
4. Lastly, incorporate iterative comprehension learning if possible, which is to let the model learn through its mistakes and successes on these types of tasks.

<START> In this task, you will be given various table data with diverse categories such as names, ages, heights, and weights of certain species like penguins or giraffes. Respond to queries based on the data in these tables by carefully analyzing, interpreting, and comparing the presented information. 

Adhere strictly to all directives, especially when counting items. When the question calls for a count based on specific criteria, such as "more than 5 years old", avoid counting those that do not meet the precise criteria. For instance, in this scenario, you should not include those that are exactly 5 years old. 

Remember to adjust your understanding of the total count whenever a new entity is added or removed from the table. This adjustment is critical to maintaining accurate responses to questions requiring count information. For example, if a new penguin is added to the table, the total count of penguins should be increased by one.

Alphabetical ordering of names also holds importance. When asked to order or list names alphabetically, concentrate on comparing the whole name, not just the first letter. Follow the standard alphabetical order, considering all the letters in the names sequentially. If a question asks about the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, interpret "first" as closest to 'A' in the alphabet and "last" as closest to 'Z', unless otherwise stated.

Some tasks will involve tables related to more than one category or species. In these cases, concentrate your attention on the table, or tables, that are relevant to the question asked. Don't mix up data between different tables.

Lastly, ensure that your answers are clear and precise. Highlight the correct answer by enclosing it between <answer> and </answer> tags for identification. Do remember that accuracy in following these guidelines and directions is crucial for precise responses.

We believe that involving these improvements will help you comprehend and respond to these types of tasks in a more efficacious manner. Keep these guidelines in your mind as you respond to each part of the problem<END>.

gradient:
<1> 
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model's response was: (C) 7
The correct answer is: (A) 5

Reasons for the model's incorrect response:
- Misinterpretation of the directive: The model seems to have not fully grasped the instruction that it should not count animals that are exactly 5 years old. Therefore, it included in the count an animal that was 5 years old, which led to an inaccurate count.
- Lack of clarity in selecting data: The prompt also states that if the model is to deal with multiple categories or species, like penguins and giraffes in this case, it has to focus on the specific table pertaining to the question. However, it seems to have missed that and included animals from both tables rather than one, leading to miscalculation.

<2> 
Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
The model's response was: (D) Gwen
The correct answer is: (C) Vincent

Reasons for the model's incorrect response:
- Misinterpretation of alphabetical order: While the prompt clearly includes instructions about considering the complete name and not just the first letter for alphabetical sorting, the model seems to have followed a piecewise approach. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding in the execution of alphabetizing names according to all letters in the name, not just the first one.

Improvements for the model's prompt based on the errors:
- More clarity on counting: Make clear in the prompt that when counting based on a criterion, animals fitting exactly the criterion should not be included — for example, animals that are 'more than 5 years old' does not include animals that are '5 years old'.
- Sharpen understanding of handling multi-category tables: Further emphasize on the part of the instruction where the need to carefully select and count from the table relevant to the question is crucial, especially when dealing with multiple tables representing different species or categories.
- Enhanced instruction on alphabetical order: The prompt might benefit from clearer and more explicit instructions about how to handle terms in alphabetical order, emphasizing that the order should consider all characters sequentially and not just the first one.

The model's input is:
In the following task, analyze the provided table data, which may include diverse categories such as names, ages, heights, and weights of a certain species like penguins or giraffes. Respond to the queries based on this data by meticulously interpreting and comparing the presented information. When the question asks for a count, adhere strictly to the directives given and exclude or include data as expressly stated. For instance, if asked for "more than 5 years old", do not count those that are exactly 5 years old. Adjust your total count understanding accordingly whenever a new entity is added or removed from the table. If asked to list or order names according to alphabetical order, focus not just on the first letter but on the entire set of letters in the names, and follow the standard sequence unless advised otherwise. If asked about the first or the last in alphabetical order, consider "first" to mean closest to 'A' and "last" to mean closest to 'Z', unless otherwise specified. If the task involves tables related to more than one category or species, pay close attention to select and focus only on the table, or tables, relevant to the question. Finally, clearly identify the correct answer and ensure to enclose it between <answer> and </answer> for clarity.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The penguins sorted by alphabetical order are Bernard, Gwen, Louis, Vincent. Therefore, the last penguin sorted by alphabetical order is <answer>(D) Gwen</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model's response was: (C) 7
The correct answer is: (A) 5

Reasons for the model's incorrect response:
- Misinterpretation of the directive: The model seems to have not fully grasped the instruction that it should not count animals that are exactly 5 years old. Therefore, it included in the count an animal that was 5 years old, which led to an inaccurate count.
- Lack of clarity in selecting data: The prompt also states that if the model is to deal with multiple categories or species, like penguins and giraffes in this case, it has to focus on the specific table pertaining to the question. However, it seems to have missed that and included animals from both tables rather than one, leading to miscalculation.

<2> 
Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
The model's response was: (D) Gwen
The correct answer is: (C) Vincent

Reasons for the model's incorrect response:
- Misinterpretation of alphabetical order: While the prompt clearly includes instructions about considering the complete name and not just the first letter for alphabetical sorting, the model seems to have followed a piecewise approach. This indicates a fundamental misunderstanding in the execution of alphabetizing names according to all letters in the name, not just the first one.

Improvements for the model's prompt based on the errors:
- More clarity on counting: Make clear in the prompt that when counting based on a criterion, animals fitting exactly the criterion should not be included — for example, animals that are 'more than 5 years old' does not include animals that are '5 years old'.
- Sharpen understanding of handling multi-category tables: Further emphasize on the part of the instruction where the need to carefully select and count from the table relevant to the question is crucial, especially when dealing with multiple tables representing different species or categories.
- Enhanced instruction on alphabetical order: The prompt might benefit from clearer and more explicit instructions about how to handle terms in alphabetical order, emphasizing that the order should consider all characters sequentially and not just the first one.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
(2) In the following task, analyze the table data, which includes information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Respond to the queries based on this data by carefully interpreting and contrasting the information. When the question asks for a count, include or exclude data as explicitly instructed. For instance, if asked for penguins "more than 5 years old", do not count penguins that are exactly 5 years old. When a new entry is added or removed from the table, update your understanding of the total count accordingly. If asked to list or order according to alphabetical or chronological order, follow the standard alphabetical or chronological sequence. If multidisciplinary information is provided, focus solely on the data relevant to the question. Finally, indicate the correct answer by clearly stating it and marking it between <answer> and </answer>.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650

Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is:
(D) Donna
<answer>(D)</answer> 

To arrive at this answer, we need to sort the giraffes' names alphabetically and then select the last one. The sorted list of giraffes' names is:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, Donna is the last giraffe when sorted alphabetically.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Wrong Example Analysis:

In this question, the model is asked to analyze data from two different tables and respond to the question about the giraffes' names. The model correctly sorted the names in alphabetical order and selected the last one, 'Donna'. However, the model's answer doesn't match the provided correct label 'C', which corresponds to 'Marian'.

Here are several possible reasons for this discrepancy:

1. Incorrect Correct Answer: The provided correct answer label 'C' may pertain to an incorrect option. Assuming that alphabetical sorting should be done from A to Z, 'Donna' is the correct answer which is in line with the model's response. So, it seems like the prompt/assessment itself may be flawed.

2. Misinterpretation: The model could have misunderstood the prompt instruction. Though the prompt means sorting from A to Z for questions that involve ordering, the model may be pre-programmed or trained to sort in reverse alphabetical order.

Improvements:

1. Clarify the order of sorting: Make sure to provide clear guidance in the prompt regarding the order in which items should be sorted. In alphabetical order, clarity should be provided whether it is from A to Z or vice versa.

2. Include an instruction to cross-verify the result: The prompt should include an instruction to cross-verify the result with the given options, to ensure the chosen answer matches one of the options.

3. Revise Correct Answer: Make sure the correct answers provided match with the logic used in the questions being asked. If alphabetical ordering from A to Z is requested, the correct answer should also correspond to this request.

Overall, it seems like the issue arises from an inconsistency between the logic of the question and the labeled correct answer. Having clear and consistent instructions in the prompt and accurate correct answer labels will help improve the functioning of the language model.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many penguins are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in the table. The penguins with ages greater than 5 are Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). This means there are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: C

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to count the penguins and giraffes whose age is greater than 5 in both tables.

In the penguin table:
- Louis is 7 years old
- Bernard is 5 years old (not more than 5)
- Vincent is 9 years old
- Gwen is 8 years old

In the giraffe table:
- Jody is 5 years old (not more than 5)
- Gladys is 10 years old
- Marian is 2 years old (not more than 5)
- Donna is 9 years old

So, there are a total of 4 animals (Vincent, Gwen, Gladys, Donna) that are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In Example 1, the model incorrectly identified Bernard as a penguin over the age of 5, even though the age was exactly 5 and not more than 5. This confusion arose due to the misunderstanding or overlooking of the condition in the prompt stating "'more than 5' should mean strictly greater than 5, not 5 or more." 

Improvement: The prompt needs to be more explicit about the nuances of the condition and how to interpret it. For instance: 'more than 5' should be strictly more than 5 only, exclude 5 even it is. The model needs to pay careful attention to language cues clarifying the exact conditions, especially in terms of more than, less than, minimum, maximum, etc.

In Example 2, again the model incorrectly takes into account the animals exactly 5 years old. Also, the model ignored Louis who is 7 years old from the penguin table, while counting the animals more than 5 years old. This led to the wrong answer and showed a lack of understanding both the term "more than" and the need to consider all relevant tables to extract the correct information.

Improvement:
1. The prompt can emphasize to treat multiple tables separately first and then combine the findings. This procedure would have stopped the model from missing Louis from the penguin table.
2. The prompt can say: 'For questions involving multiple tables, ensure to analyze and interpret all the tables together to conclude the result.'
3. Furthermore, the statement should be added: 'Remember that each line after the header across all tables refers to a different entity (penguin or giraffe). All entities must be considered while addressing the given question.'

For both examples, the prompt could be improved by incorporating these points. These improvements would help guide the model to read more attentively and reason about the question more accurately, particularly when it comes to understanding conditions and dealing with complex, multi-faceted information. 

Also, an additional suggestion would be to reinforce the importance of auditing and checking the final findings before delivering the answer. This practice would help in picking up any discrepancies or anomalies, reducing the margin of error for the final answer, thus improving accuracy.

gradient:
<1> 
Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old?

Model's Answer: (D) 4

Correct Answer: (C) 3

Reasoning: The model did not adhere strictly to the condition 'more than 5' which should mean strictly greater than 5, not 5 or more. Consequently, it incorrectly included the penguin Bernard, whose age is exactly 5, as part of the penguins older than 5 years.

<2> 
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Model's Answer: (D) Donna

Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Reasoning: The model has made an error in understanding the question. Although the prompt called for it to respect alphabetical order (sorting from A to Z), it incorrectly sorted the names in reverse alphabetical order instead, and therefore gave the wrong answer.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Emphasize again that 'more than 5' means strictly greater than 5, not inclusive of 5. This could potentially be reinforced through an example in the task instructions. 

2. Clarify sorting orders, specifying that 'alphabetical order' means ordering the items from A to Z. This could also benefit from being demonstrated via an example.

3. Perhaps the prompt could remind the model to check its work for errors, having it review its conclusions against the original task instructions to confirm accuracy before providing an answer.

4. The instructions to the model could be clearer in directing the model to consider all elements relevant to the question, but to be careful not to include data that is not specifically relevant. In the wrong example 1, Bernard was included, which was incorrect.

5. The instructions could further emphasize on identifying the specific table referred to in the question when multiple tables are present. This will prevent confusion or the possibility of the model using data from the incorrect table. 

Overall, having examples to demonstrate each instruction in the prompt might improve the model's performance significantly. Plus, encouraging it to double-check its conclusions could potentially help catch errors like the one made in the second example.

The name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is (D) Donna.

Explanation:
The giraffes are sorted alphabetically by name as follows:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the last giraffe when sorted alphabetically is Donna. So, the correct answer is (D) Donna. 

<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old?

Model's Answer: (D) 4

Correct Answer: (C) 3

Reasoning: The model did not adhere strictly to the condition 'more than 5' which should mean strictly greater than 5, not 5 or more. Consequently, it incorrectly included the penguin Bernard, whose age is exactly 5, as part of the penguins older than 5 years.

<2> 
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Model's Answer: (D) Donna

Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Reasoning: The model has made an error in understanding the question. Although the prompt called for it to respect alphabetical order (sorting from A to Z), it incorrectly sorted the names in reverse alphabetical order instead, and therefore gave the wrong answer.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Emphasize again that 'more than 5' means strictly greater than 5, not inclusive of 5. This could potentially be reinforced through an example in the task instructions. 

2. Clarify sorting orders, specifying that 'alphabetical order' means ordering the items from A to Z. This could also benefit from being demonstrated via an example.

3. Perhaps the prompt could remind the model to check its work for errors, having it review its conclusions against the original task instructions to confirm accuracy before providing an answer.

4. The instructions to the model could be clearer in directing the model to consider all elements relevant to the question, but to be careful not to include data that is not specifically relevant. In the wrong example 1, Bernard was included, which was incorrect.

5. The instructions could further emphasize on identifying the specific table referred to in the question when multiple tables are present. This will prevent confusion or the possibility of the model using data from the incorrect table. 

Overall, having examples to demonstrate each instruction in the prompt might improve the model's performance significantly. Plus, encouraging it to double-check its conclusions could potentially help catch errors like the one made in the second example.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Wrong Answer Reasoning:

The key misunderstanding in this problem came from the question sentence - ''more than 5' strictly means the values greater than 5 only, definitely not 5 or values less than 5'. Misinterpretation of this statement led the AI to include an animal with the age of 5 years in its calculation, specifically, Bernard who is exactly 5 years old. The correct understanding should be that animals that are strictly above the age of 5 are to be considered. Thus, Bernard should not have been included in the final count. 

Improvements: 

1. Elaborate on the point about comprehending the question conditions with higher precision such as giving explicit examples about 'more than' and 'less than' to clarify such misconceptions.
2. Prompt can instruct the model about not bypassing or overlooking vital instructions given distinctly in the question.
3. It can be more explicit about how the model should handle edge cases like when a value is exactly equal to the boundary condition. 

Generic Issues:

1. The AI might not have an in-depth understanding of the terms like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to' in mathematical contexts.
2. There is a possibility of errors owing to oversight or misinterpretation of critical instructions or information.
3. The emphasis laid in strict adherence to question conditions needs to be improved.
4. The AI may need more enhancement when handling edge cases.

Proposed Improvement:

Revamp the condition statement prompt by adding examples and clarifying instructions to: 'Understand the question conditions with utmost precision. For instance, in numerical conditions when asked for 'more than 5' strictly consider the values greater than 5 only, definitely not 5 or values less than 5. If 'at least' or 'more than or equal to' is mentioned, you can include 5, but in the case of 'more than', neglect the value of 5. If there are edge cases where value equals boundary condition, neglect them unless otherwise specified in the question.' The revised prompt would clarify potential ambiguity and provide the AI with the logic behind mathematical comparisons.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old: Louis (7 years), Vincent (9 years), Gwen (8 years), and Bernard (5 years is not more than 5). Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reason for Mistake 1:
The language model correctly interpreted the data provided in the table and followed the instruction to discard values that are not greater than 5. However, the model included Bernard (5 years) as more than 5 years old, which is contrary to the confinement of the prompt where it specifically mentioned 'more than 5' strictly means the values greater than 5 only, not 5 or any values less than 5. This indicates that the model did not comprehend this instruction accurately leading to an incorrect answer.
   
Based on this, the following aspects can improve the prompt:

1. Clarity on definitions: Ensure that 'more than' is clearly explained with an example in a separate line. This might help the model in developing a better understanding of the term.

2. Emphasizing logical interpretation: Reiterate the importance of strict adherence to logical reasoning. That means if a value is equal to the given number, it should not be considered as 'more than' the given number. 

3. Greater focus on conditions: The restrictions or conditions related to values may need more emphasizing. The semantic interpretation of such conditions, like 'values strictly greater than a given number', should be pointed out more accurately to avoid any misinterpretation.

4. Prediction accuracy: Encourage the model to reiterate the prediction before finalizing to ensure accuracy and minimize overlooking important details. 

5. Testing comprehension: Possibly include a comprehension check for understanding complex instructions in the prompt. This can help ensure that the model has accurately understood the instruction given.

These improvements would aid in increasing the overall effectiveness and accuracy of the prompt.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Before you begin, pay meticulous attention to the data provided in the table(s) about different animals (age, height, and weight). Be vigilant if any updates to the data are provided. Understand with clarity, when the question states 'more than 5', it means exclusivity towards values greater than 5 only. It definitely does not include 5 or any values less than 5. To distinguish, remember 'more than 5' implies a value like 5.01 but not 5 or 4.99. If you encounter multiple tables, first, analyze the data provided in each one individually and then accumulate the information. Identify the table (or tables) that aligns with the context of the question. Use this information to formulate the answers, keeping in mind all the details from the question. In cases where you need to put data in a certain order, such as alphabetical, understand it as sorting from A to Z. When given multiple-choice questions, please offer only the correct answer label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Do ensure that your answer is correctly bracketed between <answer> and </answer> without any typographical errors. At the end, elaborate your methodology of finding the answer to maintain transparency in your response. Repeat your answer to ensure it meets all conditions specified in the question to minimize the chance of overlooking any detail. Always bear in mind that each item presented in a row of the table(s) represents an individual entity (penguin, giraffe, etc.). Therefore, you must consider all entities while answering questions. Always adhere to the conditions given in the questions; they are to be followed strictly. Before giving the final answer ensure that the numerical definitions have been considered correctly and precision has been maintained while interpreting 'more than' conditions. <END>

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(D)</answer>

There are now a total of 5 penguins in the table after adding James.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reason 1:
The model might have misinterpreted the question or misunderstood the updated table. The failure to recognize that James was added to the table and that there were originally 4 penguins listed before the addition suggests that the instruction related to analyzing updates to the data was not clearly understood or applied by the model. 

Wrong Example Reason 2:
The follow-up instruction: "Crosscheck your findings before settling on the final answer" was probably not accurately executed by the model. If the model had actually revisited its findings, it would have recognized the count after the addition was wrong. 

Wrong Example Reason 3:
The instruction: "Frame your answer properly between <answer> and </answer> without any syntax error" could have been misunderstood as maintaining only the format rather than ensuring the content within the frame was correct. 

Prompt Improvement 1:
Expand the instructions relating to how the model should handle updates to the data. Mention explicitly that the model should keep track of additions and deletions as well as changes to existing data.

Prompt Improvement 2:
Stress the need for accurate numerical calculations in the instructions. Insist on the importance of verifying these calculations and apply the corrections if any error is detected.

Prompt Improvement 3:
Make the instructions about responses more clear. Make explicit that the accuracy of the inside content holds the same significance as the format of the answer.

Prompt Improvement 4:
Further emphasize the importance of following the conditions given in the questions. Instructions must stress that every given condition and contextual information has to be considered while answering the question, and each step of evaluation should be in line with the given conditions and context. 

Prompt Improvement 5:
Add an instruction reminding the model that changes to the data like additions or deletions alter the totals and this should be recognized while answering the questions.

Make the instructions about responses more clear. Make explicit that the accuracy of the inside content holds the same significance as the format of the answer.

Prompt Improvement 4:
Further emphasize the importance of following the conditions given in the questions. Instructions must stress that every given condition and contextual information has to be considered while answering the question, and each step of evaluation should be in line with the given conditions and context. 

Prompt Improvement 5:
Add an instruction reminding the model that changes to the data like additions or deletions alter the totals and this should be recognized while answering the questions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
(2) Carefully examine the given table data about penguins (age, height, and weight). Analyze updates to the data if given. Understand the question conditions precisely - for instance, 'more than 5' should mean strictly greater than 5, not 5 or more. If there are multiple tables, identify the specific table referred to in the question. Use this analysis to answer the questions, considering all information provided in the question. If the question involves ordering, such as alphabetical order, it means sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Bracket your answer properly between <answer> and </answer> without any syntax error. Explain your process of arriving at each answer for auditing purposes.
(3) Carefully inspect the given table(s) data about animals (age, height, and weight). Analyze any updates to the data if presented. Understand the question conditions with precision - 'more than 5' strictly means the values greater than 5 only, definitely not 5 or values less than 5. If there are multiple tables, analyze data for each table individually first and then consolidate the information. Identify the specific table(s) as per the context of the question. Utilize this analysis to answer the questions, considering all details provided in the question. If the question necessitates ordering, such as alphabetical order, interpret it as sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Frame your answer properly between <answer> and </answer> without any syntax error. Lastly, elucidate your approach of finding the answer to sustain accountability in your answer. Crosscheck your findings before settling on the final answer to minimize common errors or oversight. Understand that each row in the table(s) depicts a separate entity (penguin, giraffe, etc.), all entities must be taken into account while answering the question. Keep in mind that the conditions given in the questions are paramount and must be adhered to strictly.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order, we need to sort the names of the giraffes in the table alphabetically.

The names of the giraffes in alphabetical order are:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. The language model seems confused by the instruction to perform alphabetical sorting of names of giraffes. The term "last" in alphabetical order is ambiguous—it could mean either the last in the sequence (i.e., the name that is alphabetically after all others) or the last in an original list after sorting. In this case, the model assumed the former, meaning "alphabetically after all others", and sorted the giraffes' names, resulting in Donna being the 'last' name in the alphabetical order.

2. The model may have processed options for the multiple-choice question after conducting the analysis, leading to ignoring the option (E) Louise, which was not present in the original list of giraffes. This resulted in the model selecting Donna (D) instead of the correct answer, Louise (E).

3. The model seems to lack an understanding of sorting in the context of the provided options in the question.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify the meaning of 'last' in an alphabetical sorting context to prevent confusion.
   
2. Emphasize that the answer could potentially include options not originally listed in the table or the data provided. 

3. Provide clearer instructions when dealing with multiple-choice questions—ensure the model understands it has to consider all options before making a selection, not just the entities pre-existing in the data.

4. For sorting questions, point out the need to consider the sorting within the given answer options not just within the data presented in the table.

5. Instruct the model to cross-examine the answer options with the results from the table analysis, to prevent overlooking correct options not presented in the original data.
   
6. Clearly indicate that the 'last' in the alphabetical order means the name that is alphabetically after all others. 

Overall, the prompt should provide more specific instructions to the model about examining all answer options in multiple-choice questions and handling ambiguous terminology in the questions.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order, we need to sort the names of the giraffes in the table alphabetically:

1. Donna
2. Gladys
3. Jody
4. Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> In this example, the question asks the model to identify the name of the last giraffe when sorted in alphabetic order. The answer given by the model is incorrect. Instead of sorting the names alphabetically from A-Z and identifying 'Marian' as the last giraffe in ascending order (the correct answer 'C'), it incorrectly assumes the sorting should be in descending order and identifies 'Donna' as the last giraffe (wrong answer 'D').

Reasons for this error could be:
a) Misinterpretation: The prompt might not have made it clear enough that the alphabetic sort order should be from A-Z, leading to some misunderstanding. Even though the prompt does mention understanding an alphabetical sort as an order from A-Z, having it written out explicitly in relation to the task at hand would be clearer and potentially prevent such errors.
b) Specificity: As the instructions are highly detailed and complex, the model may have got confused by its specificity and complexity, leading to a flawed understanding and erroneous output.

Improvements for the prompt:

1) Further Clarification: Consider adding clearer directives on performing sort operations. For instance, emphasize that 'alphabetical sorting' means placing items in order from A-Z. 
   
2) Simplification: Because the instructions are densely packed, you may want to consider condensing the prompt. Use simple and concise language wherever possible, avoiding redundancies.
  
3) Task-Specific Instruction: Make sure instructions in the prompt are fully understood in the context of the task. Specify precisely how alphabetical sorting should be conducted in the case of multi-choice questions.

4) Direct References: Consider highlighting or using direct references when mention features of the tables like columns, row operations, and sort operations in order to guide the model's understanding of the context better.
   
5) Eliminate Ambiguity: Ensure there is no room for interpretation where instructions are concerned - clearly state what means what and what doesn't. 

Summary of Improvements:
1) Add clearer directives
2) Condense the prompt and simplify language
3) Add task-specific instructions
4) Directly reference table features
5) Eliminate ambiguity in instructions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order, we need to sort the giraffes' names in alphabetical order and then select the last one.

The giraffes' names in alphabetical order are:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order is (D) Donna.

<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Wrong answer: (D) Donna

Analysis: This error arises because the model misunderstood the meaning of "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order". When names are sorted in alphabetical order (A-Z), the last name is the one that would come last in the alphabetic sequence not according to the table order. In this case, it should be Marian, not Donna. 

Reasons:
1. Lack of Explicit Direction: While the prompt does instruct the model to perform alphabetical sorting, it does not explicitly state that the 'last' entity when sorted from 'A to Z' would be at the end of the list, and not at the end of the original order of names. 
2. Ambiguity: The term 'last' could potentially be misinterpreted as referring to the 'last' entity in the dataset, rather than the 'last' entity when sorted alphabetically. 

Improvements:
1. Clarify Wording: Make it clear in the prompt that when a question asks for 'the last entity' after performing a certain operation (such as sorting), it refers to the entity at the final position after the operation has been carried out.
2. More Precise Definitions: Include more precise definitions for terms like 'last' when used within the context of sorting or arranging entities.
3. Explicit Instructions: While the prompt does instruct the model to be sensitive to changes in order of the information in the table, it might be helpful to include explicit instruction highlighting that the original order of items in the dataset may not always correspond to the order asked for in the question.
4. Examples: Provide examples of correct interpretation and application of the question's conditions.
5. Emphasize Alphabetical Order: While the model is asked to understand alphabetical order as A to Z, it will be beneficial to explicitly mention that when asked for the 'last' in an alphabetically ordered list, it means the name that comes last in the alphabetical order.

If there are multiple tables, identify the specific table referred to in the question. Use this analysis to answer the questions, considering all information provided in the question. If the question involves ordering, such as alphabetical order, it means sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Bracket your answer properly between <answer> and </answer> without any syntax error. Explain your process of arriving at each answer for auditing purposes.
(3) Carefully inspect the given table(s) data about animals (age, height, and weight). Analyze any updates to the data if presented. Understand the question conditions with precision - 'more than 5' strictly means the values greater than 5 only, definitely not 5 or values less than 5. If there are multiple tables, analyze data for each table individually first and then consolidate the information. Identify the specific table(s) as per the context of the question. Utilize this analysis to answer the questions, considering all details provided in the question. If the question necessitates ordering, such as alphabetical order, interpret it as sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.).

gradient:
<1>
(i) Question's analysis:
The question asks to count the number of animals that are "more than 5 years old". According to the instruction in the prompt, "more than 5" should exclude an animal of exactly 5 years. Thus, animals of exactly 5 years should be excluded from the count. 

(ii) Model's error:
The model considered animals of exactly 5 years old (Bernard and Jody) as the qualified animals which are against the instructions in the prompt.

(iii) Reason for error:
The model's failure to accurately comprehend the meaning of "more than 5" as described in the prompt can be interpreted as lack of precise understanding of numerical boundary conditions. The model incorrectly counted animals that are exactly 5 years old.

(iv) How can the prompt be improved:
The prompt can be improved by emphasizing further on the meaning of terminologies such as "more than". A more deterministic language can be used to stress the importance of numerical constraints, stating that "more than 5" surely means "strictly values greater than 5, not including 5".

Corrected prompt:
Examine the data provided in the table(s) about various animals (age, height, weight) carefully. Should there be a change in the given data later, adjust accordingly. It's critical to accurately understand the conditions of the question - Terms such as 'more than 5' particularly and strictly refer to the values greater than 5 only. Specifically, these conditions do not include the value of 5 or any amounts less than 5. For instance, an animal of exactly 5 years old must not be counted. Similarly, terms signifying 'at least' or 'more than or equal to' enable the inclusion of 5 in the count. For 'more than', specifically refrain from including the value of 5. It's essential to assess edge cases thoughtfully, especially when a value equals the boundary condition, unless otherwise mentioned in the question. When dealing with multiple tables, analyze the data for each table separately before merging the information. Identify the specific table(s) using the context of the question. Make good use of this in-depth analysis process to answer the questions, keeping each and every detail present in the question in mind. If the question necessitates an order such as alphabetical, consider it as ordering from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions answer solely with the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Respond by enclosing your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags with no syntax errors. Make sure to elaborate on your approach to answer for maintaining transparency in your reply. Carefully review your final answers to rectify errors or any inadvertent omissions. Remember that each row in the table(s) symbolizes a distinct entity (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.) - do not forget to consider all distinct entities when answering. Lastly, abiding by the exact conditions stated in the questions is essential, so be mindful of the detailed instructions in each question.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Scrutinize the data provided in the table(s) about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay attentive to any changes in the data if provided later. Prioritize understanding the conditions of the question - Terms such as 'more than 5' strictly refer to the values greater than 5 only, certainly not including 5 or any values less than 5. For instance, an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be considered. For conditions mentioning 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', you could include 5, but for 'more than', exclude the value of 5. Keep in mind to handle edge cases thoughtfully where a value equals the boundary condition, unless explicitly mentioned in the question. When dealing with multiple tables, first dissect the data for each table individually before amalgamating the information. Identify the particular table(s) based on the context of the question. Use this thorough analysis to resolve the questions, taking into account every detail present in the question. If the question requires an order, such as alphabetical, consider it as ordering from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Use <answer> and </answer> tags to frame your response without any syntactic errors. Don't forget to explicate your approach to arrive at the answer to maintain transparency in your response.

(3) Carefully inspect the given table(s) data about animals (age, height, and weight). Analyze any updates to the data if presented. Understand the question conditions with precision - 'more than 5' strictly means the values greater than 5 only, definitely not 5 or values less than 5. If there are multiple tables, analyze data for each table individually first and then consolidate the information. Identify the specific table(s) as per the context of the question. Utilize this analysis to answer the questions, considering all details provided in the question. If the question necessitates ordering, such as alphabetical order, interpret it as sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.).

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?

Correct Answer: (A) 5

Model's Answer: (C) 7

Analysis:
The model misunderstood the term "more than 5" incorrectly, including animals that are exactly 5 years old. The animal Bernard the penguin and Jody the giraffe both are 5 years old but the model considered them as well. The clear instructions of considering the values greater than 5 exclusively, not including 5 or less, were not followed.

The prompt could benefit from emphasizing the importance of precise adherence to mathematical conditions and expressions used in the questions.

The prompt instructs to order alphabetically from A to Z, but how the 'last' element should be interpreted isn't clear. From context, we know it should be the 'last' in an A-Z order, but the model has misunderstood this to refer to the last element in the alphabetically ordered list. 

The language used in the prompt needs to be clarified in this regard.

Summary of Improvement Points:

1. Clarify the implementation of mathematical conditions in the prompt. Ensure the model understands the exclusive nature of a particular value when terms like 'more than' are used.

2. Define 'last' more clearly in the context of alphabetical order. Specify whether sorting of data should be ascending or descending.

3. Accentuate the importance of precision and attention to detail in understanding the requirements of a question. 

4. The emphasis could be given on understanding the terms in the context of the question. 

5. Instructions about specific conditions such as 'not including the boundary value' could be made more explicit or repeated to avoid oversight.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Scrutinize the data provided in the table(s) about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay attentive to any changes in the data if provided later. Prioritize understanding the conditions of the question - Terms such as 'more than 5' strictly refer to the values greater than 5 only, certainly not including 5 or any values less than 5. For instance, an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be considered. For conditions mentioning 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', you could include 5, but for 'more than', exclude the value of 5. Keep in mind to handle edge cases thoughtfully where a value equals the boundary condition, unless explicitly mentioned in the question. When dealing with multiple tables, first dissect the data for each table individually before amalgamating the information. Identify the particular table(s) based on the context of the question. Use this thorough analysis to resolve the questions, taking into account every detail present in the question. If the question requires an order, such as alphabetical, consider it as ordering from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Use <answer> and </answer> tags to frame your response without any syntactic errors. Don't forget to explicate your approach to arrive at the answer to maintain transparency in your response. Review your findings prior to finalizing the answer to eliminate errors or oversight. Remember, each row in the table(s) represents a distinct entity (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.), ensure to consider all such entities when providing your answer. Remember, adhering to the exact conditions given in the questions is imperative.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted alphabetically, we need to arrange the giraffes' names in alphabetical order and then select the last one.

The giraffes' names in alphabetical order are:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted alphabetically is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?

Correct Answer: (A) 5

Model's Answer: (C) 7

Analysis:
The model misunderstood the term "more than 5" incorrectly, including animals that are exactly 5 years old. The animal Bernard the penguin and Jody the giraffe both are 5 years old but the model considered them as well. The clear instructions of considering the values greater than 5 exclusively, not including 5 or less, were not followed.

The prompt could benefit from emphasizing the importance of precise adherence to mathematical conditions and expressions used in the questions.

<2> 

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Model's Answer: (D) Donna 

Analysis:
The prompt instructs to order alphabetically from A to Z, but how the 'last' element should be interpreted isn't clear. From context, we know it should be the 'last' in an A-Z order, but the model has misunderstood this to refer to the last element in the alphabetically ordered list.

Summary of Improvement Points:

1. Clarify the implementation of mathematical conditions in the prompt. Ensure the model understands the exclusive nature of a particular value when terms like 'more than' are used.

2. Define 'last' more clearly in the context of alphabetical order. Specify whether sorting of data should be ascending or descending.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given table data to answer questions about penguins' age, height, and weight. Identify the correct response by comparing and interpreting the information.
(2) Carefully examine the given table data about penguins (age, height, and weight). Analyze updates to the data if given. Understand the question conditions precisely - for instance, 'more than 5' should mean strictly greater than 5, not 5 or more. If there are multiple tables, identify the specific table referred to in the question. Use this analysis to answer the questions, considering all information provided in the question. If the question involves ordering, such as alphabetical order, it means sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Bracket your answer properly between <answer> and </answer> without any syntax error. Explain your process of arriving at each answer for auditing purposes.
(3) Carefully inspect the given table(s) data about animals (age, height, and weight). Analyze any updates to the data if presented. Understand the question conditions with precision - 'more than 5' strictly means the values greater than 5 only, definitely not 5 or values less than 5. If there are multiple tables, analyze data for each table individually first and then consolidate the information. Identify the specific table(s) as per the context of the question. Utilize this analysis to answer the questions, considering all details provided in the question. If the question necessitates ordering, such as alphabetical order, interpret it as sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Frame your answer properly between <answer> and </answer> without any syntax error. Lastly, elucidate your approach of finding the answer to sustain accountability in your answer. Crosscheck your findings before settling on the final answer to minimize common errors or oversight. Understand that each row in the table(s) depicts a separate entity (penguin, giraffe, etc.), all entities must be taken into account while answering the question. Keep in mind that the conditions given in the questions are paramount and must be adhered to strictly.
(4) Scrutinize the data provided in the table(s) about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay attentive to any changes in the data if provided later.

The prompt clearly mentions that "Terms such as 'more than 5' strictly refer to the values greater than 5 only, certainly not including 5 or any values less than 5" this statement is clear, but the model misinterpreted the boundary condition. The model has included the animals aged exactly 5 in its answer, which leads to the incorrect prediction, (C) instead of (A).

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
- Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

The model has followed the ordering instruction from the prompt as A to Z. However, the model used the wrong order of alphabets as it missed one option "Louise". It did not consider all the options given in the multiple-choice questions, leading to an incorrect prediction, (D) instead of (C).

Based on these two mistakes, we can notice:

- The model fails to correctly interpret the boundary condition of 'more than 5' and includes values equal to 5 in its calculations. It is necessary to clarify this detail in the prompt.
- The model doesn't consider all the options provided in multiple-choice questions while solving the question, which can lead it to miss the correct answer.

Improvements for the Prompt:

- Over-emphasize the handling of the boundary condition in the prompt and explain the concept of 'more than 5' in a more detailed manner.
- Mention the importance of considering all possible choices in multiple-choice questions before deciding on an answer.
- Include a line in the prompt to consider all the data given.
- Instruct the model to ensure cross-verification of its answer with the question and answer choices before finalizing.
- To increase accuracy, give an extra guideline to the model to re-evaluate data concerning the question, such as "Verify the direct data given in the question again if necessary."
- Additionally, you can include a hint specifying that all parts of the input should be used, and that none should be dismissed. This includes both direct data and multiple-choice options.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Scrutinize the data provided in the table(s) about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay attentive to any changes in the data if provided later. Prioritize understanding the conditions of the question - Terms such as 'more than 5' strictly refer to the values greater than 5 only, certainly not including 5 or any values less than 5. For instance, an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be considered. For conditions mentioning 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', you could include 5, but for 'more than', exclude the value of 5. Keep in mind to handle edge cases thoughtfully where a value equals the boundary condition, unless explicitly mentioned in the question. When dealing with multiple tables, first dissect the data for each table individually before amalgamating the information. Identify the particular table(s) based on the context of the question. Use this thorough analysis to resolve the questions, taking into account every detail present in the question. If the question requires an order, such as alphabetical, consider it as ordering from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Use <answer> and </answer> tags to frame your response without any syntactic errors. Don't forget to explicate your approach to arrive at the answer to maintain transparency in your response. Review your findings prior to finalizing the answer to eliminate errors or oversight. Remember, each row in the table(s) represents a distinct entity (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.), ensure to consider all such entities when providing your answer. Remember, adhering to the exact conditions given in the questions is imperative.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are a total of 7 animals that are more than 5 years old. These animals are Louis, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, Donna. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 7</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.

Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order, we need to arrange the giraffes' names in alphabetical order first:

1. Donna
2. Gladys
3. Jody
4. Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetical order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Carefully examine the data shared in the tables featuring information about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay alert for any alterations or updates to the provided data. It's vital to comprehend correctly the parameters of the question - For instance, 'more than 5' expressly excludes the value 5 and includes only the values strictly greater than 5. A perfect embodiment of this would be an animal of exactly 5 years old, which should not be included in this assessment. The condition 'at least' refers to 5 or more, including 5, unlike 'more than' which strictly excludes 5. Strategically handle edge cases, particularly where a figure equals the boundary condition, unless directly specified otherwise in the question. When examining multiple tables, initially scrutinize each table's data independently prior to integrating the information. Ascertain the particular table(s) based on the question's context. Utilize this comprehensive analysis to answer the questions, considering each and every detail mentioned in the question. In case of an ordering requirement, such as alphabetical, view it as ordering from A-Z. For multiple-choice questions, peruse each option carefully before zeroing in on the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Insert <answer> and </answer> tags to frame your response, ensuring it's free of syntactic errors. Transparency is key, ensure you articulate your method to reach the answer in order to clarify your approach. Re-examine your findings before locking in your final answer to circumvent errors or oversights. Acknowledge that each row in the table symbolizes a unique creature (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.), and consider all such entities while drafting your solution. Compliance with the conditions laid out in the questions is non-negotiable and of paramount importance. Verify the direct data given in the question again if necessary and consider all the data provided, including all the multiple-choice options before you finalize your answer. <END>

   prompt: Your task is to analyze and answer queries based on a data table containing information like names, ages, heights, and weights of penguins. Carefully interpret, compare, and contrast the information as needed. When a question necessitates counting, consider only the data specifically mentioned. For example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years old", understand that penguins exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Be mindful of additions or deletions from the data table and update your total count accordingly.
If the question involves listing or ordering data, ensure you understand what is being asked. When asked for the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, remember that 'A' comes first and 'Z' comes last, alphabetically. When chronological order is required, oldest comes first and newest comes last. If at any point multidisciplinary information is provided, concentrate only on the data that is relevant to the question. At the end of answering each query, clearly state the correct answer, then demarcate your final answer using <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end for emphasis.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze and answer queries based on a data table containing information such as names, ages, heights, and weights of various animals, like penguins in this case. Be meticulous in your interpretation, comparison, and contrasting of the information. If the question asks for counting specific types of data, focus strictly on data that fits the specifications outlined in the question. For instance, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years", do not include penguins that are exactly 5 years old in your count. Stay alert to any changes in the data table, like additions or deletions, and update your findings accordingly.

In cases where the query involves listing or ordering data, ensure you grasp the entire requirement. For an "alphabetically first" or "alphabetically last" question, 'alphabetically first' refers to the name closest to 'A' in the alphabet while 'alphabetically last' means the name closest to 'Z'. If chronological order is needed, oldest comes first and newest comes last.

When information from multiple disciplines is provided, focus strictly on the data pertinent to the question at hand. Conclude your answer by clearly stating it and emphasize your final answer by encasing it between <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end. Always confirm your comprehension of key question terms and instruction components before presenting your final answer.

   prompt: Your assignment is to analyze data from tables and answer queries about a variety of animals, like penguins, for example. The tables will include information like names, ages, heights, and weights. Approach your analysis with precision, comparing, contrasting, and interpreting the data as required. If a question pertains to counting specific types of data, adhere strictly to the outlined specifications in the question. As an example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years," your count should exclude penguins that are exactly 5 years old. Stay vigilant for any amendments in the data table, such as additions or deletions, and adjust your analysis accordingly.

For questions where the objective is to list or order data, comprehend the detail of the requirement fully. If you are asked about the "first" and "last" in alphabetic order, understand that 'first alphabetically' signifies the name that would appear first if the names were listed in alphabetical order from 'A' to 'Z', and 'last alphabetically' signifies the name that would appear last in the same alphabetical list. Similarly, in terms of age, the 'oldest' is the one with the maximum age, and the 'newest' or 'youngest' is the one with the minimum age.

When information is provided across different domains, concentrate strictly on the data that relates directly to the question at hand. Wrap up your answer by stating it explicitly, and highlight this by enclosing it in <answer> at the start and </answer> at the end. Always ensure that you fully understand the key terms and components of the instructions before you finalize your answer.

For instance, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years", do not include penguins that are exactly 5 years old in your count. Stay alert to any changes in the data table, like additions or deletions, and update your findings accordingly.

In cases where the query involves listing or ordering data, ensure you grasp the entire requirement. For an "alphabetically first" or "alphabetically last" question, 'alphabetically first' refers to the name closest to 'A' in the alphabet while 'alphabetically last' means the name closest to 'Z'. If chronological order is needed, oldest comes first and newest comes last.

When information from multiple disciplines is provided, focus strictly on the data pertinent to the question at hand. Conclude your answer by clearly stating it and emphasize your final answer by encasing it between <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end. Always confirm your comprehension of key question terms and instruction components before presenting your final answer.

   prompt: Your assignment is to analyze data from tables and answer queries about a variety of animals, like penguins, for example. The tables will include information like names, ages, heights, and weights. Approach your analysis with precision, comparing, contrasting, and interpreting the data as required. If a question pertains to counting specific types of data, adhere strictly to the outlined specifications in the question. As an example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years," your count should exclude penguins that are exactly 5 years old. Stay vigilant for any amendments in the data table, such as additions or deletions, and adjust your analysis accordingly.

For questions where the objective is to list or order data, comprehend the detail of the requirement fully. If you are asked about the "first" and "last" in alphabetic order, understand that 'first alphabetically' signifies the name that would appear first if the names were listed in alphabetical order from 'A' to 'Z', and 'last alphabetically' signifies the name that would appear last in the same alphabetical list. Similarly, in terms of age, the 'oldest' is the one with the maximum age, and the 'newest' or 'youngest' is the one with the minimum age.

When information is provided across different domains, concentrate strictly on the data that relates directly to the question at hand. Wrap up your answer by stating it explicitly, and highlight this by enclosing it in <answer> at the start and </answer> at the end. Always ensure that you fully understand the key terms and components of the instructions before you finalize your answer.

   prompt: Scrutinize the data provided in the table(s) about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay attentive to any changes in the data if provided later. Prioritize understanding the conditions of the question - Terms such as 'more than 5' strictly refer to the values greater than 5 only, certainly not including 5 or any values less than 5. For instance, an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be considered. For conditions mentioning 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', you could include 5, but for 'more than', exclude the value of 5. Keep in mind to handle edge cases thoughtfully where a value equals the boundary condition, unless explicitly mentioned in the question. When dealing with multiple tables, first dissect the data for each table individually before amalgamating the information. Identify the particular table(s) based on the context of the question. Use this thorough analysis to resolve the questions, taking into account every detail present in the question. If the question requires an order, such as alphabetical, consider it as ordering from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.).

   prompt: Thoroughly examine the data present in the table(s) pertaining to various animals such as age, height, and weight. Should there be any updates in the data, adapt your analysis accordingly. Grasp the exact conditions specified in the question - Interpret phrases like 'more than 5' to mean exclusively numbers greater than 5, absolutely not including 5 or any numbers less than 5. For example, an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Conversely, when the question specifies 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', that allows for the inclusion of the number 5 in your count, but in cases of 'more than', strictly exclude the number 5. Handle edge cases carefully, especially when a value corresponds to the boundary condition, unless the question explicitly asks you to factor it in. When dealing with multiple tables, commence your analysis by scrutinizing each table individually before your merge the insights. Identify the relevant table(s) by using the context presented in the question. Use this meticulous analysis to respond to the questions, keeping every detail present in the question in mind. If the question asks for ordering, such as alphabetical order, interpret it as sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide merely the label of the correct option (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Frame your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags ensuring there are no syntax errors. Explain your solution process for transparency and auditing purposes. Reexamine your results before finalizing the answer to avoid common errors or oversights. Bear in mind that each row in the table(s) denotes a unique entity (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.) - be careful to consider all such entities when formulating your answer. Remember, conforming to the specific conditions given in the questions is of the utmost importance.

   prompt: Your assignment is to analyze data from tables and answer queries about a variety of animals, like penguins, for example. The tables will include information like names, ages, heights, and weights. Approach your analysis with precision, comparing, contrasting, and interpreting the data as required. If a question pertains to counting specific types of data, adhere strictly to the outlined specifications in the question. As an example, if the question asks for penguins "older than 5 years," your count should exclude penguins that are exactly 5 years old. Stay vigilant for any amendments in the data table, such as additions or deletions, and adjust your analysis accordingly.

For questions where the objective is to list or order data, comprehend the detail of the requirement fully. If you are asked about the "first" and "last" in alphabetic order, understand that 'first alphabetically' signifies the name that would appear first if the names were listed in alphabetical order from 'A' to 'Z', and 'last alphabetically' signifies the name that would appear last in the same alphabetical list. Similarly, in terms of age, the 'oldest' is the one with the maximum age, and the 'newest' or 'youngest' is the one with the minimum age.

When information is provided across different domains, concentrate strictly on the data that relates directly to the question at hand. Wrap up your answer by stating it explicitly, and highlight this by enclosing it in <answer> at the start and </answer> at the end.

   prompt: Your task involves analyzing data from a table that includes information about animals, in this case, penguins, such as their names, ages, heights, and weights. You must interpret this data with precision, drawing comparisons and parallels where needed. When counting specific categories of data, pay close attention to the exact specifications of the question. For example, if a question calls for the count of penguins "older than 5 years", you should not include penguins that are of exact age 5 in your total.

Be alert to any changes in the data table such as additions or deletions, and revise your interpretations accordingly. In cases where a question necessitates ordering or listing data, thoroughly understand the requirements. "Alphabetically first" refers to the name that would be first in an alphabetical listing (closer to 'A'), and "alphabetically last" refers to the name that would be last (closer to 'Z'). Maintain a similar understanding for chronological order, with oldest coming first and newest last.

Your focus should remain strictly on the relevant data when questions pertain to multiple disciplines. Finally, conclude your answer by stating your conclusion, then enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> for emphasis. Before you present your final answer, recheck all data, especially named entities, and reassess your understanding of the question and its requirements. Ensure you conduct complete spelling check, not just the first letter, for alphabetically ordered questions. This will avoid any errors in alphabetical order comparisons. Hence, accuracy is of utmost importance and each prompt should be treated as a unique query requiring your utmost attentiveness.

   prompt: Your task is to meticulously analyze and respond to questions based on a data table containing diverse information, such as names, ages, heights, and weights of various animals - penguins in this scenario. The queries will require you to interpret, compare, and contrast the information provided. When counting certain types of data, adhere strictly to the question's defined parameters. For instance, if asked to count penguins "older than 5 years", it means penguins that are exactly 5 years old should not be included. 

Update your count in response to any changes in the data table, such as additions or deletions. In scenarios where data ordering or listing is required, comprehend fully the scope of the assignment. For queries asking for the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, the term 'alphabetically first' means the name that comes first in an A-Z order (like 'Adam' would be first among 'Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl') and 'alphabetically last' refers to the one closest to 'Z' in an A-Z order (like 'Carl' would be last among 'Adam', 'Ben', 'Carl'). For ordering data chronologically, always remember the oldest comes first and the newest comes last.

If you come across any multidisciplinary information, concentrate solely on the data relevant to the question. Upon answering each query, clearly state the correct answer, differentiate your final answer using <answer> at the beginning and </answer> at the end. Always ensure your understanding of key terms and instructions of the question before providing your final answer. 

Recheck your work - your answer should not be based on the order of the options provided but on the instructions given in the query. For example, for 'alphabetically last', do not merely select the last name on the list, but decide based on the alphabetically last name among all options.

   prompt: In the following task, you will analyze table data related to various subjects, such as names, ages, heights and weights of different species like penguins or giraffes. Fluent understanding of alphabetic sequencing and numerical comparisons is crucial for accurately answering based on the presented data. If asked to count, follow the directives strictly and only include or exclude data as explicitly outlined. For instance, when the question specifies "more than 5 years old", it distinctly means older than 5 years, thus do not count those that are exactly 5 years old. Remember this numerical specificity in all cases, whenever ages or other numerals are implicated. When dealing with alphabetical order, attention to the entire name is crucial, not just the first letter. Adhere to the standard sequence of the alphabet unless stated otherwise. To clarify, when asked about the first or the last in alphabetical order, "first" means the name that's alphabetically the closest to 'A', and "last" indicates that name which is alphabetically the closest to 'Z'. This concept doesn't consider the position of the names after arranging in alphabetical order. If the tables involve data related to more than one category or species, filter your focus on the table or tables that pertain to the specific question asked. Always update your total count understanding when a new entity is added or removed. Finally, wrap the correct answer between <answer> and </answer> tags for clear visibility. Your answer should not be a sentence but the actual answer between these tags.

   prompt: In this task, you will be given various table data with diverse categories such as names, ages, heights, and weights of certain species like penguins or giraffes. Respond to queries based on the data in these tables by carefully analyzing, interpreting, and comparing the presented information. 

Adhere strictly to all directives, especially when counting items. When the question calls for a count based on specific criteria, such as "more than 5 years old", avoid counting those that do not meet the precise criteria. For instance, in this scenario, you should not include those that are exactly 5 years old. 

Remember to adjust your understanding of the total count whenever a new entity is added or removed from the table. This adjustment is critical to maintaining accurate responses to questions requiring count information. For example, if a new penguin is added to the table, the total count of penguins should be increased by one.

Alphabetical ordering of names also holds importance. When asked to order or list names alphabetically, concentrate on comparing the whole name, not just the first letter. Follow the standard alphabetical order, considering all the letters in the names sequentially. If a question asks about the "first" or "last" in alphabetical order, interpret "first" as closest to 'A' in the alphabet and "last" as closest to 'Z', unless otherwise stated.

Some tasks will involve tables related to more than one category or species. In these cases, concentrate your attention on the table, or tables, that are relevant to the question asked. Don't mix up data between different tables.

Lastly, ensure that your answers are clear and precise. Highlight the correct answer by enclosing it between <answer> and </answer> tags for identification. Do remember that accuracy in following these guidelines and directions is crucial for precise responses.

We believe that involving these improvements will help you comprehend and respond to these types of tasks in a more efficacious manner. Keep these guidelines in your mind as you respond to each part of the problem

For multiple-choice queries, provide the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.) without any additional explanations. Format your response within <answer> and </answer>, ensuring no syntax errors. Explain your approach in achieving the final answer for transparency, and verify your findings to minimize errors. Remember, any changes to the table, such as adding or deleting rows, will influence the total count, so consider this when responding. Stick to the conditions in the questions when formulating your answer. Your answers should comply with the formatting instructions and accurately represent the question's content.

   prompt: Carefully review and analyze the provided table(s) showcasing data about different animals (age, height, and weight). Note that each row in the table represents an individual animal, and every animal must be considered in your analysis. If updates to the tables occur, including additions or deletions, make sure to include these changes in your examination of the data. Interpret the conditions within the questions carefully—'more than 5' solely signifies values exceeding 5, excluding 5 and any value below it. If multiple tables are presented, evaluate the data from each table individually prior to combining the information. Clearly identify the table(s) specifically mentioned in the context of the question. Utilize your analysis to answer the questions, bearing in mind all details found within the question. If a question necessitates sorting, such as alphabetical sorting, it means arranging from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label without extra explanations (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). When dealing with sorting questions, especially when the term 'last' is used in questions after sorting, it indicates the final position in a sorted sequence, not the original sequence in the table. Frame your response accurately within <answer> and </answer>, being cautious for syntax errors. Detail your thought process step by step to reach the final answer, which allows a clear understanding of your method. Recheck all your findings before arriving at the final answer to avoid mistakes or oversight. Be aware that updates to the table, such as the addition or removal of rows, alter the total count and should be accounted for in your response. Ensure to follow the conditions provided within the questions when constructing your answer. Your answers should satisfy both the formatting requirements and the question's content accurately.

   prompt: Thoroughly examine the data present in the table(s) pertaining to various animals such as age, height, and weight. Should there be any updates in the data, adapt your analysis accordingly. Grasp the exact conditions specified in the question - Interpret phrases like 'more than 5' to mean exclusively numbers greater than 5, absolutely not including 5 or any numbers less than 5. For example, an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Conversely, when the question specifies 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', that allows for the inclusion of the number 5 in your count, but in cases of 'more than', strictly exclude the number 5. Handle edge cases carefully, especially when a value corresponds to the boundary condition, unless the question explicitly asks you to factor it in. When dealing with multiple tables, commence your analysis by scrutinizing each table individually before your merge the insights. Identify the relevant table(s) by using the context presented in the question. Use this meticulous analysis to respond to the questions, keeping every detail present in the question in mind. If the question asks for ordering, such as alphabetical order, interpret it as sorting from A to Z. For multiple-choice questions, provide merely the label of the correct option (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Frame your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags ensuring there are no syntax errors. Explain your solution process for transparency and auditing purposes. Reexamine your results before finalizing the answer to avoid common errors or oversights. Bear in mind that each row in the table(s) denotes a unique entity (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.) - be careful to consider all such entities when formulating your answer. Remember, conforming to the specific conditions given in the questions is of the utmost importance.

   prompt: Perform thorough and detailed analysis of the data provided in the table(s) concerning various animals (age, height, weight). Remain vigilant for any updates or changes in the data, if provided subsequently. Stress upon understanding the specific conditions of the question - In particular, terms such as 'more than 5' strictly denote the values greater than 5 only, never including 5 or any values less than 5. Be certain that an animal of exact 5 years should not be incorporated in your count for 'more than' conditions. For conditions mentioning 'at least' or 'more than or equal to', you could accommodate 5, but for 'more than', exclude the value of 5. Mindfully deal with edge cases where a value equals the boundary condition, unless otherwise specified in the question. In scenarios involving multiple tables, dissect the data for each table individually initially before assimilating the information. Identify the correct table(s) pertaining to the question's context. Use this comprehensive analysis to solve the questions, taking every single detail in the question into account. If the question necessitates arranging some data in order, such as alphabetical ordering, perceive it as ordering from A to Z, with 'last' indicating the end of this alphabetical order. For multiple-choice questions, provide only the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Ensure your response is enveloped between <answer> and </answer> tags, free from any syntactic errors. Elucidate your calculated method towards arriving at the answer to uphold the transparency of your response. Revisit your findings before finalizing the answer to minimize potential errors or overlook. Don't overlook that each row in the table(s) signifies a distinct entity (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.), so always incorporate all such entities when formulating your answer. Above all, remember that abiding by the exact conditions given in the questions is essential and plays a vital role in delivering correct responses.

   prompt: Carefully examine the data shared in the tables featuring information about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay alert for any alterations or updates to the provided data. It's vital to comprehend correctly the parameters of the question - For instance, 'more than 5' expressly excludes the value 5 and includes only the values strictly greater than 5. A perfect embodiment of this would be an animal of exactly 5 years old, which should not be included in this assessment. The condition 'at least' refers to 5 or more, including 5, unlike 'more than' which strictly excludes 5. Strategically handle edge cases, particularly where a figure equals the boundary condition, unless directly specified otherwise in the question. When examining multiple tables, initially scrutinize each table's data independently prior to integrating the information. Ascertain the particular table(s) based on the question's context. Utilize this comprehensive analysis to answer the questions, considering each and every detail mentioned in the question. In case of an ordering requirement, such as alphabetical, view it as ordering from A-Z. For multiple-choice questions, peruse each option carefully before zeroing in on the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Insert <answer> and </answer> tags to frame your response, ensuring it's free of syntactic errors. Transparency is key, ensure you articulate your method to reach the answer in order to clarify your approach. Re-examine your findings before locking in your final answer to circumvent errors or oversights. Acknowledge that each row in the table symbolizes a unique creature (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.), and consider all such entities while drafting your solution. Compliance with the conditions laid out in the questions is non-negotiable and of paramount importance. Verify the direct data given in the question again if necessary and consider all the data provided, including all the multiple-choice options before you finalize your answer.
