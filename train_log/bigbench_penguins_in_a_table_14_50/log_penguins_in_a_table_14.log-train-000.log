gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the mistake the model makes is a simple counting error. There are only 5 animals (penguins and giraffes together) that are more than 5 years old, but the model predicts 7. This seems to be a calculation error rather than a problem with understanding the question or the prompt. But the issue could be the ambiguity in the task "answer questions about causal attribution" - that doesn't necessarily mean to analyze and count information in a table.

<2> 
Again, this error seems to be more of a calculation mistake rather than a misunderstanding. The prompt asks how many penguins are less than 8 years old. The model correctly identifies that there are 2 such penguins: Louis and Bernard, but fails to account for the part of the prompt that states that Bernard is removed from the table. This seems to be an error in following the steps of the prompt, and not necessarily misunderstanding the question.

<3> 
The task prompt is right, "answer questions about causal attribution". But the model makes mistake by counting 4 penguins more than 5 years old. In the table, there are only 3 penguins more than 5 years old: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen.

Reasons why prompt leads to the wrong answer:

1. The model is having trouble performing count operations correctly.
2. The model is not adequately integrating all aspects of the question. It failed to consider when Bernard was removed from the table.
3. The task descriptor of "causal attribution" might be confusing the model to find causal relationships rather than straightforward number comparisons or count operations.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Make it clearer that the task requires numerical comparison and analysis. For example, "Provide answers to questions regarding numerical comparisons based on the data in the provided tables".
2. Ask explicitly for considering all changes to the tables.
3. Use a different task descriptor instead of "Answer questions about causal attribution", which might lead the model toward searching for causal relationships rather than performing calculations and comparisons. For instance, use "Analyze and answer questions based on table data" which encourages the model to focus more on data analysis.
4. It might be helpful to instruct the model to track changes in tables across the prompt.

gradient:
Example Analysis:

In this example, there are no questions about causal attribution. Instead, the task is alphabetically sorting giraffe names and identifying the last one in the alphabetical order. Here, the model has to perform a linguistic task that is in no way related to causal attribution. Hence, model's response is incorrect because the task does not match the prompt.

Reasons for Incorrect Response:

1. Irrelevant Prompt: The task at hand does not have any relation to causal attribution. There is absolutely no question about causality for the model to answer.

2. Mismatched Task: The task is about sorting names in alphabetical order and identifying the last name. This is a linguistic task which is unrelated to causal attributions.

3. Out Of Scope: Since the model is trained to answer questions about causal attribution, it's equipped to understand cause-and-effect relationships and not trained to deal with linguistic tasks such as alphabetical sorting.

Improvement aspects for the prompt:

1. Appropriate Task: Ensure that the task in your prompt is appropriate for the type of AI model you are using. If you're using an AI model designed to answer questions about causal attribution, ensure that your task involves questions about possible causes and effects.

2. Clear Instructions: Make sure to provide clear and explicit instructions in your prompt. This makes it easier for the model to understand and execute the task at hand.

3. Relevant Input: The provided input must be relevant to the task. In this case, tables with names and physiognomy are not relevant to causal attribution. If the task is about causal attribution, the given data and question should be reflective of cause-and-effect relationship.

4. Specificity: The prompts and examples should precisely reflect the nature of the task at hand. Here, the ask is not specific to the theme of causal attribution. 

By addressing these aspects, we can improve the effectiveness of the prompt and consequently the model’s performance.

The question asked in this example is not related to causal attribution but rather a comprehension question based on the given table. Given the model is primed for causal attribution, it may not be paying as much attention to the specific details in the table it needs to, leading it to count incorrectly. 

<2> 
Similar to the first example, the model is not answering the question correctly because it again seems to be referencing all the penguins rather than considering that Bernard was removed from the list. This is another comprehension task error unrelated to assessing causal attribution.

From these examples, it appears the model is struggling with the following:
- It's not understanding the table/data accurately: Despite the statistics of each animal being clearly listed, the model is not correctly identifying and counting the animals that meet certain criteria, such as age.
- Comprehension of the whole text: The model fails to understand that the penguin named Bernard has been deleted from the list and should no longer be considered. 

For improvement:
1. Prime the model for the task it will actually need to accomplish: In this instance, the model needs to comprehend and analyze tables more than it needs to consider causal attribution.
2. Incorporate prompts that encourage accuracy in statistical interpretation and text comprehension.
3. Ensure the model has an understanding of sequential actions within a text, in this case recognizing when an element in the table has been removed.
4. Instead of a general prompt, use more specific prompts related to the task, like "Analyze the given table to answer the following questions".

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> In this example, the language model is asked to analyze the given table and provide responses to the following questions. The issue here is the question asked, "What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?". 

The prompt does not provide clear instructions on whether the model should sort the data using its processing capabilities or based on given information. The model predicted (D) Donna as the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, as Donna was last in the appearance order in the table, rather than last in the alphabetical order.

This suggests that the model might have interpreted the instructions as asking about the last giraffe listed in the table. Another reason could be that the model lacks the explicit instruction to perform the sort operation on the given data. The prompt should be more precise about the action to be taken by the model.

Aspects for Improvement:

1. Specify that the model should analyze the table properly and some actions might need to be performed, like sorting data, comparison, etc.

2. If you require the model to reshuffle the values, make sure to address this explicitly in the prompt.

3. Also ensure to mention that the response should follow the answer presentation format given in the prompt.

Improved Prompt:
Analyze the given table thoroughly and perform any necessary actions like sorting or comparing values to answer the following questions. At the end, your response should bracket the answer option between <answer> and </answer>.

<1> 
In this example, the language model provided the correct answer in its response, so the error might be a simple misclassification on the prediction stage, possibly due to encoding/labeling issues or some random error in the model's decision-making process. It seems there was a mismatch between the model’s prediction and the correct label, even though the right answer was provided in the response.

<2> 
In this example, the model made an error because it did not properly account for the sentence "We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table." This instruction requires the model to update the source of information (table) that it's utilizing for understanding and responding to the subsequent question. The language model may have difficulty integrating this type of mid-way changes/updates into its analysis and answer generation process.

<3> 
In this example, the model was not able to correctly analyze the giraffe table and reach the correct answer, which was two (Gladys and Donna). It seems to have incorrectly included Jody who was exactly 5 years old, but not "more than 5 years old". This suggests that the model may be struggling with precise interpretation of inequalities (greater than, less than, and so on).

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Clarity and Precision: Make sure the equations and comparisons used in the question are clear and precise. For example, specify whether the age limits include the mentioned age or not.

2. Intermediate Changes: Since the model can miss the changes in the data source, updates to the problem situation should be explicitly highlighted or repeated in the question. For instance, instead of stating the deletion instruction midway, it could be reiterated in the question e.g., "After deleting Bernard, how many penguins...".

3. Expectations: Make sure it’s explicitly mentioned what the model should do in each stage of the task. For instance, specify that the model should bracket the answer options after providing a comprehensive response to help avoid prediction-label mismatches.

4. Labeling Instruction: Double-check to ensure the labeling instruction is correctly presented to the model so that the model's prediction matches the correct answer label.

5. Context: Although not evident from the errors, be sure to provide as much useful context as possible. If additional information (like other possible features of the penguins or giraffes) can help the model, be sure to include these in the prompt.

gradient:
<1> 
In this question, it seems like the model correctly analyzed the data and found the correct number of animals that are more than 5 years old. However, the model predicted the wrong answer, most likely because it misread the options. It should have specified the correct answer as (B) 6, since 6 animals were named, but the model selected (C) 7. This suggests that there was a semantic discord in comprehending "answer" from among the provided options.

<2> 
In this question, the model also provided the wrong answer. It seems as though the model failed to take into account the deletion of the penguin named Bernard from the table. Although the initial analysis correctly found two penguins less than 8 years old, the correct answer after Bernard's removal should have been (A) 1. This error appears to be due to the model's inability to incorporate changes in data structure into its analysis process.

<3> 
This last case suggests that the model is having trouble correctly counting the number of items in the table. Although the answer was stated to be a count of the total number of penguins, the model seems to be off by one, giving the answer as (D) 4 when the correct answer should have been (E) 5. This error could stem from an indexing error, or it could be due to confusion over whether the header line should be counted as a separate item.

Based on these mistakes, the following aspects need to be considered for improving the prompt:

1. Semantic Precision: Make sure the language model understands that the answer should be selected from the provided options, not calculated based on the contents of the task.

2. Dynamic Analysis: Make sure the model is capable of updating its analysis when provided with changes (subtractions or additions) to the initial data structure. A prompt can be added to notify the model of such changes and ask it to re-analyse the given data.

3. Clear Counting Instructions: It seems the model has an issue with correctly enumerating items, perhaps due to confusion regarding the header line's inclusion. It will be beneficial to clarify in the prompt that the header line does not count as an item or penguin.

4. Context: Ensure the model considers the bottom-to-top content while predicting its answer.

In summary, the improved prompt could be: "Analyze the given table and consider any changes made to it. Pick your answer from the provided options, ensuring to exclude the header line in the count if the task requires it."

Therefore, the answer is <D>4</D>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this question, it seems like the model correctly analyzed the data and found the correct number of animals that are more than 5 years old. However, the model predicted the wrong answer, most likely because it misread the options. It should have specified the correct answer as (B) 6, since 6 animals were named, but the model selected (C) 7. This suggests that there was a semantic discord in comprehending "answer" from among the provided options.

<2> 
In this question, the model also provided the wrong answer. It seems as though the model failed to take into account the deletion of the penguin named Bernard from the table. Although the initial analysis correctly found two penguins less than 8 years old, the correct answer after Bernard's removal should have been (A) 1. This error appears to be due to the model's inability to incorporate changes in data structure into its analysis process.

<3> 
This last case suggests that the model is having trouble correctly counting the number of items in the table. Although the answer was stated to be a count of the total number of penguins, the model seems to be off by one, giving the answer as (D) 4 when the correct answer should have been (E) 5. This error could stem from an indexing error, or it could be due to confusion over whether the header line should be counted as a separate item.

Based on these mistakes, the following aspects need to be considered for improving the prompt:

1. Semantic Precision: Make sure the language model understands that the answer should be selected from the provided options, not calculated based on the contents of the task.

2. Dynamic Analysis: Make sure the model is capable of updating its analysis when provided with changes (subtractions or additions) to the initial data structure. A prompt can be added to notify the model of such changes and ask it to re-analyse the given data.

3. Clear Counting Instructions: It seems the model has an issue with correctly enumerating items, perhaps due to confusion regarding the header line's inclusion. It will be beneficial to clarify in the prompt that the header line does not count as an item or penguin.

4. Context: Ensure the model considers the bottom-to-top content while predicting its answer.

In summary, the improved prompt could be: "Analyze the given table and consider any changes made to it. Pick your answer from the provided options, ensuring to exclude the header line in the count if the task requires it."

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many penguins are less than 8 years old, we need to look at the age column in the table. 

Before the changes, there were 4 penguins in the table:
- Louis, age 7
- Bernard, age 5
- Vincent, age 9
- Gwen, age 8

After adding James and deleting Bernard, the penguins in the table are:
- Louis, age 7
- Vincent, age 9

- James, age 12

From the updated table, we can see that there are 2 penguins (Louis and Bernard) who are less than 8 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?

Wrong prediction: The answer is (B) 2.

The model makes a mistake by counting Bernard, who was removed from the original table, and overlooks James who was added. The model correctly identifies the age of penguins but fails to accurately apply these data changes to its assessment. 

Error Analysis:
1) Data updates: The model was instructed to note any updates or changes in the data, but it did not correctly adjust for the addition and removal of penguins from the table. In its response, it counted Bernard, who had been removed.
   
2) Question comprehension: While the model correctly extracted the ages of the penguins, it didn't apply this information properly to answer the question about penguins "less than 8 years old". The model does not offer clear reasoning as to why it included Bernard, whose data should have been deleted, and did not include newly added penguin James. 

Based on the above, the following aspects can improve the prompt:
1) Clarify data updates: Ensure that the model recognizes and correctly applies changes in the data to its assessment. For example, when data is added or deleted, the model should reflect these changes in its answer.
2) Improve question comprehension: The model needs to understand and interpret the question correctly. When asked for a count of a specific subset (in this case, penguins less than 8 years old), the model must use all the relevant information provided and apply it accurately to reach the correct conclusion.
3) Ensure model uses all relevant answers: The model needs to ensure that it checks all the possible options in the answers, not just an assumed subset. In the example, the model ignored option A even though it was a valid answer.
4) Better instructions: The prompt should emphasize that the model needs to adapt to changes in the data and precisely follow the requirements of the question to provide the correct answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in both tables.

In the penguin table, we have Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). So, there are 3 penguins that are more than 5 years old.

In the giraffe table, we have Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), Marian (2 years old), and Donna (9 years old). So, there are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old.

Adding the number of penguins and giraffes that are more than 5 years old, we get a total of 6 animals.

Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1: 

Question:
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
 
Model's Response:
Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The model has made an error in the interpretation of the phrase "more than 5 years old". The instructions are clear that the model is supposed to identify the animals that are over 5 years old, not ones that are 5 or older. It has incorrectly included Bernard and Jody who are exactly 5 years old. As a result, the model should have calculated only 2 penguins (Louis and Gwen) and 2 giraffes (Gladys and Donna), giving a total of 4 animals and therefore, answer (A) should have been selected, not (B). 

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:
1. Ambiguity in Question Interpretation: The model misinterpreted the question, not accounting for the exact wording which asked for animals more than 5 years old. 

Prompt Improvements:
1. Include an explicit instruction for the model to pay attention to the exact words and their meaning in the question as "more than 5" doesn't include 5.
2. Ask the model to verify its interpretation of the question before answering.
3. Emphasize the need for careful analysis of data and thorough understanding of the context.
4. Explicitly tell the model to make sure not to include the borderline cases when dealing with more or less than questions. 

The improved prompt could be:

"Examine the data in the provided tables, taking note of updates or changes. Pay attention to the specific wording and meaning of the question, and ensure you correctly interpret what is being asked before you begin your analysis. Do pay attention if the question excludes the borderline cases in 'more than' or 'less than' phrases. Provide a comprehensive response that includes your analysis process and a clear conclusion.

gradient:
<1> 

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Wrong Answer: Donna

Reasons:

1. Misinterpretation of the question: The question asks about the last giraffe in alphabetical order, not the first. However, the model seems to interpret the question as asking for the first giraffe in alphabetical order. The model should understand that "sorted by alphabetic order" means naming the giraffe whose name comes last in alphabetic order (in this case, 'Marian'). 

2. Incorrect calculation: Alphabetically, the name ‘Marian’ comes last and not ‘Donna’ as claimed by the model. When sorted alphabetically – ‘Donna,’ ‘Gladys,’ ‘Marian,’ and ‘Jody,’ the name ‘Marian’ is last. 
 
Based on these reasons, the model’s response could be improved in the following ways:

1. Clear instruction on sorting order: The prompt should include instructions about sorting order. Explain that when a question refers to 'last' in 'sorted by alphabetical order,' the answer should be the element that would appear at the end of the alphabetized list, not at the start.

2. Error handling: The prompt should encourage the model to double-check its final answer before indicating it, as it has made an error in its calculation here.

3. Encouragement to answer correctly: The model should align the answer with the question properly. For the task like sorting out names in alphabetical order, the model should make sure that it is answering with the name that comes last alphabetically, not the first.

4. Vocabulary emphasis: The prompt should highlight the importance of understanding and handling key words in the questions, such as 'alphabetic order' and 'last'. This could help the model to come up with a precise response.

In conclusion, to improve the prompt, it should direct the model to demonstrably sort and understand the parameters of the problem, to accurately interpret critical words in the question and to properly align its final answer with the question.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are there in the tables?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are four giraffes in the tables. (D) <answer>4</answer>

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: N/A: Format error.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Examining the wrong example:

Wrong Example: 

The language model is required to provide the answer in a format that includes the answer option, but the chatbot has only given the numeric answer, ignoring the corresponding answer option in the choices given, i.e., (D) should be part of the answer.

The language model seems to have gotten confused with the prompt's requirements due to its complex instructions. It correctly figured out that it was supposed to analyze the tables and answer the question, but it failed to properly interpret and adhere to the instructions about the specific format requested for the final answer.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer: 

1. Ambiguous Prompt: The chatbot might not have a clear understanding of how to encapsulate the answer according to the instructions provided. The part of the prompt asking to put the answer between <answer> and </answer> tags is clear, but the instruction about including the answer option from the given choices might need more explicit wording.

2. Format Misunderstanding: The instructions might be too complex for the machine to follow accurately without more specific guidance.

3. Lack of Contextual Interpretation: The AI might not infer that the identifier (D) has to be included as part of the answer.

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:

1. Simplify Instructions: More straightforward instructions would be beneficial to assist the model in understanding what is required.

2. Provide Specific Guidelines: Explicitly mention that the answer should include the option's identifier.

3. An example in the prompt would clarify expectations about the answer's format.

4. Instead of all the instructions presented at once, a step-by-step approach could make it easier for the AI to correctly complete the task. 

Revised Prompt: 

"Analyze the information given in the provided tables thoroughly. Make sure you understand the question, especially if it includes 'more than' or 'less than' conditions. Provide a detailed explanation of your analysis and choose the correct option from the available choices. Your answer should include both the number and the alphabet identifier from the provided options. For example, if you think the answer is 4 and this corresponds to option (D) from the given choices, write your answer as (D) 4. Enclose your final answer in the tags <answer> and </answer>. It is essential to ensure that the answer adheres to this format and accurately reflects your analysis."

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620

Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically.

The names in the giraffe table are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna.

Sorting these names alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is (D) Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D)</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Looking at the first example, the error made by the model seems to be based on a misunderstanding of the question. The question asks for the last giraffe when sorted by alphabetic order. While the model does correctly sort the names alphabetically (Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian), it selects the first name instead of the last. This suggests that the model may have misunderstood the part "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" to mean the first name when arranged in order.

A plausible reason could be that the prompt did not explicitly state the difference between "first" and "last" when talking about sorted order. In a sorted list, "first" is often associated with the beginning and "last" with the end. However, the model seems to consider "last" as the first name in the list. This could be because of the lack of clear instruction on how to handle sorted data in the prompt.

Therefore, the first aspect for improvement could be for the prompt to clearly mention that in a sorted list, the "first" should be considered the beginning, and the "last" should be considered the end of the list.

Also, the prompt in the current form is quite verbose, potentially diluting the clarity of critical instructions that drive the analysis. Simplifying this text might improve comprehension.

Additionally, the correction process used in the prompt could be made more explicit. While it currently advises the language model to "ensure that [the] selected final answer from the provided options aligns with the result of [the] analysis", it could stress double-checking and arguing why a certain option (answer) is chosen.

Finally, it would be beneficial to instruct the model to critically assess the terminology used in the question, for example, terms like 'more than', 'less than', 'first', 'last', etc., and apply the appropriate logical approach based on these terms. In this specific scenario, clear guidance on interpreting and applying the term 'last' in the context of an ordered list would have helped in providing the correct answer.

To summarize, the prompt can be enhanced by:
1. Explicitly stating that "first" and "last" in sorted data should correspond to the beginning and end of the list respectively.
2. Simplifying and reducing verbosity to enhance critical instruction comprehension.
3. Emphasizing a thorough double-checking process and elaboration on the reasoning behind the selected answer.
4. Instructing the model to take special consideration of certain specific terminologies used in the question and adjust the approach based on them.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650

Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically. The names in the giraffe table are Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna. Sorting these names alphabetically, we get Donna as the last name.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna. Hence, the answer is:
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

The task at hand requires the AI to sort names of giraffes in alphabetic order and find the last name. The correct answer is (C) Marian considering the description. But somehow, the model gave (D) Donna as the last name in alphabetic order, which is incorrect. This mistake happened probably because the AI mistaken 'last' as last in the list, not in terms of alphabetic order.

Reason for the incorrect answer:

1- Misinterpretation of Task: The AI might have misconstrued the term 'last' as final in a sequence, thereby sorting the names and picking the last one, which is Donna. However, in the context of the question, 'last' actually referred to the final one when arranged in alphabetical order.

2- Lack of Proper Instructions: While writing the prompt, there was no explicit instruction to guide the AI to consider 'last' in alphabetic order.

Suggestions to improve the prompt:

1- Include Explicit Instructions: To avoid confusion for terms that could be perceived in multiple ways, it would be helpful to explicitly define these terms in the prompt. For instance, 'last in alphabetic order' would make more sense in this context.

2- Clarify Default Meaning of Words: In brief, explain the default method to handle words with multiple interpretations in the given context.

3- Prioritize Context: Ask the AI to consider every aspect of the question and the data provided. Must focus on the context rather than interpreting words in their general meaning.

Revised Prompt: 

Analyze the data from the given tables. Update and tag any shifts or alterations in the given data set. In each question, pay close attention to its exact wording and construct a comprehensive response that includes an analysis process, conclusion, and any possible details that might impact the results. Be aware of ambiguous phrases and dissect their meaning based on the context. Please bear in mind that your answer options might contain choices not directly mentioned in the data, so examine them meticulously. When you reach an appropriate answer, indicate it by enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in both tables. 

In the penguin table, we have Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). Out of these, Louis, Vincent, and Gwen are more than 5 years old, so there are 3 penguins that are more than 5 years old.

In the giraffe table, we have Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), Marian (2 years old), and Donna (9 years old). Out of these, Gladys, Donna, and Jody are more than 5 years old, so there are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old.

Adding the number of penguins and giraffes that are more than 5 years old, we get a total of 6 animals.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
<1> 
This question has one mistake: the model misinterpreted the age criterion as "more than or equal to 5 years old" instead of "more than 5 years old". Bernard the Penguin and Jody the Giraffe are both 5 years old, which means they should not have been included in the count. The correct number of animals that are more than 5 years old is 4, but this option is not listed among the answer choices. Thus, the model should have indicated that none of the options are correct. 

Reasons: 
1. The prompt could have been misinterpreted by the model leading to an incorrect calculation of ages. It seems like the model didn't understand "more than 5 years old" and processed the condition like "5 years old or more than 5". 
2. There may be a lack of understanding about the fact that the provided answer options might not always be correct and that the task can involve eliminating all of the options rather than just selecting one of them. 

Improvements: 
1. The prompt needs to provide explicit instruction to the model so it can understand the need to consider 'None of the above' as a viable answer, especially when none of the given options match the correct answer. 
2. The request could include specific instructions regarding the interpretation of comparative phrases, such as "more than".
3. We could specify that the comparison "more than 5 years old" does not include those of exactly 5 years old. 
4. The prompt also needs to be clearer on validating the correct label given with the calculated one. It seems that the model didn't verify its final calculated label (6) with the correct answer (None of the above).

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically.

The names in the giraffe table are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna.

Sorting these names alphabetically, we get: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is (D) Donna.

<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

In this case, the model correctly analysed the given data and sorted the names alphabetically. However, there's an unnoticed detail that led to the wrong answer, which is the presence of an option not listed in the data: (E) Louise. 

The error seems to arise from not adhering to one specific piece of the prompt: "your answer options might contain options not explicitly listed in the data." Although the model was asked to consider this, it did not take into account the name 'Louise' as a potential answer.

Thus, the misunderstanding stems from not considering all answer options listed under the prompt, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the dataset. This oversight leads to a miscalculation, with the model overlooking the answer option (E) Louise, which alphabetically comes last, and incorrectly marking (D) Donna as the answer.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Unambiguous Explanation: Make sure the model recognises that all answer options should be considered valid possibilities, regardless of whether they exist within the given data or not. Make this explicitly clear in the instructions.

2. Implement Option Validity: The model should recognise and consider answer options not explicitly listed in the data. The prompt should reinforce the notion that all provided options are valid and need to be considered.

3. Enhanced Sorting Mechanism: The model should be able to sort all options, rather than just the ones present in the provided dataset.

4. Reinforce Checks: A stronger emphasis on the importance of cross-checking the final result with the options provided in the prompt.

From these improvements, the updated prompt should include stronger reinforcement that all answer options must be considered and analysed further, even those not present in the dataset. The model should cross-verify the result with all possible options before concluding an answer, ensuring a meticulous and accurate analysis process.

gradient:
For Example 1:
The problem with the current prompt here is that it overly encourages the AI to consider options not mentioned directly in the data. The question being asked is directly related to the data, as "Louis" is a famous jazzman (Louis Armstrong). However, the language of the prompt, emphasizing scrutiny of all the answer options, even those not mentioned in the data, might have redirected the AI to the choice of "James" which is a common name linked with many famous figures in jazz.

But, the correct choice should be (A) "Louis", because the data shows a penguin named Louis and Louis Armstrong is a famous jazz musician also. This shows that the AI model may not have knowledge about famous jazz musicians, or it has misinterpreted the instructions to mean that the correct answer cannot be in the given data. This is a misinterpretation of the prompt's instruction to "please remember that the answer options may include choices not directly mentioned in the data or question."

To improve the prompt, a line can be clarified to suggest that while some answers may lie outside the dataset, it is still essential to relate the question’s demands to the dataset provided. Perhaps something like this: "Carefully analyze the dataset, as the answer might lie within it or be inferable from it. However, also bear in mind that some answer options may still be valid even if they are not derived directly from the dataset.”

By doing this, the AI will be instructed to refer back to the dataset more carefully before considering options not found within the data. The AI model needs to remain focused on the specific context and asks of the question even when exploring beyond the dataset.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically. 

The names in the giraffe table are: Jody, Gladys, Marian, Donna. When sorted alphabetically, the last name is Donna.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is <answer>Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Explanation:

1. Inadequate Clarification of Alphabetic Order: The language model, in this case, seems to have considered conventional alphabetic order (A-Z). However, the question asks for the "last" giraffe in alphabetical order, which could be interpreted as the last one when arranged in reverse alphabetic order (Z-A). Therefore, the model might have assigned the wrong label because it interpreted "last" as last in a list sorted from A-Z, rather than last in a list sorted from Z-A. A more clear articulation of the alphabetical order would be beneficial to prevent such issues.

2. Misinterpretation of "Last" in the Question: The model could have been confused by the word "last" as it could be interpreted both in temporal or positional terms. So while the prompt asked for the last (by alphabetical order) giraffe, the model may have interpreted this as the most recent (temporally last) giraffe, leading to it giving the wrong answer.

3. Ignoring The Answer Options: Another reason could be that the model ignored the answer choices not mentioned in the tables' data. As per the options, Louise could be considered as a giraffe name, but since it wasn't in the provided list, the model disregarded it.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Specify the meaning of "last" clearly. It should explicitly mention if the names should be sorted in A-Z or Z-A order when referring to "last".

2. Include a guideline for the model to ensure the consideration of all the answer options listed, not limited to the data provided in the question.

3. The prompt should further emphasize that ambiguous statements within the question should be interpreted according to their specific context within the question, and not according to their general meaning.

4. The prompt can also reinforce that the task includes assessing the question independently while being mindful of the possible answer options. It should highlight to check back against all possible response choices after conducting the initial analysis.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically. The names in the giraffe table are Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna. Sorting these names alphabetically, we get the order: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian. Therefore, the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is (D) Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Misinterpretation of the question: One of the fundamental mistakes in this instance was the very interpretation of the question. The prompt instructed the language model to "be mindful of any peculiarities or changes that may affect the interpretation of the data", however, the model incorrectly interpreted the task as “the last alphabetically sorted giraffe from given data“, which led to (D) Donna. However, the task was to sort the names in the list and select the option that comes in last place alphabetically. This includes the options not mentioned in the data, including the correct answer option (E) Louise.

2. Incomplete assessment of all answer options: The prompt had required that "all answer options may include choices not directly mentioned in the data or question", therefore every option should be considered before making a selection. The model failed to scrutinize each option thoroughly and did not consider option (E) Louise, which was the correct answer but was not mentioned in the data table.

3. Uncontextual interpretation of ambiguous statements: Although advised that "ambiguous statements within the question should be interpreted contextually rather than according to their general meaning", the model incorrectly assumed that the question referred strictly to the giraffes in the table and neglected to consider the extra option provided in the choices.

Based on these reasons, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

a. Encourage the model to consider all choices provided, including those not explicitly mentioned in the data set.
   
b. Encourage explicit differentiation and interpretation. The model should not assume that the question strictly refers to the entries in the table.

c. Ensure comprehensive analysis: The model needs to conduct thorough scrutiny not only of the given data but also of all the questions and options.

d. Reinforce the implication of figurative language, context, and nuances especially for tasks that involve complex interpretation like sorting or coding. 

The revised prompt could be:
Analyze the data in the provided tables and apply precise interpretation to any linguistic or numeric nuances in the questions. Remember to consider all answer options, including those not mentioned in the data or question. Pay particular attention to potentially ambiguous phrases and interpret these in the context of the specific task. After researching and selecting an answer, clearly indicate it with an <answer> and </answer> tag. Make sure that your final answer is consistent with your detailed explanation and is the best fit within the overall context of the question. 

This prompt still includes comprehensive analysis and cautious interpretation, but more strongly emphasizes the need to consider all answer choices and interpret ambiguities contextually.

Consider the full process of analysis and include a detailed conclusion in your response. Please remember that the answer options may include choices not directly mentioned in the data or question, so each option should be thoroughly scrutinized before making a selection. Ambiguous statements within the question should be interpreted contextually rather than according to their general meaning. Once you have determined the correct answer, indicate it by enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> brackets. Ensure that your final calculated label is consistent with the answer provided in your explanation and with the specific context of the question.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically. The names in the giraffe table are Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna. Sorting these names alphabetically, we get the order: Donna, Gladys, Jody, Marian. Therefore, the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is (D) Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1. Misinterpretation of the question: One of the fundamental mistakes in this instance was the very interpretation of the question. The prompt instructed the language model to "be mindful of any peculiarities or changes that may affect the interpretation of the data", however, the model incorrectly interpreted the task as “the last alphabetically sorted giraffe from given data“, which led to (D) Donna. However, the task was to sort the names in the list and select the option that comes in last place alphabetically. This includes the options not mentioned in the data, including the correct answer option (E) Louise.

2. Incomplete assessment of all answer options: The prompt had required that "all answer options may include choices not directly mentioned in the data or question", therefore every option should be considered before making a selection. The model failed to scrutinize each option thoroughly and did not consider option (E) Louise, which was the correct answer but was not mentioned in the data table.

3. Uncontextual interpretation of ambiguous statements: Although advised that "ambiguous statements within the question should be interpreted contextually rather than according to their general meaning", the model incorrectly assumed that the question referred strictly to the giraffes in the table and neglected to consider the extra option provided in the choices.

Based on these reasons, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

a. Encourage the model to consider all choices provided, including those not explicitly mentioned in the data set.
   
b. Encourage explicit differentiation and interpretation. The model should not assume that the question strictly refers to the entries in the table.

c. Ensure comprehensive analysis: The model needs to conduct thorough scrutiny not only of the given data but also of all the questions and options.

d. Reinforce the implication of figurative language, context, and nuances especially for tasks that involve complex interpretation like sorting or coding. 

The revised prompt could be:
Analyze the data in the provided tables and apply precise interpretation to any linguistic or numeric nuances in the questions. Remember to consider all answer options, including those not mentioned in the data or question. Pay particular attention to potentially ambiguous phrases and interpret these in the context of the specific task. After researching and selecting an answer, clearly indicate it with an <answer> and </answer> tag. Make sure that your final answer is consistent with your detailed explanation and is the best fit within the overall context of the question. 

This prompt still includes comprehensive analysis and cautious interpretation, but more strongly emphasizes the need to consider all answer choices and interpret ambiguities contextually.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

Analysis:

From the examples provided, it’s clear to observe one consistent challenge - the model went off-balance in considering whether to prioritize the information from the table data or the associated queries. Analysing the given problematic instance, the table displays a list of giraffes, however, the model failed to recognize or consider that the options also included a name not listed within the table data - 'Louise'.

The prompt could mislead the model due to a few reasons:

1. There is a strong emphasis on meticulously analysing the data in the table and any shifts or updates in it. This tapers the model's attention heavily towards the table and might lead it to overlooking or downplaying other relevant information such as the listed options or the specifics of the question.
   
2. While there is a statement saying that the "answer options may encompass choices not explicitly included in the data," it is followed by the directive to "incorporate" such options in the analysis where required. This could be misinterpreted by the model as the need to tie every option back to a corresponding data point within the table data, which is irrelevant or incorrect in certain cases.

3. The model might be interpreting the direction of dealing 'specifically' with comparison or exclusion phrases as an indication that numbers are more significant in the analysis, hence it neglects the alphabetical order part in the question.

Improvements Based on Above Analysis:

1. Adjust the emphasis in the prompt from focusing heavily on the table data to a more balanced analysis of the data along with the specifics of the question.

2. Make it clear that some options might not have a direct corresponding element within the table data and that is perfectly acceptable. Add a cue to make it understand that options should be evaluated independently of the data if the question demands it.

3. Include a sentence emphasizing the importance of accurately interpreting all parts of the question, not just numerical or exclusion/comparison phrases, but also the requirement of alphabetical, chronological orders or other specific requirements if present.

4. Prompt the model to reconsider the final calculated answer if any part of the question or provided options have not been addressed or accounted for in the answer.

Understand that while your answer options might include choices not explicitly mentioned in the data, some options might not directly relate to a data point in the table - such options should be evaluated independently if the question calls for it. Exercise specificity when dealing with phrases involving comparison or exclusion, but also focus on requirements of any other nature in the question such as alphabetical or chronological orders. Obscure elements in the question need to be carefully dissected to ensure an accurate understanding. Having done so, determine the accurate answer and indicate it by enclosing it between <answer> and </answer>. Double-check that your final calculated label corresponds with the answer provided in your detailed response. If no provided option matches your calculated answer, write 'None of the above'. Make it a priority to confirm that your solved answer correctly aligns with the right label provided. Reevaluate your calculated answer if any part of the question or options remain unaddressed or unaccounted for in your response.
cur_prompt: Carefully analyze the data in the presented table.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names of the penguins provided in the table. The names listed are Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen. Sorting these names alphabetically, we get Bernard as the last penguin.

Therefore, the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order is Bernard.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) Bernard</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Example
   - Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
   - Wrong Answer: (B) Bernard

Analysis of the wrong answer:
- The model correctly understood the task of sorting the names in alphabetical order but it incorrectly sorted the list. This resulted in the wrong answer of 'Bernard.'
- The model's response indicates that it might not have a complete understanding of how alphabetical sorting works. The correct order should be 'Bernard', 'Gwen', 'Louis', 'Vincent' - and therefore 'Vincent' (C) should be the answer, but it incorrectly identified 'Bernard' as the last name.

2. Suggestions to improve the prompt:
    - The prompt could include a clear explanation that sorting alphabetically is based on the order of characters in the alphabet, where 'A' comes before 'B', 'B' comes before 'C', and so forth.
    - Instead of saying "Check that your calculated label corresponds with the answer provided in your response", the prompt could clarify that the model should ensure its process of determination aligns with correct logic and, if possible, cross-verify its conclusion.
    - In the sentence "Be very specific when dealing with phrases involving comparison or exclusion", adding further clarification to guide the model in sorting and comparison tasks could be helpful.
    - The prompt could explain cultural differences in alphabetical order (for example, the treatment of accents in some languages).
    - The prompt should clearly state the importance of accurate calculations and following instructions accurately for tasks like sorting. 

By taking into account the above aspects, the prompt could provide better guidance to the model, reducing the chances of producing a wrong answer.

The model's response is: 
To determine the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to look at the names in the giraffe table and sort them alphabetically. The names in the giraffe table are Jody, Gladys, Marian, and Donna. Sorting these names alphabetically, we get Donna as the last name.

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) Donna</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1 Analysis:

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Model's Answer: (D) Donna

Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Here, it appears the model has made a mistake while sorting the names alphabetically. The correct alphabetical order of the names is Donna, Gladys, Jody, and Marian, which would make Marian as the last name in the alphabetic order, not Donna. 

Potential Prompt Improvement:

1. The prompt could specify how the language model should process the data. For finding the last name in alphabetical order, specify that the model should sort names starting with the first letter in increasing alphabetical order, then consider the second letter, and continue this process for subsequent letters if required.

2. The prompt could provide clear instructions to the model to consider all the names available in the given table, and remind it not to ignore any names in its process of sorting.

3. The prompt should be clearer about the fact that "more than" does not include the probed number. This example doesn't seem to involve that rule, so it could be confusing.

4. The prompt could instruct the model to check its process of data handling and confirmation of the answer, as it got the correct process but did not arrive at the correct conclusion, possibly due to a data handling error.

5. The prompt should stress the importance of accuracy in data organization and interpretation – in this case, understanding the correct process for alphabetizing names. 

Summary of Improvements:

1. Provide clarity on specific procedures like data sorting.
2. Emphasize checking all data, avoiding ignoring any piece.
3. Clearly state rules related to phrase usage and interpretation.
4. Reiterate the necessity of matching the process with the conclusion.
5. Highlight the importance of accurate data organization and interpretation.

Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Here, it appears the model has made a mistake while sorting the names alphabetically. The correct alphabetical order of the names is Donna, Gladys, Jody, and Marian, which would make Marian as the last name in the alphabetic order, not Donna. 

Potential Prompt Improvement:

1. The prompt could specify how the language model should process the data. For finding the last name in alphabetical order, specify that the model should sort names starting with the first letter in increasing alphabetical order, then consider the second letter, and continue this process for subsequent letters if required.

2. The prompt could provide clear instructions to the model to consider all the names available in the given table, and remind it not to ignore any names in its process of sorting.

3. The prompt should be clearer about the fact that "more than" does not include the probed number. This example doesn't seem to involve that rule, so it could be confusing.

4. The prompt could instruct the model to check its process of data handling and confirmation of the answer, as it got the correct process but did not arrive at the correct conclusion, possibly due to a data handling error.

5. The prompt should stress the importance of accuracy in data organization and interpretation – in this case, understanding the correct process for alphabetizing names. 

Summary of Improvements:

1. Provide clarity on specific procedures like data sorting.
2. Emphasize checking all data, avoiding ignoring any piece.
3. Clearly state rules related to phrase usage and interpretation.
4. Reiterate the necessity of matching the process with the conclusion.
5. Highlight the importance of accurate data organization and interpretation.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
In this case, the model got the answer wrong because it incorrectly stated that the age of Gwen is less than 8 years. Per the data, Gwen is actually 8 years old. Therefore, only one penguin, Louis, qualifies as less than 8 years old. 

The prompt advises the model to "consider the specific wording of each question to understand its exact requirements and constraints." The word "less" does not include "equal to". Therefore, the model misinterpreted the age limit mentioned in the question. 
Reflecting the age of Louis as less than 8 years old, but not considering Gwen because Gwen is exactly 8 years old, the correct answer should be (A) 1.

Aspect 1: The model needs to ensure it thoroughly understands the semantics of comparative language.

Aspect 2: The model should pay close attention to every detail of the question to correctly determine the constraints and conditions outlined.

Aspect 3: The prompt could be improved by emphasizing the need to validate conclusions against the original data and instructions given in the task.

Aspect 4: The model should be checking its answer against all options in the context of the task’s constraints and conditions.

Aspect 5: The model should not assume conditions that may not apply, such as assuming 8 is less than 8, instead of correctly interpreting that 8 is not less than 8.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in both tables.

In the penguin table, there are 4 penguins listed, and 3 of them are more than 5 years old (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen).

In the giraffe table, there are 4 giraffes listed, and 3 of them are more than 5 years old (Jody, Gladys, and Donna).

Therefore, the total number of animals more than 5 years old is 3 + 3 = 6.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
This error occurred because the model incorrectly interpreted the age data in the tables. It correctly identified the animals older than 5 years in each table (three penguins and three giraffes), but it made a mistake when adding them together. The model calculated the sum as 6, whereas it should've been 5 since Louis the penguin and Jody the giraffe both are exactly 5 years old and should not be included. This exhibits that the model did not fully comprehend the specific wording of the question, specifically the phrase "more than 5 years old".

Reasons for error:
1. Lack of comprehension of 'Greater Than' operator: The most salient issue in this instance is the model's inability to accurately apply the 'greater than' operator referred to as 'more than' in the problem statement. The model included animals that were exactly 5 years old, which isn't applicable here. The prompt needs to emphasize more on understanding and correctly applying mathematical operators.
2. Ignored specific wording: The model failed to pay precise attention to the question's specific wording. The model's response didn't indicate that it grasped the meaning of "more than". The prompt should stress the importance of taking into account the specific wording of each question.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Reinforce Mathematical Interpretation: The prompt should stress the significance of accurately interpreting and applying mathematical or relational operators like 'greater than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc.  
2. Emphasise on Question Specifics: It should insist on considering the precise wording of each question, not simply understanding it. There should be a level of granular understanding when interpreting the specifics of the problem statement.
3. Include Keyword Analysis: The prompt could be more explicit about identifying and understanding keywords or expressions in the question that significantly transform the problem's scope, such as 'more than', 'less than', 'not including', 'excluding', etc.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to look at the age column in both tables.

In the penguin table, there are 4 penguins listed, and 3 of them are more than 5 years old (Louis, Vincent, and Gwen).

In the giraffe table, there are 4 giraffes listed, and 3 of them are more than 5 years old (Jody, Gladys, and Donna).

Therefore, the total number of animals more than 5 years old is 3 + 3 = 6.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
This error occurred because the model incorrectly interpreted the age data in the tables. It correctly identified the animals older than 5 years in each table (three penguins and three giraffes), but it made a mistake when adding them together. The model calculated the sum as 6, whereas it should've been 5 since Louis the penguin and Jody the giraffe both are exactly 5 years old and should not be included. This exhibits that the model did not fully comprehend the specific wording of the question, specifically the phrase "more than 5 years old".

Reasons for error:
1. Lack of comprehension of 'Greater Than' operator: The most salient issue in this instance is the model's inability to accurately apply the 'greater than' operator referred to as 'more than' in the problem statement. The model included animals that were exactly 5 years old, which isn't applicable here. The prompt needs to emphasize more on understanding and correctly applying mathematical operators.
2. Ignored specific wording: The model failed to pay precise attention to the question's specific wording. The model's response didn't indicate that it grasped the meaning of "more than". The prompt should stress the importance of taking into account the specific wording of each question.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Reinforce Mathematical Interpretation: The prompt should stress the significance of accurately interpreting and applying mathematical or relational operators like 'greater than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc.  
2. Emphasise on Question Specifics: It should insist on considering the precise wording of each question, not simply understanding it. There should be a level of granular understanding when interpreting the specifics of the problem statement.
3. Include Keyword Analysis: The prompt could be more explicit about identifying and understanding keywords or expressions in the question that significantly transform the problem's scope, such as 'more than', 'less than', 'not including', 'excluding', etc.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong example analysis:

• The model did not accurately interpret the age criteria: The question asked for the number of penguins that are "less than 8" years old. The model incorrectly included the penguin named Gwen, who is 8 years of age, which is not less than 8.

• Misunderstanding of table data after updates: The analytical process should account for changes to the table, updating the working dataset as additions and deletions are made. In this case, the model correctly removed Bernard but incorrectly included Gwen in its count of penguins who are less than 8 years old.

• Incorrect answer selection: As a result of incorrect data interpretation and analysis, the model selected the wrong answer choice. The model identified two penguins less than 8 years old, but there is only one, Louis.

Improvement aspects for the prompt:

1. Clarification on mathematical conditions: The prompt should direct the model to be especially cautious and precise when reading and interpreting mathematical conditions such as 'less than,’ ensuring that they do not confuse it with 'equal to or less than.'

2. Emphasis on accurate dataset analysis: The prompt should emphasize the importance of correctly interpreting the updated table data following all stated changes. This includes, but is not limited to, recognising new entries and accounting for deletions. 

3. Stress on correct final answer alignment: The prompt should make it clear to the model that the final chosen answer should be consistent with the analysis and results of the given question. The model should counter-check its outcome with the given options before making the final selection. 

4. Explicit instruction on careful validation: On the step of answering the question, the model should be guided to validate all potential answers against the findings from its analysis before making the final choice. This double-check mechanism will ensure the selected option aligns with the expectations of the question.

gradient:
<1> 
The question is: "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?" 
The model's incorrect response is: "There are three giraffes who are more than 5 years old: Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), and Donna (9 years old). Therefore, the answer is (C) 3."
The model's mistake here stems primarily from misinterpretation of the question. The model misread "more than 5 years old" as "5 years old or older". Since Jody is exactly 5 years old, she doesn't meet the condition. So, there are only 2 giraffes who are more than 5 years old, Gladys and Donna. The prompt didn't emphasize the need for precise interpretation of conditions - 'more than' should not include the exact age.

<2> 
The question is: "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?" 
The model's incorrect response is: "There are 4 penguins in total, and all of them are more than 5 years old. Therefore, the answer is (D) 4."
Here, the model again makes the error of misinterpreting "more than 5 years old" as "5 years or older". Bernard, being exactly 5, doesn't meet the condition. There are only 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old: Louis, Vincent, and Gwen. The prompt didn't highlight the importance of precise interpretation of question conditions.

<3> 
The question is: "What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?"
The model's incorrect response is: "The last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Jody. Therefore, the answer is (A) Jody."
While the model makes a logical error in its approach to ordering the giraffe names alphabetically. Alphabetical order would put "Marian" as the last in the list, not "Jody". The prompt doesn't emphasize the need to verify and check the information before concluding, especially in the context of order and sequence questions.

In conclusion, the improvement needs for the current prompt are:

1. Emphasize the need for precise interpretation of comparative conditions (e.g., 'more than' should not include the exact quantity).
2. Highlight the importance of verification and double-checking of information, especially for order and sequence-based tasks.
3. Stress on the detailed understanding of each inquiry to interpret its exact requirements and limitations. Model’s responses should respect these boundaries while conducting analysis.
4. Model should understand that every word in the question plays a potential role in formulating the response and hence the need to comprehensively consider all elements of the question. 
5. Recommend the model to consider all response alternatives before formulating an answer, ensuring all possibilities have been explored.

Example 1:

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9
Model's Prediction: (C) 7
Correct Answer: (A) 5

Step-by-step review:
1. The question provides two tables; one consists of 4 penguins and another provides details for 4 giraffes. This totals 8 animals.
2. Out of these 8 animals, only 5 are more than 5 years old (Louis, Bernard, Gwen, Gladys, and Donna).
3. However, the model’s prediction is incorrect because it assumed all 8 animals to be more than 5 years old. 

Reason for Error:
1. This error can be attributed to the verbose and complex instruction set in the prompt. It is possible that the model was overloaded with information and did not fully grasp the request. 
2. The statement, "Your analysis ought to be based on the altered state of data after applying all modifications," in the instructions could likely have confused the model as there were no modifications directed to be made in the data. 

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Simplification of instructions: The language in the current prompt could be more straightforward and easy for the model to comprehend. The instructions should be disambiguated.
2. Specific Directions: We can be explicit about what exactly needs to be identified from the table (in this case, animals over 5 years old).
3. Removal of irrelevant information: The statement regarding modifications made to the data, which is irrelevant to the task, can be omitted.
4. Breaking up the prompt: The prompt can be broken down into a series of tasks rather than presenting it as a single complex task.
5. Clarification of Comparisons: Clear instructions regarding numerical comparisons should be given i.e., specifying that '5 years old' implies 'more than 5 years old'. 

Improved Prompt:
Review the data provided and pay close attention to each detail. Determine the exact count of animals that are older than 5 years from the tables. Sketch out your method of arriving at the answer and justify it. Once you've analyzed it, select the correct response from the provided options. Denote the chosen answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. After this, ensure your final response matches the choice selected. Review all other possible answers carefully before settling on the final one.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are a total of 7 animals that are more than 5 years old. These include Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 7</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9
Model's Prediction: (C) 7
Correct Answer: (A) 5

Step-by-step review:
1. The question provides two tables; one consists of 4 penguins and another provides details for 4 giraffes. This totals 8 animals.
2. Out of these 8 animals, only 5 are more than 5 years old (Louis, Bernard, Gwen, Gladys, and Donna).
3. However, the model’s prediction is incorrect because it assumed all 8 animals to be more than 5 years old. 

Reason for Error:
1. This error can be attributed to the verbose and complex instruction set in the prompt. It is possible that the model was overloaded with information and did not fully grasp the request. 
2. The statement, "Your analysis ought to be based on the altered state of data after applying all modifications," in the instructions could likely have confused the model as there were no modifications directed to be made in the data. 

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Simplification of instructions: The language in the current prompt could be more straightforward and easy for the model to comprehend. The instructions should be disambiguated.
2. Specific Directions: We can be explicit about what exactly needs to be identified from the table (in this case, animals over 5 years old).
3. Removal of irrelevant information: The statement regarding modifications made to the data, which is irrelevant to the task, can be omitted.
4. Breaking up the prompt: The prompt can be broken down into a series of tasks rather than presenting it as a single complex task.
5. Clarification of Comparisons: Clear instructions regarding numerical comparisons should be given i.e., specifying that '5 years old' implies 'more than 5 years old'. 

Improved Prompt:
Review the data provided and pay close attention to each detail. Determine the exact count of animals that are older than 5 years from the tables. Sketch out your method of arriving at the answer and justify it. Once you've analyzed it, select the correct response from the provided options. Denote the chosen answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. After this, ensure your final response matches the choice selected.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

For this wrong example, there are potential reasons contributing to the model providing a wrong answer.

1. Misinterpretation of the term "last": The model might have misinterpreted "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" as referring to the last (final) giraffe in alphabetical order, rather than the maximum in alphabetical order (i.e., the name appearing last when arranged from A-Z). The prompt failed to clarify what "last" means in this context.

2. The prompt's emphasis on numerical comparisons: The model may have been primed to focus more on numerical comparisons due to prompt's emphasis on such type of comparisons, missing out the fact that the comparison needed in this example is based on alphabetic order.

3. Misleading sentence: The line "Ensure that the final label calculated by you corresponds with the analysis and enclosed chosen answer in your discourse" can be misinterpreted by a language model to mean that its generated prediction needs to correspond with the narrative earlier in the response, which may not necessarily be correct.

Improvement for the Prompt:

1. Clarifying Instructions: When creating the prompt, clearly define what is meant by terms like "last" to avoid misinterpretations.

2. Emphasize all possible comparisons: The prompt should emphasize on all potential comparisons (numerical as well as non-numerical like alphabetical order) so that the model is prepared for all sorts of data interpretation.

3. Training on a diverse set of tests: Ensure that the language model is trained on a more diverse set of tests, including tests where alphabetical order matters.

4. Clear Communication: Ensure that the prompt communicates that the calculated final label or answer must correspond with the actual correct answer, rather than an incorrect analysis the model might have made earlier.

5. Definitive Conclusion: The prompt should clarify that the definitive conclusion has to be consistent with the correct answer, even if the supporting analysis is flawed. 

By attending to these potential areas of improvement, we can enhance the accuracy of the language model.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In this example, the language model was given a table penguin data and asked to identify the penguin that is 70cm tall from the options. The model correctly identified 'Gwen' corresponding to option (D) but incorrectly predicted the answer as option (E).

Reasons:
1. It seems the model understands the table data but may have difficulty correlating answer choices with the given information due to the lettering used to denote the options. It may fail to understand (D) refers to the answer 'Gwen' and not (E) which is another option.
2. The prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to link the answer string given within <answer> tags to its corresponding option letter. The model may simply provide the answer but fail to correlate this to the lettered options.

Wrong Example 2:
In this instance, the model was asked to count the number of giraffes in the tables provided. The model correctly counted four giraffes but failed in providing the answer in the required format i.e., <answer>(D)</answer> instead of <answer>4</answer>.

Reasons:
1. From the output, it seems the model did not understand the requirement properly to put option labels inside <answer> brackets. It placed the calculated number inside the brackets rather than the appropriate option letter.
2. Again, as in the first case, the task instructions in the prompt are not explicit enough, causing this confusion.

To improve the prompt, specific aspects must be addressed:
1. The instruction should clearly require the model to select the letter of the correct option and not just the answer or value itself.
2. Specify clearly in the instructions that the model is required to place these option letters (not the answer or calculated value) within the <answer> tag.
3. In correlating the solution to the right option, the prompt could make it explicit that the model should present the answer as a letter designation that corresponds to the right choice.

gradient:
<1> 
Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
The model's wrong answer: <answer>(C) 3</answer>
Reason: The model's incorrect response indicates either a misunderstanding of the data or a computational error. The giraffes older than 5 years old are Gladys and Donna - two in total. This indicates that the language model didn't accurately parse the information in the table or that the comparison operation was performed incorrectly.
Suggestion: Stress the need for accurate data examination and comprehension in the prompt.

<2> 
Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
The model's wrong answer: <answer>(B) 2</answer>
Reason: The model didn't properly consider the deletion operation specified in the prompt. Bernard was removed from the list, leaving only one penguin, Louis, who is less than 8 years old. This error points to a problem with the task execution, especially the operation cues.
Suggestion: Reinforce the need to accurately execute all actions (additions, removals, comparisons, etc.) mentioned in the prompt within the new prompt.

<3> 
Question: How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
The model's wrong answer: <answer>(B) 2</answer>
Reason: The model seems to have missed the fact that "more than 8 years old" doesn't include 8 year old penguins, and made a mistake when interpreting the conditions.
Suggestion: Emphasize in the prompt the necessity to strictly observe the criteria given in the question.

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:
1. Emphasize careful and accurate examination and understanding of the data.
2. Strengthen the requirement for correct execution of all actions specified in the prompt.
3. Specify that attention needs to be paid to the details in the questions' conditions.
4. The prompt could specify that the language model should double-check its answers prior to finalizing them.

<1> 
Examining the first question, the model made a mistake by including Bernard, the penguin that was deleted from the table, in its count. Despite the prompt asking the model to "execute necessary operations", it didn't fully take the deletion operation into account when answering the question. 

The prompt might be misguiding the model as it is not explicit enough about considering all changes to the table before answering the question. It only vaguely mentions "execute necessary operations such as sorting or comparing values". However, the deletion operation was not explicitly listed, which may have contributed to the oversight.

<2> 
The mistake in the second example happened for a similar reason. The prompt did not lead the model to consider the updated table after the deletion of Bernard. Therefore, even though Gwen is 8 years old, she was counted as "more than 8 years old".

The misinterpretation of the term "more than" could be due to a lack of clear instructions in the prompt about interpreting phrases about comparison such as "more than" or "less than". The model might not differentiate between "more than 8 years old" versus "8 years old and older".

Improvements for the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make the prompt more explicit about considering all changes to the table when answering the question (e.g., addition or deletion of rows).
2. Clearly instruct the model on interpreting phrases of comparison, for example, explain "more than 8 years old" should exclude those who are exactly 8 years old.
3. Encourage the model to pay closer attention to specific details in the question, such as the names of the penguins or the numbers specified.
4. Underline the importance of carefully reviewing the updated data before making any conclusions or computations.
5. Enhance the prompt instructions to emphasize the importance of considering all operations, not just sorting and comparing but deletion and addition too.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

1. Misinterpretation of Terms: For the example given above, the model seems to have misinterpreted the term 'more than.' The question asks for a count of giraffes that are 'more than 5 years old.' This would mean counting the number of giraffes aged 6 or over. However, the model appears to have included giraffes that are 5 years old as well, leading to the wrong count of giraffes.

2. Contextual Understanding: Although it's not explicitly stated in the example whether or not to include the exact age when more than is mentioned, models need some level of contextual understanding to accurately interpret language as it is used in the real world. In this case, the lack of explicit instructions may have led to the model including the giraffe with the exact age of 5.

Aspects for Prompt Improvement:

1. Clarify 'more than' or 'less than' Phrases: The prompt should be revised to ensure that there is a clear understanding of clauses involving 'more than' or 'less than.' These types of statements should be explicitly defined as 'greater but not equal to' or 'less but not equal to' in the task instructions.

2. Contextual Interpretation: The prompt should emphasize the importance of interpreting the context of the question correctly. This would help the model to discriminate between similar yet distinct cases in questions.

3. Promote Detailed Examination: The prompt should encourage the model to scrutinize the data thoroughly, so it doesn't misinterpret or overlook any information.

Revised Prompt: 

Carefully analyze the data in the table provided. Note any adjustments including data additions or deletions, sorting elements, and comparisons of values. Ensure you correctly interpret comparative phrases such as 'more than' (which excludes the exact amount) or 'less than' (excluding the exact amount). Answer the following questions based on your analysis, ensuring your computations and conclusions are always based on the updated information. Your answer should be formatted according to instructions, placing your chosen answer option between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first wrong example, the model correctly identified the penguins who are more than 5 years old. However, it incorrectly processed Bernard, who is exactly 5 years old, as being "more than" 5 years. This suggests confusion in interpreting the comparative phrase 'more than'. The number of penguins that are older than 5 are actually three (Louis, Vincent, Gwen), not four. 

<2> 
In the second wrong example, the model incorrectly counted Bernard the Penguin, who is exactly 5 years old, and Jody the Giraffe, who is also exactly 5 years old, as being more than 5 years old. This signifies the same confusion with the interpretation of ‘more than’ as described in the first example. Furthermore, it seems to count Gwen twice, suggesting another error. The actual number of animals more than 5 years old is 5 (Louis, Vincent, Gwen, Gladys, Donna).

For both of these examples, the issue lies in the model's understanding of the phrase 'more than,' which indicates an age strictly greater than the referenced number, not equal to or greater than. 

Improvements:
1. Strengthening the Phrase Interpretation: The prompt could provide more explicit instructions to differentiate between 'more than', 'less than' and 'equal to' for an unambiguous interpretation by the model.
2. Clarification of Age Criterion: The phrase 'more than 5 years old' can be explicitly defined in the prompt as 'Strictly greater than 5 years, excluding 5.'
3. Cross-Verification: In the case of multiple groups of data (such as penguins and giraffes), the model should be instructed to cross-verify its calculations to avoid duplication or missing out on certain data points.
4. Clear Instructions about Options: The prompt should clarify that the answer should be selected from the provided options and should correspond with the updated information of the table. 
5. Exception Handling: The prompt can include instructions on handling edge cases, like animals having the exact age stated in the question, in order not to misinclude them.
6. Double-checking: The prompt can encourage the language model to double-check its selections before finalizing an answer. This is particularly useful when dealing with comparative phrases and numerical data.
7. Individual Examination: Instruct the model to analyze each data point individually, regardless of groupings/categories, which can help avoid miscalculations or overlooks in data.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins in total. Out of these, Louis, Bernard, Vincent, and Gwen are more than 5 years old. Therefore, there are 4 penguins who are more than 5 years old.
Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) 4</answer>.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are a total of 8 animals that are more than 5 years old. These include Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, Donna, and Gwen. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) 8</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the first wrong example, the model correctly identified the penguins who are more than 5 years old. However, it incorrectly processed Bernard, who is exactly 5 years old, as being "more than" 5 years. This suggests confusion in interpreting the comparative phrase 'more than'. The number of penguins that are older than 5 are actually three (Louis, Vincent, Gwen), not four. 

<2> 
In the second wrong example, the model incorrectly counted Bernard the Penguin, who is exactly 5 years old, and Jody the Giraffe, who is also exactly 5 years old, as being more than 5 years old. This signifies the same confusion with the interpretation of ‘more than’ as described in the first example. Furthermore, it seems to count Gwen twice, suggesting another error. The actual number of animals more than 5 years old is 5 (Louis, Vincent, Gwen, Gladys, Donna).

For both of these examples, the issue lies in the model's understanding of the phrase 'more than,' which indicates an age strictly greater than the referenced number, not equal to or greater than. 

Improvements:
1. Strengthening the Phrase Interpretation: The prompt could provide more explicit instructions to differentiate between 'more than', 'less than' and 'equal to' for an unambiguous interpretation by the model.
2. Clarification of Age Criterion: The phrase 'more than 5 years old' can be explicitly defined in the prompt as 'Strictly greater than 5 years, excluding 5.'
3. Cross-Verification: In the case of multiple groups of data (such as penguins and giraffes), the model should be instructed to cross-verify its calculations to avoid duplication or missing out on certain data points.
4. Clear Instructions about Options: The prompt should clarify that the answer should be selected from the provided options and should correspond with the updated information of the table. 
5. Exception Handling: The prompt can include instructions on handling edge cases, like animals having the exact age stated in the question, in order not to misinclude them.
6. Double-checking: The prompt can encourage the language model to double-check its selections before finalizing an answer. This is particularly useful when dealing with comparative phrases and numerical data.
7. Individual Examination: Instruct the model to analyze each data point individually, regardless of groupings/categories, which can help avoid miscalculations or overlooks in data.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Step-by-step analysis:

1. The model input prompt asks the model to analyze data from two different tables.
2. The model seemed to process the data well and correctly identified the animals that are older than 5 years old.
3. However, the model made a mistake in tallying the total count of animals and included "Gwen" twice.
4. Therefore, the model wrongly output the choice of answer (D) as 8 instead of the correct answer (A) which is 5.

Reasons for the model's wrong answer might include:

- Misinterpretation of the data: The model incorrectly counted "Gwen" twice leading to an overestimated total.
- Processing error in tallying the count: The model seems to have processed the data correctly but failed to tally the correct total.

Areas for prompt improvement:

- The prompt should also instruct the model to check for the consistency and accuracy of the data, including avoiding duplication of the same entity.
- The prompt should stress the importance of accurate counting when tallying figures from the data.
- The prompt could ask the model to cross-verify the obtained information.

Based on the above reasons, to improve the prompt, the following points should be considered:

1. Add an instruction to check for potential duplication: "While analyzing the data, check for and prevent potential duplications of the same entity to ensure accurate computations and conclusions."
2. Emphasize the need for accurate computation: "When tallying numbers or counting entities, ensure accurate computations to reflect the correct total count."
3. Suggest cross-verification: "After forming conclusions based on the data interpretation, cross-verify the obtained information to ensure its accuracy. If any inconsistencies are found, revisit and re-analyze the table data."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In the first example, the model failed to format the answer correctly. While the content of the answer is correct, the model includes extraneous information in the bracketed answer space when it states, "<answer>(1) 1</answer>." The model should only include the answer choice in the bracketed space, like so: <answer>A</answer>. It is possible that the presence of the parentheses and the number 1 inside the brackets confused the model.

Reasons for the error in the first example:
- Multilayered instruction: The prompt has multilayered instructions that instruct the model not only to interpret the data in a table format but also to perform tasks like deletion and filtering. The model may not understand the complex nature of these instructions.
- Lack of clarity on the answer format: The prompt asks for the answer to be enclosed in brackets but does not clearly specify that only the option letter should be included.

<2>
In the second example, the model gives the wrong answer completely. The correct answer should be (B) 2, but the model answered as (C) 3, counting Jody who is 5 years old as "more than 5 years old."

Reasons for the error in the second example:
- Incorrect interpretation of 'more than': The model has incorrectly included a giraffe aged exactly 5 years old as part of the ones that are 'more than' 5 years old, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the phrase 'more than.'

Based on these reasons, the prompt can be improved in the following ways:
1. More explicit instruction on the answer format: The prompt should clearly specify that only the option letter should be included within the brackets. Example: "Enclose your chosen answer option within <answer> and </answer>, e.g., if the correct option is A, write <answer>A</answer>."
2. Provide a simple example: The prompt could include a simple example to illustrate the interpretation and processing of table data and deletion of entities. 
3. Better specify task nuances: Specify that 'more than' does not include the exact number. For instance, 'more than 5' does not include 5.
4. Break down complex actions: The prompt could provide better guidance on managing complex actions, such as the deletion of entities and identifying duplicates. It should be clarified these are separate actions from the interpretation and analysis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Thoroughly interpret the data in the provided table, also ensuring checks for accuracy and consistency, including potential duplications of the same entity. Watch out for changes such as additions or deletions of data, sorting, and comparisons of values, and ensure correct interpretation of phrases of comparison like 'more than' or 'less than.' After careful analysis, provide concise answers for the questions that follow, remembering to carry out accurate computations. Verify your obtained information for consistency. Always use the updated data while arriving at your conclusions. Finally, present your answer in the specified format by enclosing your choice of answer within <answer> and </answer>. Rigorous attention to detail and accurate interpretation of data will lead to precise answers.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Thoroughly interpret the data in the provided table, also ensuring checks for accuracy and consistency, including potential duplications of the same entity. Watch out for changes such as additions or deletions of data, sorting, and comparisons of values, and ensure correct interpretation of phrases of comparison like 'more than' or 'less than.'

Rigorous attention to detail and accurate interpretation of data will lead to precise answers.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
After deleting Bernard from the table, we are left with three penguins:
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

Among these penguins, only Vincent is more than 8 years old. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(1) 1</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: N/A: Format error.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
In the first example, the model failed to format the answer correctly. While the content of the answer is correct, the model includes extraneous information in the bracketed answer space when it states, "<answer>(1) 1</answer>." The model should only include the answer choice in the bracketed space, like so: <answer>A</answer>. It is possible that the presence of the parentheses and the number 1 inside the brackets confused the model.

Reasons for the error in the first example:
- Multilayered instruction: The prompt has multilayered instructions that instruct the model not only to interpret the data in a table format but also to perform tasks like deletion and filtering. The model may not understand the complex nature of these instructions.
- Lack of clarity on the answer format: The prompt asks for the answer to be enclosed in brackets but does not clearly specify that only the option letter should be included.

<2>
In the second example, the model gives the wrong answer completely. The correct answer should be (B) 2, but the model answered as (C) 3, counting Jody who is 5 years old as "more than 5 years old."

Reasons for the error in the second example:
- Incorrect interpretation of 'more than': The model has incorrectly included a giraffe aged exactly 5 years old as part of the ones that are 'more than' 5 years old, demonstrating a misunderstanding of the phrase 'more than.'

Based on these reasons, the prompt can be improved in the following ways:
1. More explicit instruction on the answer format: The prompt should clearly specify that only the option letter should be included within the brackets. Example: "Enclose your chosen answer option within <answer> and </answer>, e.g., if the correct option is A, write <answer>A</answer>."
2. Provide a simple example: The prompt could include a simple example to illustrate the interpretation and processing of table data and deletion of entities. 
3. Better specify task nuances: Specify that 'more than' does not include the exact number. For instance, 'more than 5' does not include 5.
4. Break down complex actions: The prompt could provide better guidance on managing complex actions, such as the deletion of entities and identifying duplicates. It should be clarified these are separate actions from the interpretation and analysis.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the example, the task given to the model is to determine the last giraffe sorted in alphabetical order. The model incorrectly selected (D) Donna instead of (C) Marian. This error has occurred because the model has not successfully understood the task to sort alphabetic order correctly or has made some computational errors as it considered "Donna" to be alphabetically later than "Marian", which is wrong. 

Areas of Improvement:

1. Elaborate on the sorting functionality: The prompt could provide a clearer definition on how to sort data, especially for strings such as names in terms of alphabetical order. This can be achieved by emphasizing the concept of sorting names alphabetically and explaining this process as comparable to a dictionary order.

2. Highlight outliers: Ensure that the model is aware of any exceptions or outliers in the dataset. In the provided example, the name "Louise" seems to be an outlier because it does not belong to the giraffe dataset. Therefore, the model must also be taught to remove or rectify these outliers before processing the data.

3. Refine on understanding commands: Improve the model's understanding in dealing with the execution of specific commands, like "sorted by alphabetic order", "more than", "less than". It should be trained to understand complex structures while retaining the simplicity of commands.

4. Emphasize on response formatting: The prompt should stress the importance of conforming to a specific response format. In this case, it is mentioned that the answer should be bracketed between "<answer>" and "</answer>". However, the model failed to include the answer format, providing only the option (D) rather than the requirement which is <answer>(D)</answer>. 

5. Implement steps for data verification: Include a step to summarize or recount the data that has been analyzed in order to validate its accuracy, and emphasize on the crossover verification between tables while comparing data.

Example Error Analysis:

Error 1:
The error hinges on the interpretation of 'more than 5 years old'. The model has misinterpreted this as '5 years old and above', leading to an incorrect count. Gladys (10), Donna (9), and Jody (5) are counted, totally 3. However, 'more than 5 years old' should exclude Jody (5), only counting Gladys (10) and Donna(9), totalling 2. It seems the language model's general interpretation of 'more than' includes the number itself, but in this context, it shouldn’t.

Improvements: 

1. Provide clearer instructions: Include clearer instructions about interpreting comparative terms such as 'more than' or 'less than' emphasizing not to include the number itself in the 'more than' count, and to include the number itself in 'less than' count. 

2. Clarification/examples on 'more than': The instructions could showcase an example of 'more than' and 'less than' to help the model understand the correct interpretation.

3. General Counting Instructions: Add instructions to prompt about verifying outputs based on the context itself. In this case, the number of possible options (A to E) didn't match with the model's count. This indicates that there could be something wrong with the interpretation, so more caution is needed while forming answers.

Updated Prompt:

Interpret the data in the provided table carefully, ensure you confirm the accuracy, and maintain checks for consistency, including any potential duplications of the same entity. While examining for any changes such as additions or deletions of data, sorting, and comparisons of values, make certain to convey the correct interpretation of comparison phrases. For instance, when comparing 'more than x', ensure the count does not include 'x' itself. Conversely, when evaluating 'less than x', include 'x' in your count. Make absolutely sure to check the computations for accuracy and cross-verify your obtained information for consistency. Always use updated data while concluding your analysis. Present your answer in the specified format by enclosing your choice within <answer> and </answer>. Please pay attention to detail and ensure an accurate interpretation of data. Critically cross-verify your answer with the context and provided options in order to arrive at a precise conclusion.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Thoroughly interpret the data in the provided table, also ensuring checks for accuracy and consistency, including potential duplications of the same entity. Watch out for changes such as additions or deletions of data, sorting, and comparisons of values, and ensure correct interpretation of phrases of comparison like 'more than' or 'less than.' After careful analysis, provide concise answers for the questions that follow, remembering to carry out accurate computations. Verify your obtained information for consistency.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 giraffes who are more than 5 years old: Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example Error Analysis:

Error 1:
The error hinges on the interpretation of 'more than 5 years old'. The model has misinterpreted this as '5 years old and above', leading to an incorrect count. Gladys (10), Donna (9), and Jody (5) are counted, totally 3. However, 'more than 5 years old' should exclude Jody (5), only counting Gladys (10) and Donna(9), totalling 2. It seems the language model's general interpretation of 'more than' includes the number itself, but in this context, it shouldn’t.

Improvements: 

1. Provide clearer instructions: Include clearer instructions about interpreting comparative terms such as 'more than' or 'less than' emphasizing not to include the number itself in the 'more than' count, and to include the number itself in 'less than' count. 

2. Clarification/examples on 'more than': The instructions could showcase an example of 'more than' and 'less than' to help the model understand the correct interpretation.

3. General Counting Instructions: Add instructions to prompt about verifying outputs based on the context itself. In this case, the number of possible options (A to E) didn't match with the model's count. This indicates that there could be something wrong with the interpretation, so more caution is needed while forming answers.
