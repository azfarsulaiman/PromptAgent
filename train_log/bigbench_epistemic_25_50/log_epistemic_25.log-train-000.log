For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:
In the first example, the model was asked to identify the relation between a premise and a hypothesis. However, the initial prompt asks to answer questions about causal attribution, which is not directly related to the task of identifying logical entailments. This could confuse the model about what it is actually trying to evaluate. Furthermore, the model might not fully understand the meaning of 'entailment' in this context, leading to the incorrect answer.

Wrong example 2:
Similar to the first example, the model was asked to make an assessment about entailment, but the question was framed in terms of causal attribution. This could have confused the model about the requirement of the task. Moreover, the model might have failed to identify that the detailed explanation of the premise implies the hypothesis, leading it to interpret the relation as 'non-entailment' instead.

Wrong example 3:
The model correctly identified the concept of entailment in this case but wrongly applied it. The model assumed that because Ava believes that Emma suspects about the kids' skit, this automatically entails that Emma indeed suspects that. The prompt's instruction on causal attribution could have confused the model's understanding of the logical relation asked.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Specify the task more precisely: The current prompt mentioned causal attribution but the task is about entailment between a premise and a hypothesis. It should be reworded to something like "Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses".
2. Clearly define the options: Provide clear definitions for 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' and examples prior to giving the task to help the model understand them better.
3. Eliminate unnecessary information: The instruction to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer> could be removed from the question section and handled separately as a formatting instruction.
4. Provide more context: When the task changes to an unrelated topic, more context about the task should be provided.
5. Train the model on related tasks: Before asking the model to work on the logical entailment task, it would be helpful if the model was trained on related tasks. This could help the model learn the core concept of entailment and be able to apply it correctly.

For the given example, the reasons as to why the prompt could be leading to the wrong answer are:

1. The prompt could be confusing to the model because it asks to "Answer questions about causal attribution". This question directly relates to cause-and-effect,  reasoning for which action caused which event and to what degree. But, the example given is more about detecting entailment in sentences. The approach and logic involved in causal attribution and entailment detection are distinct, which could be leading to the confusion.

2. The description of the task within the model input is complex and multi-layered. It requires the model to determine the relationship between two sentences and then to format that decision in a particular way. The conflicting instructions might be distracting the language model.

3. The model might not fully understand the exact relation between Robert, Richard, and the man examining his facial hair. There may be some confusion due to the multiple levels of assumptions/remembering present within the premise.

Improvements to the prompt can include:

1. Change the initial prompt from "Answer questions about causal attribution" to "Determine the level of entailment between premises and hypotheses" to better align with the task being asked.

2. Split up the task into discrete parts in order for the model to more easily understand each component of the overall task. 

3. Give clearer examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to set clear benchmarks for the model.

4. Simplify the sentences used in the examples. Remove potentially confusing elements such as multiple layers of assumptions/remembering.

5. Add more direct instructions in the prompt about what 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' mean, to make it easy for the model to understand the concept.

Wrong Example Analysis:

Examining the question in Example 1, it is observed that the language model faces difficulty in making correct causal attribution in this scenario. The question seems to be a language entailment problem which can be difficult to correctly answer without any causal link between the premise and the hypothesis. 

The model’s response shows that it incorrectly assumed causal attribution, leading to the inference that 'Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium’ necessarily entails 'Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.' 

The reason for this error might be various factors associated with the complexity of the task, one of them being the subtle difference between language entailment and cause-effect relationships. 

Essentially, the model might have been confused due to the form of the question, which required the identification of an entailment relationship and not a causal attribution. Another factor that may have contributed to the wrong output might be the double layer of report ('Joseph suspects' that 'Isabella learns') in the premise, creating an indirect knowledge scenario that might have not been correctly processed by the model.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Make sure the prompt accurately describes the task at hand. For entailment problems, it might be more accurate to use a prompts such as 'Answer questions about logical entailment' or 'Identify the logical relation between premises and hypotheses.' 

2. Emphasize the distinction between entailment and causation. The model needs to understand that they are not the same thing. 

3. Include better guidance for the model about complex language scenarios, such as double layer of report, where it might be difficult without a deep semantic understanding. 

4. Ensure that the prompt makes it clear that the model should highlight the answer within the <answer> and </answer> brackets.

5. Try to provide a clear description of what entailment and non-entailment mean to give the model a sound basis for making its choices. 

6. Make the instructions more specific to entailment task rather than causal attribution, as this might avoid confusion for the model.

gradient:
It appears that the language model is inferring a direct relationship between James' thinking and what Richard understands. This inference is a source of error. The language model is not correctly grasping the nuanced distinction between someone's perception of another's understanding and the actual understanding of the latter. Thus, the specific instruction to the model may be ambiguous or not detailed enough to accurately handle such nuanced scenarios.

Reasons for incorrect inference:

1. Lack of explicit instructions: The prompt doesn't explicitly direct the model to consider the difference between perceptions of knowledge and actual knowledge.

2. Over-simplification: The model seems to simplify the situation and does not recognize the nuanced distinction inferring direct knowledge where it should infer perceived knowledge.

3. Assumption of transitivity: The model might incorrectly assume that if James thinks that Richard understands a situation, it necessarily means that Richard does understand that situation. This assumption is a logical fallacy that could be leading to incorrect inference deriving from the provided example.

Improvements:

1. Clarity: The prompt could be made clearer by adding more detailed instructions, perhaps instructing to separately assess the perceptions and actual knowledge of the involved individuals.

2. Training: More training examples involving complex and nuanced logical entailments, including scenarios distinguishing between someone's perception and actual situations, could improve the model's ability to correctly identify entailment or non-entailment.

3. Broader classifications: The model currently operates under binary classifications ('entailment' or 'non-entailment'). Inclusion of options that allow for more nuance or uncertainty may improve accuracy in such scenarios.

Thus, the specific instruction to the model may be ambiguous or not detailed enough to accurately handle such nuanced scenarios.

Reasons for incorrect inference:

1. Lack of explicit instructions: The prompt doesn't explicitly direct the model to consider the difference between perceptions of knowledge and actual knowledge.

2. Over-simplification: The model seems to simplify the situation and does not recognize the nuanced distinction inferring direct knowledge where it should infer perceived knowledge.

3. Assumption of transitivity: The model might incorrectly assume that if James thinks that Richard understands a situation, it necessarily means that Richard does understand that situation. This assumption is a logical fallacy that could be leading to incorrect inference deriving from the provided example.

Improvements:

1. Clarity: The prompt could be made clearer by adding more detailed instructions, perhaps instructing to separately assess the perceptions and actual knowledge of the involved individuals.

2. Training: More training examples involving complex and nuanced logical entailments, including scenarios distinguishing between someone's perception and actual situations, could improve the model's ability to correctly identify entailment or non-entailment.

3. Broader classifications: The model currently operates under binary classifications ('entailment' or 'non-entailment'). Inclusion of options that allow for more nuance or uncertainty may improve accuracy in such scenarios.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph suspects that Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium. Hypothesis: Isabella learns that a woman is standing at a podium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
(entailment) <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard sees that Charles assumes that a small child with a backpack walks down a narrow road next to a painted wall. Hypothesis: Charles assumes that a small child with a backpack walks down a narrow road next to a painted wall.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
(B) non-entailment
<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

In this example, the issue with the prompt is in the complexity of understanding the stated information. The model seems to misinterpret the premise and the hypothesis. The premise only talks about Joseph's suspicion about Isabella's knowledge, not the reality of Isabella's knowledge. The model's response, therefore, should have been (B) non-entailment, as the premise doesn't guarantee the hypothesis. 

<2>

In the second example, the issue is similar to the first one. The model again fails to understand the deep logical relation between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise is about Richard's observation of Charles's assumption, and the hypothesis is about Charles's assumption. Here the model chose option (B) as the response, misunderstanding the entailment in the provided statement. In fact, given Richard sees Charles's assumption, it means the assumption itself exists, thus it should be (A) entailment.

In summary, the mistakes seem to arise from both a lack of clear understanding of complex relations in the input and difficulty in correlating the hypothesis with the premise.

Based on these observations, the following aspects could improve the prompt:

1. The question needs to be rephrased more clearly to focus on whether the premise 'proves' the hypothesis or not.
2. The prompt could provide a few simpler examples to guide the model in understanding the complexity of human behavior-related scenarios. 
3. Prompt should emphasize the difference between someone's perception (or belief, observation, assumption) and the objective truth.
4. The prompt could also specify that entailment means the hypothesis can be fully derived from the premise, not just that there seems to be a connection between them.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
For the first example, the language model incorrectly responded with 'non-entailment'. Even if the bike is airborne, the premise of the situation can logically entail that a rider is riding the motocross bike, because there's no alternative mentioned about the bike being controlled remotely, for example. One reason for this confusion could be that the heuristic might've made it believe that airborne bikes do not involve direct riding. This indicates that the prompt could use more clarity in emphasizing that 'entailment' applies when there's any potential scenario that the hypothesis could be true given the premise.

<2>
The second example is incorrect because the model responds with 'entailment', implying that if one person believes people are on a sidewalk, another person necessarily also believes that. This isn't necessarily correct because beliefs aren't automatically transmitted between people. This error could originate from the language model misunderstanding the relationship between beliefs of different individuals. Hence, the prompt should clarify the discretization of perspectives in the task.

<3>
In the third example, the model again incorrectly chose 'non-entailment'. Given the premise states that two women are tending to their herd of animals, it does imply that they are taking care of a herd of animals. The misjudgment may be due to the model making unnecessary inferences based on additional information in the premise (e.g. the type of animals or the surrounding environment). This signals that the prompt needs to place greater emphasis on ignoring additional details in the premise which do not directly impact the veracity of the hypothesis.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize that 'entailment' applies as long as there's any potential scenario that could make the hypothesis true, without pondering over implicit, unmentioned alternatives.
2. Clarify that beliefs, assumptions, and perspectives should be treated as independent among different individuals.
3. Highlight that unnecessary additional details in the premise, which do not impact the veracity of the hypothesis, should be ignored.
4. Ensure the AI model understands to focus on the overall inference rather than over-complicating the premises.

gradient:
<1>
In the first example, the model's incorrect response likely stems from an inadequate understanding of the distinction between someone's perception or belief and objective truth, which is emphasized in the prompt.

Steps:
1. The prompt details that a person's perception or belief is not considered proof of the objective truth.
2. The premise 'James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.' is based on James' belief or perception.
3. The hypothesis 'Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.' is indirectly being referred to as a belief of James.

In this situation, the model should've selected 'non-entailment', since the premise doesn't definitively prove the hypothesis. Instead, the model chose 'entailment' indicating a comprehension skew in recognizing the nuanced relationship between someone's belief and objective truth.

<2>
In the second example, the model makes a similar mistake, suggesting a persistent confusion in discerning the difference between beliefs or perceptions and objective truths.

Steps:
1. The prompt outlines that someone's belief or perception isn't considered proof of the objective truth.
2. The premise 'Abigail believes that Emma knows that navy men stand along a red carpet and salute as their superior walks by.' is rooted in Abigail's belief.
3. The hypothesis 'Emma knows that navy men stand along a red carpet and salute as their superior walks by.' is indirectly cited as Abigail's belief.

Again, the model chose 'entailment' when 'non-entailment' was the correct answer. This indicates that the model isn't effectively understanding the prompt's instruction about the importance of objective truth being provable, as opposed to being contingent on one individual's belief or perception.

Improvements:
1. Clarify the distinction between perceptions/beliefs and provable truths: The prompt should further emphasize the distinction between a person's belief or perception and an objective, provable truth. Essentially, the validation of a hypothesis must depend on concrete, observable and objective premise and not on someone's perception or belief.
2. Add more examples: Including more examples - especially those that illustrate the difference between a belief-based premise and a fact-based premise - may teach the model to better distinguish between entailment and non-entailment in future tasks.
3. Simplify language: Simplifying the language of the prompt might help the model to understand the task requirement clearly.
4. Spell the distinction in each case: In each input, specify that "if the premise is based on someone's belief or perception, select 'non-entailment' and if the premise provides direct observable evidence of the hypothesis, select 'entailment'". This way model gets reminded of the important distinction before making a choice.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
(2) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis can be fully proved strictly based on the information in the premise, select 'entailment'.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Assess the logical relationship between the statement (premise) and the conclusion (hypothesis). If the hypothesis is unquestionably true given the information from the premise alone, then choose 'entailment'. If the hypothesis is not inevitably true strictly using the premise, opt for 'non-entailment'. Crucially, a person's belief, perception, or assumption is NOT an evidence of the objective fact. Your answer must come in the format <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples for clarity:

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book' and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', select 'non-entailment'. This illustrates the point that the assumption of an individual (John, in this case) doesn't guarantee Sara's possession of the book.

Example 2: If the premise states 'David sees that Peter gives a speech on stage' and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', select 'entailment'. This is because David's observation is a direct evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Please remember: if the premise is based solely on someone's perception, belief, or assumption, always select 'non-entailment'. If the premise gives directly observable and unquestionable evidence of the hypothesis, select 'entailment'.

Task: Analyze the logical relationship between each premise and hypothesis below, and select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as the case maybe. Write your answer, choosing from the options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Wrong Example 1:

Question: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.

Model's Answer: <entailment></entailment>

Correct Answer: B (non-entailment)

Analysis: 

The correct answer follows from the instructions of the prompt because James's thought doesn't provide factual evidence that Richard understands the situation. It’s based on James’s perception, not an independent source of truth. However, the model seems to interpret that the details of the premise and the hypothesis match syntactically and semantically, leading to the wrong answer. 

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors. Hypothesis: Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors.

Model's Answer: <entailment></entailment>

Correct Answer: B (non-entailment)

Analysis: 

Just like the first example, the model makes a mistake in its interpretation. Richard's belief does not count as a concrete piece of evidence that supports the hypothesis. The model's misunderstanding may come from the identical details in the premise and the hypothesis. 

Summary of Problems in the Prompt and Potential Ways to Improve:

1. Interpretation of Perception-Based Statements: The language model doesn't seem to differentiate between 'belief' or 'assumption' and 'objective evidence'. Despite the instructions, these subtleties escape the model, leading to a discrepancy in understanding. This issue could be rectified by emphasizing in the prompt that beliefs, assumptions, perceptions, thoughts, and similar phenomena, are not strong evidence for entailment.

2. Syntactic and Semantic Matching: The language model may focus more on the syntactic and semantic congruence of the premise and hypothesis, rather than understanding the concept of 'proof' and 'evidence'. The prompt should stress that semantic and syntactic similarity does not equate to entailment, unless rooted in verifiable evidence.

3. More Examples: The model might benefit from a larger number of examples in the prompt that help highlight the difference between entailment and non-entailment based on objective evidence versus perception.
   
4. Clear Definition: Providing a clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could guide the model more effectively in its responses. The definition should explicitly state that 'entailment' requires solid, undeniable evidence, while 'non-entailment' occurs when the evidence is insufficient or based on subjective elements like beliefs or assumptions. 

By making these changes, the language model may respond more accurately to future similar prompts.

Example 2: If the premise is 'David witnesses that Peter gives a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', since David's witnessing provides direct evidence of Peter giving a speech on stage.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors. Hypothesis: Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<entailment></entailment>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.

Model's Answer: <entailment></entailment>

Correct Answer: B (non-entailment)

Analysis: 

The correct answer follows from the instructions of the prompt because James's thought doesn't provide factual evidence that Richard understands the situation. It’s based on James’s perception, not an independent source of truth. However, the model seems to interpret that the details of the premise and the hypothesis match syntactically and semantically, leading to the wrong answer. 

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors. Hypothesis: Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors.

Model's Answer: <entailment></entailment>

Correct Answer: B (non-entailment)

Analysis: 

Just like the first example, the model makes a mistake in its interpretation. Richard's belief does not count as a concrete piece of evidence that supports the hypothesis. The model's misunderstanding may come from the identical details in the premise and the hypothesis. 

Summary of Problems in the Prompt and Potential Ways to Improve:

1. Interpretation of Perception-Based Statements: The language model doesn't seem to differentiate between 'belief' or 'assumption' and 'objective evidence'. Despite the instructions, these subtleties escape the model, leading to a discrepancy in understanding. This issue could be rectified by emphasizing in the prompt that beliefs, assumptions, perceptions, thoughts, and similar phenomena, are not strong evidence for entailment.

2. Syntactic and Semantic Matching: The language model may focus more on the syntactic and semantic congruence of the premise and hypothesis, rather than understanding the concept of 'proof' and 'evidence'. The prompt should stress that semantic and syntactic similarity does not equate to entailment, unless rooted in verifiable evidence.

3. More Examples: The model might benefit from a larger number of examples in the prompt that help highlight the difference between entailment and non-entailment based on objective evidence versus perception.
   
4. Clear Definition: Providing a clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could guide the model more effectively in its responses. The definition should explicitly state that 'entailment' requires solid, undeniable evidence, while 'non-entailment' occurs when the evidence is insufficient or based on subjective elements like beliefs or assumptions. 

By making these changes, the language model may respond more accurately to future similar prompts.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
(2) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis can be fully proved strictly based on the information in the premise, select 'entailment'. If the hypothesis cannot be definitively proved using only the premise, select 'non-entailment'. Remember, someone's perception or belief is not a proof of the objective truth. Provide your answer between the options provided, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples: 

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since John's assumption does not prove definite ownership of the book by Sara. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'David witnesses that Peter gives a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', since David's witnessing provides direct evidence of Peter giving a speech on stage.

Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Provide an answer indicating whether the hypothesis is completely proved by the premise. If it can be fully proved strictly based on the premise, choose 'entailment'. If the hypothesis cannot be definitively proved using only the premise, choose 'non-entailment'. Highlight the crucial difference: beliefs, assumptions, perceptions, and thoughts are not definitive proofs of reality and so do not provide objective evidence. Base your answer on undeniable, concrete evidence rather than personal beliefs or assumptions. Ensure your answer is enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. Observe these examples:

Example 1: For the premise 'John believes that Jessica has a cat', and the hypothesis is 'Jessica has a cat', the correct answer is 'non-entailment', since John's belief doesn't provide undeniable proof that Jessica owns a cat.

Example 2: For the premise 'The Metro news reported that a meteorite fell in the city center', and the hypothesis is 'A meteorite fell in the city center', the correct answer is 'entailment', given the fact that the Metro news report provides a form of objective evidence.

Even if a premise and a hypothesis match semantically or syntactically, it doesn't imply entailment unless it's based on undeniable evidence. Evaluate the premise along these lines and respond accordingly.
Identify the relation between the presented premise and hypotheses, and select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as your answer.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Explanation for Wrong Example:

The model incorrectly interprets Richard's assumption about Abigail's thoughts as enough evidence to confirm the hypothesis. The model seems to consider the assumption as a form of direct evidence similar to the 'witnessing' in the second example of the prompt. However, the prompt clearly specifies that 'someone's perception or belief is not a proof of the objective truth.' There seems to be some confusion for the model between the concepts of 'perception or belief' and 'assumption'. If 'assumption' were explicitly included as a concept that is not definitive proof, this confusion might be reduced.

Here are several reasons why the prompt may have led to the wrong answer:

1. Lack of Clarity in Instructions: The prompt instructs to select 'entailment' if the hypothesis can be fully proved based on the premise and to choose 'non-entailment' if it cannot be definitively proved using the premise. However, the concept of 'proof' in this context appears to be somewhat ambiguous, leading the model to interpret assumptions as definitive proof.

2. Unclear Examples: The examples given only include an instance of an assumption not being a proof and an eye-witness account being sufficient proof. Examples covering a wider range of scenarios might help enhance understanding.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Enhance Definitions: Particularly define the concept of 'proof' more explicitly and emphasize the difference between perceptions, beliefs, assumptions, and what constitutes definitive proof.

2. Broaden Range of Examples: Include examples with different types of premises to expose the model to various scenarios. This might include premises based on hearsay, hypothesis, speculation, etc., and their relation to the hypothesis.

3. Add Negative Examples: Include examples that illustrate what does not constitute an 'entailment' or sufficient proof.

4. Specify Explicitly that Assumptions Do Not Constitute Proof: The prompt should clarify that assumptions do not provide definitive proof for the hypothesis. This could help the model distinguish between various types of evidence. 

5. Ask for Justification: Require the model to justify its choice could also help it think more deeply about the connection between the premise and the hypothesis.

Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'. It's crucial to remember that the perspective of an individual, including their perceived assumptions or beliefs, cannot constitute concrete evidence of objective reality. 

Provide your answer by choosing from the available options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Let's examine these examples to better understand: 

Example 1: Premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since an assumption does not provide concrete evidence of Sara having a book. 

Example 2: Premise is 'David observes Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', because observation provides direct, concrete evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Example 3: Premise is 'Mandy said that she heard from her friend that John has a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John has a green car', you should select 'non-entailment' since hearsay does not provide solid proof of John's car color.

After identifying the relation between the following premise and hypothesis, choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', remember to provide a succinct justification for your selection. 
Premise: Provide premise here
Hypothesis: Provide hypothesis here

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Justification: The premise directly states that Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. This concrete evidence entails that Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle, as the description matches the scenario provided in the premise.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:

In the provided incorrect example, it seems that the error arises due to confusion around the distinction between the premise and the hypothesis. The model tries to match events or descriptions in the context of the premise and the hypothesis, overlooking the fundamental distinction between the two individuals (Taylor and Richard) mentioned in the statements. The instructions in the prompt lacked clarity in explaining that understandings or perceptions of one individual cannot solidify proof for another individual's understanding in the context of identifying 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.

Reasons:

1. Lack of clarity in defining 'entailment' and 'non-entailment': While the prompt attempts to clarify the concepts of entailment and non-entailment, it doesn't adequately underscore the impact of individual perspectives in these definitions.

2. Ambiguities concerning perceptions and understandings: The prompt does state that an individual's perspective, including their perceived assumptions or beliefs, cannot constitute concrete evidence. However, it doesn't explain that this also applies to someone else's understanding.

3. The options for 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' lack context: The given examples do not consider the impact of perspective shifts from one individual to another, leading to errors when such situations are introduced.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Expand 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' definitions: Elaborate more on the definitions. Explain that the premise proving the hypothesis involves concrete, observable facts applicable universally and not affected by individual experiences or perceptions.

2. Clarify application of perceptions or understandings: Make it clear that an individual's understanding cannot be used as concrete evidence of what another person may understand or perceive.

3. Provide context-oriented examples: While providing clear cut examples for entailment and non-entailment, ensure that these examples also account for situations involving different perspectives or understanding of different individuals.

4. Enhance the instructions: Make it clear to the model that when deciding 'entailment' and 'non-entailment', the choice should not only depend on the content match between the premise and hypothesis but also on the presence of concrete, universally applicable evidence in the premise supporting the hypothesis.

5. Structure the task appropriately: The task should be framed explicitly, and the critical points in the prompt should be emphasized more for better comprehension.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
(2) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis can be fully proved strictly based on the information in the premise, select 'entailment'. If the hypothesis cannot be definitively proved using only the premise, select 'non-entailment'. Remember, someone's perception or belief is not a proof of the objective truth. Provide your answer between the options provided, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples: 

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since John's assumption does not prove definite ownership of the book by Sara. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'David witnesses that Peter gives a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', since David's witnessing provides direct evidence of Peter giving a speech on stage.
(3) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'.

Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in a manner that only relies on concrete, universally applicable evidence - not perceptions, assumptions, or beliefs of an individual or a transfer of understanding from one individual to another. To choose 'entailment', the premise should provide irrefutable proof that directly leads to the hypothesis. If the premise only outlines subjective experiences, assumptions, or beliefs - even when transferred among individuals - or lacks compelling evidence, choose 'non-entailment'. 

Choose an answer from the given options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>, also provide a succinct justification for your selection. Consider these examples for better understanding:

Example 1: Premise is 'John concludes that Helen has a cat', and the hypothesis is 'Helen has a cat'. Despite John's conclusion, you should select 'non-entailment', as John's conclusion doesn't constitute concrete proof of Helen owning a cat.

Example 2: Premise is 'The security camera footage shows a man breaking into a store', and the hypothesis is 'A store was broken into'. You should select 'entailment', because the footage offers concrete evidence of the break-in event.

Example 3: Premise is 'Robert expresses to Sarah that he saw Tom moving into a new house', and the hypothesis is 'Sarah knows that Tom moved into a new house'. Here, you should select 'non-entailment', as Robert's information doesn't necessarily make it a known fact for Sarah.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The problem in this case lies in the interpretation of the example provided in the prompt. The prompt states that assumptions do not provide solid proof, which is true when the hypothesis asks to validate those assumptions. However, in this case, the hypothesis is only about 'Richard's assumption'. Here, it's not important whether Richard's premise is correct or not (i.e., whether a man examines his facial hair). Instead, Robert's memory is providing direct proof that Richard has made an assumption - making it an 'entailment'. This level of nuance might have been overlooked given the examples provided in the prompt, hence leading to a wrong interpretation and answer.

Wrong Example 2:
In this case, a similar misunderstanding seems to have affected the model's response. The focus is not on whether the understanding of the scenario (a man riding a bicycle) is correct, but whether if Taylor’s understanding signifies Richard's understanding. From the premise, we cannot claim that Richard understands the same, as there is no provided evidence related to Richard’s understanding in the premise. This confusion may have resulted from the lack of clarity in the guidelines provided in the prompt, particularly on how to handle cases where the hypothesis refers to a different subject than the one mentioned in the premise.

Improvements:
1. The prompt could be clearer about how to interpret different degrees of evidence (like memory, assumption, hearsay, observation) and their validity for entailment.
2. Some more complex examples could be added to the guidelines, including shifts in subject from premise to hypothesis, addressing nuances such as when the hypothesis concerns someone's understanding or assumption, rather than the reality inferred from such understanding or assumption.
3. It should be more explicit in stating that the evaluation of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' needs to strictly concentrate on the relationship between premise and hypothesis, not the assumed accord of the premise or the hypothesis with objective reality. 
4. The guidelines could instruct the model to pay close attention to the subjects mentioned in the premise and hypothesis. It should only infer entailment when there's unambiguous, direct evidence in the premise that can prove the hypothesis, regardless of the actual scenario described.
5. The prompt should advise the model to carefully consider semantic subtleties, beliefs, perceptions, and how they relate to the interpretation of the premise and the hypothesis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'. It's crucial to remember that the perspective of an individual, including their perceived assumptions or beliefs, cannot constitute concrete evidence of objective reality. 

Provide your answer by choosing from the available options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Let's examine these examples to better understand: 

Example 1: Premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since an assumption does not provide concrete evidence of Sara having a book. 

Example 2: Premise is 'David observes Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', because observation provides direct, concrete evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Example 3: Premise is 'Mandy said that she heard from her friend that John has a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John has a green car', you should select 'non-entailment' since hearsay does not provide solid proof of John's car color.

After identifying the relation between the following premise and hypothesis, choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', remember to provide a succinct justification for your selection. 
Premise: Provide premise here
Hypothesis: Provide hypothesis here

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Justification: Robert's memory of Richard's assumption does not provide concrete evidence that Richard actually assumes that a man examines his facial hair. It is based on Robert's perception and memory, which may not accurately reflect Richard's thoughts or beliefs. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Justification: The premise directly states that Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people, which implies that there is a man riding a bicycle. This concrete evidence supports the hypothesis, leading to entailment.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:

5. The prompt should advise the model to carefully consider semantic subtleties, beliefs, perceptions, and how they relate to the interpretation of the premise and the hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
(2) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis can be fully proved strictly based on the information in the premise, select 'entailment'. If the hypothesis cannot be definitively proved using only the premise, select 'non-entailment'. Remember, someone's perception or belief is not a proof of the objective truth. Provide your answer between the options provided, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples: 

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since John's assumption does not prove definite ownership of the book by Sara. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'David witnesses that Peter gives a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', since David's witnessing provides direct evidence of Peter giving a speech on stage.
(3) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Assess the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis using the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' should be selected if the premise offers indisputable, objective, and concrete evidence that proves the hypothesis in entirety. 'Non-entailment' should be selected when the premise yields incomplete, subjective, or nebulous evidence such as assumptions, beliefs, perceptions, or memories that do not solidly support the hypothesis. Remember, it is not the truthfulness of the premise or hypothesis that matters, but the procedural evidence from premise to hypothesis.

It's important to underline that the model cannot use its own knowledge or assumptions about the world; it can only use the information provided in the premise. Strictly focus on the proof linkage between the premise and hypothesis and pay close attention to who or what is the subject in each. Ensure to wrap your selected answer including its justification between <answer> and </answer>.

Consider the following examples for better contextual understanding:
Example 1: Suppose the premise is 'Steven remembers that John believes Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'John believes Sara has a book', select 'entailment' because Steven's memory directly proves that John does indeed believe Sara has a book. John's belief essentially becomes the factor to be proved here, not Sara's book ownership.

Example 2: If the premise is 'Alex tells that David saw Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter is giving a speech on stage', opt for 'non-entailment'. We only get to know that David saw Peter giving a speech based on Alex's statement, but this does not provide irrefutable proof of Peter actually giving a speech on stage.

Example 3: If the premise states 'Mandy believes that she heard from Bob that John owns a green car', and the hypothesis is 'Bob has stated that John owns a green car', select 'entailment'. Here, Mandy's belief gives solid proof that Bob has made such a statement. Note that the hypothesis is not about John's car color but about Bob's statement.

Once you comprehend the previous examples, examine the relationship between the following premise and hypothesis. Your answer should entail either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Also, remember to provide a succinct reasoning for your selection.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph knows that James suspects that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna. Hypothesis: James suspects that Joseph knows that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Justification: The premise clearly states that Joseph knows that James suspects a specific scenario involving a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna. The hypothesis directly reflects this scenario, indicating that James suspects that Joseph knows about it. Therefore, the premise provides concrete evidence that supports the hypothesis, leading to entailment.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Error Type: Misinterpretation. The model seems to have misunderstood the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. It treated the premise (Joseph knowing that James suspects a woman wearing a red hat is being followed) and the hypothesis that (James suspects that Joseph knows this) as equivalent statements, when they are not. Just because Joseph has knowledge of something does not necessarily mean that James suspects that Joseph has this knowledge.

2. Justification Unsoundness: The justification provided by the model is logically unsound. It omits the fact that the existence of knowledge on Joseph's part does not per se involve James's suspicion about that knowledge. In other words, Joseph's knowledge does not automatically equate to James's awareness of that knowledge.

3. Transposition Inaccuracy: The model failed to recognize the transposed subjects between the premise and the hypothesis. While the premises deal with Joseph's knowledge, the hypothesis deals with what James suspects about that knowledge. Without clear evidence that James is aware of Joseph's knowledge, the correct answer should be non-entailment.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Delineate difference between entailment and non-entailment more clearly: Ensure that the model understands the difference between a premise providing absolute proof of a hypothesis versus merely hinting towards it.

2. Illustrate more complex examples: The provided examples to guide the model are relatively straightforward. Including more complex examples can better inform the model about nuances in language and logic, helping it make better decisions.

3. Improve Prompts about Subject Misalignment: The model exhibited challenges with sentences where the subjects between the premise and the hypothesis have been transposed (Joseph knows vs. James suspects Joseph knows). Upgrading the prompt to explicitly address such cases could improve performance.

4. Implement a mechanism for question taxonomy: If the model had a measure to classify questions into various categories (like subject misalignment, information deficit, etc), this could enable it to use more accurate judgment when dealing with various types of relationship analyses. This categorization could shape the strategy for logic inference and lead to better output.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'. It's crucial to remember that the perspective of an individual, including their perceived assumptions or beliefs, cannot constitute concrete evidence of objective reality. 

Provide your answer by choosing from the available options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Let's examine these examples to better understand: 

Example 1: Premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since an assumption does not provide concrete evidence of Sara having a book. 

Example 2: Premise is 'David observes Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', because observation provides direct, concrete evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Example 3: Premise is 'Mandy said that she heard from her friend that John has a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John has a green car', you should select 'non-entailment' since hearsay does not provide solid proof of John's car color.

After identifying the relation between the following premise and hypothesis, choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', remember to provide a succinct justification for your selection. 
Premise: Provide premise here
Hypothesis: Provide hypothesis here
Options:
(A) entailment

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph knows that James suspects that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna. Hypothesis: James suspects that Joseph knows that a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Justification: The premise clearly states that Joseph knows that James suspects a specific scenario involving a woman wearing a red hat and red bandanna followed by a man in a red bandanna. The hypothesis directly reflects this scenario, indicating that James suspects that Joseph knows about it. Therefore, the premise provides concrete evidence that supports the hypothesis, leading to entailment.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Error Type: Misinterpretation. The model seems to have misunderstood the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. It treated the premise (Joseph knowing that James suspects a woman wearing a red hat is being followed) and the hypothesis that (James suspects that Joseph knows this) as equivalent statements, when they are not. Just because Joseph has knowledge of something does not necessarily mean that James suspects that Joseph has this knowledge.

2. Justification Unsoundness: The justification provided by the model is logically unsound. It omits the fact that the existence of knowledge on Joseph's part does not per se involve James's suspicion about that knowledge. In other words, Joseph's knowledge does not automatically equate to James's awareness of that knowledge.

3. Transposition Inaccuracy: The model failed to recognize the transposed subjects between the premise and the hypothesis. While the premises deal with Joseph's knowledge, the hypothesis deals with what James suspects about that knowledge. Without clear evidence that James is aware of Joseph's knowledge, the correct answer should be non-entailment.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Delineate difference between entailment and non-entailment more clearly: Ensure that the model understands the difference between a premise providing absolute proof of a hypothesis versus merely hinting towards it.

2. Illustrate more complex examples: The provided examples to guide the model are relatively straightforward. Including more complex examples can better inform the model about nuances in language and logic, helping it make better decisions.

3. Improve Prompts about Subject Misalignment: The model exhibited challenges with sentences where the subjects between the premise and the hypothesis have been transposed (Joseph knows vs. James suspects Joseph knows). Upgrading the prompt to explicitly address such cases could improve performance.

4. Implement a mechanism for question taxonomy: If the model had a measure to classify questions into various categories (like subject misalignment, information deficit, etc), this could enable it to use more accurate judgment when dealing with various types of relationship analyses. This categorization could shape the strategy for logic inference and lead to better output.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify the logical entailment between premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' if the hypothesis is necessarily true given the premise, or 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't necessarily true given the premise. Provide your answer in parentheses.
(2) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the hypothesis can be fully proved strictly based on the information in the premise, select 'entailment'. If the hypothesis cannot be definitively proved using only the premise, select 'non-entailment'. Remember, someone's perception or belief is not a proof of the objective truth. Provide your answer between the options provided, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples: 

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since John's assumption does not prove definite ownership of the book by Sara. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'David witnesses that Peter gives a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', since David's witnessing provides direct evidence of Peter giving a speech on stage.
(3) Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'.

<START>

Analyze the relationship between the provided premise and the corresponding hypothesis. For a choice of 'entailment', the premise must contain irrefutable evidence enabling the full affirmation of the hypothesis. Conversely, 'non-entailment' should be chosen in the absence of concrete evidence. Assumptions, beliefs, perceptions, suspicions, or hearsay can direct towards a possibility but do not corroborate the hypothesis as an objective fact. Remember, individual perspectives and inferred conjectures are not solid pieces of evidence for an objective truth.

After assessing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', providing a brief explanation of your choice in your answer. In your explanation, be sure to address whether there's any possible scenario where the hypothesis is not true given the premise. Choose your answer from the options bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Consider the following examples:

Example 1: If the premise is 'John suspects that Sara owns a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara owns a book', you should choose 'non-entailment', because John's suspicions do not offer incontrovertible proof that Sara owns a book. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'Ben said he directly witnessed Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gave a speech on stage', you should choose 'entailment', as Ben's direct witnessing provides unambiguous evidence of the event. 

Example 3: If the premise is 'Mandy mentioned that her friend thinks John owns a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John owns a green car', you should choose 'non-entailment', as a third party's belief doesn't constitute hard evidence. 

Exercise caution in cases where the premise and the hypothesis involve different subjects. A person's knowledge or belief does not necessarily mean the other individual is conscious of it in the same aspect.

Now, provided below are premise and hypothesis. Identify the relationship between them, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the given wrong example:

1. In the premise, James' belief is that Richard understands the situation about three women. However, the hypothesis directly states that Richard does understand the situation. The prompt instructs the model to treat beliefs, assumptions, and perspectives as independent among different individuals in the premise. 

However, the model incorrectly treated James' belief about Richard as a fact about Richard, leading to an error. The assumption of James doesn't necessarily prove the truth about Richard's understanding. James could be mistaken about Richard's understanding. Hence, the result should be 'non-entailment'.

2. The prompt explicitly states to consider only conclusive facts mentioned in the premise to support the truth of the hypothesis. It advises avoiding incidental details, yet it fails to encourage the model to distinguish between subjective statements and objective truths within the provided statement. Here, the model misunderstood an indirect mention (James thinks that Richard understands) as a direct fact (Richard understands), which resulted in the wrong output.

3. Complexity and ambiguity can arise with subjective phrases like "any conceivable scenario" or "any possible scenario". These phrases might have been interpreted by the model as including scenarios where an individual's belief equals a fact, which is incorrect.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. More specificity in distinguishing between subjective thoughts/beliefs and concrete facts. The prompt should clarify that a belief or assumption of one individual about another doesn't equate to a fact about the latter.

2. Make explicit that the model should avoid considering individual perspectives and assumptions as objective truths that ensure the validity of the hypothesis. 

3. Provide clearer instructions to the model regarding the interpretation of "any conceivable scenario" or "any possible scenario", instructing it not to take into account unrealistic or implausible scenarios where beliefs are treated as equivalent to facts.

4. More clarity on the concept of 'entailment'. Explanation or example in the prompt which highlights that entailment should be based on direct information from the premise and not inferred from an individual's belief, for instance.

Example 1:

For this example: "Taylor knows that William suspects that a man with a gray beard and a little boy are sitting on the floor looking over some papers in a room with a bunk bed", the model predicted '(B) non-entailment', while the correct answer is '(A) entailment'. Here are the possible reasons why:

1. Misinterpretation of the Premise: The model might have misinterpreted the premise and misunderstood the logical relationship. It could have interpreted the premise as Taylor's belief rather than factual information.

2. Confusion with Independent Beliefs: As per the prompt, the model may have treated beliefs, assumptions, and perspectives as independent among different individuals in the premise. This could have led the model to overlook the fact that 'William suspects' is a part of Taylor's knowledge.

Example 2: 

For this example: "Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors", the model predicted '(A) entailment', while the correct answer is '(B) non-entailment'. Here are possible reasons why:

1. Misapplying the Entailment Definition: The model might have wrongly applied the definition of 'entailment'. It may have concluded that because the hypothesis statement is included verbatim in the premise, it must be an entailment.

2. Overlooking Subjectivity of Belief: The model might have overlooked the subjectivity of 'belief' mentioned in the scenario. It didn't differentiate between Richard's belief, and the factual accuracy of Joseph's knowledge.

Based on these problems, the prompt can be improved in the following ways:

1. Specify Interpretation of Beliefs and Knowledge: The prompt should clarify how to treat the knowledge, beliefs, or suspicions a person has regarding the beliefs of another person.

2. Clarify the Independence of Beliefs: It should be explicitly stated how independent beliefs interact in case of entailment or non-entailment.

3. Elaborate on the Entailment and Non-entailment Definitions: The prompt could further elaborate on the difference between entailment and non-entailment, using more examples to illustrate these concepts.

4. Addressing Incidental Details: The prompt could better explain what constitutes as 'incidental details' in a premise. Include more guidance on how to disregard these details without missing crucial information.

5. Reinforce Correct Answer Format: It should ensure that model responses stick to the required answer format, regardless of the complexity of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Incorrect Interpretation of the Information - The most apparent issue in the example is the misconception on the part of the model concerning the source of the information. In the premise, it is mentioned that "Richard assumes" the given situation, implying that this might not necessarily be Abigail's actual perception of the event. This confusion has led the model to decide the wrong answer. 

2. Misunderstanding of Individual Perspectives - As specified in the prompt, perspectives, assumptions, and beliefs must be treated as independent. However, the model failed to consider that Richard's assumption about Abigail's thoughts is independent from what Abigail actually thinks, leading to incorrect inference.

3. Overemphasis on Detail Continuity - The model seemed to focus excessively on the details shared between the premise and hypothesis. Despite the disparity between the separate perspectives, the continuity of details might have led the model to choose entailment.

4. Neglecting the Definition of Entailment - The model ignored the definition of entailment provided in the prompt. For "entailment", any conceivable scenario would make the hypothesis true based on the premise. But in this case, it's not necessarily true that Abigail thinks the way Richard assumes.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify the Definitions - Make the definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' more clear and explicit in the instructions, providing examples if needed.

2. Further Emphasize Individual Differences - Reinforce that the perspectives and assumptions of different individuals in the premise may differ and are regarded as independent. This emphasis will encourage the model to discriminate between individual viewpoints.

3. Encourage Critical Analysis - Advise the model to not only match the details in the scenario described in the premise and the hypothesis but also skeptically examine the source, reliability and likelihood of the information.

4. Focus on Source of Information - Specify that the model needs to focus on the true source of information, especially when multiple individuals' beliefs and assumptions are involved in the premise.

5. Use Simpler Language - Ensure the clarity of instructions by avoiding over complication of sentences, which can impede understanding.

Example 1 Analysis:
In the first example, the premise indicates that "Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors." However, the hypothesis is about what Joseph actually knows. The mistake happened because the model understood Richard's belief to be an accurate representation of Joseph's knowledge. Similar to the old saying 'appearance vs. reality', Richard's belief may not represent the truth about Joseph’s knowledge, and this logical gap is what broke the entailment here. The correct label should, therefore, be 'non-entailment'.

Example 2 Analysis:
The second example exhibits the same logical pattern as the first. The premise involves the character Abigail's belief about what Emma knows. The model again neglected the logical difference between Abigail's belief and Emma's actual knowledge, classifying the relationship as 'entailment' when it should have been 'non-entailment'.

Common Mistake:
Both of these misconstrued inputs involve characters' beliefs about what other characters know, which the model has misinterpreted as a factual information about the characters' knowledge. This misunderstanding seems to stem from the model not correctly distinguishing between someone believing in something and that thing being inherently true.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Explicitly state that beliefs and assumptions of one character about another's knowledge do not necessarily entail the reality of the latter's knowledge.
2. Include reminders that humans’ beliefs are not always accurate, and knowledge can differ from person to person.
3. Increase clarity around 'non-entailment', explaining what conditions lead to it and more examples.
4. Explicit examples of the difference between beliefs and known truths in the context of entailment and non-entailment.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Please note, entailment is when the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second, while non-entailment is when the truth of the first statement does not necessitate the truth of the second. Don't confuse this with causal attribution. When answering, enclose your answer in <answer> and </answer> brackets.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Please note, entailment is when the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second, while non-entailment is when the truth of the first statement does not necessitate the truth of the second. Don't confuse this with causal attribution. When answering, enclose your answer in <answer> and </answer> brackets.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors. Hypothesis: Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Please note, entailment is when the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second, while non-entailment is when the truth of the first statement does not necessitate the truth of the second.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail believes that Emma knows that navy men stand along a red carpet and salute as their superior walks by. Hypothesis: Emma knows that navy men stand along a red carpet and salute as their superior walks by.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1 Analysis:
In the first example, the premise indicates that "Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors." However, the hypothesis is about what Joseph actually knows. The mistake happened because the model understood Richard's belief to be an accurate representation of Joseph's knowledge. Similar to the old saying 'appearance vs. reality', Richard's belief may not represent the truth about Joseph’s knowledge, and this logical gap is what broke the entailment here. The correct label should, therefore, be 'non-entailment'.

Example 2 Analysis:
The second example exhibits the same logical pattern as the first. The premise involves the character Abigail's belief about what Emma knows. The model again neglected the logical difference between Abigail's belief and Emma's actual knowledge, classifying the relationship as 'entailment' when it should have been 'non-entailment'.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example 1:

The question was about the logical relationship between a premise (Ava believes that Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping) and a hypothesis (Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping). The model incorrectly chose 'entailment' as the logical relationship. This is because the model seems to entirely focus on the content of both statements (Emma suspects that three kids perform a skit about camping), and not on how the statements are framed. The premise only tells us what Ava believes, it doesn't guarantee that Emma actually suspects it. Thus, the truth of the premise doesn't automatically necessitate the truth of the hypothesis.

For Example 2:

A similar issue arises. Although the text within both the premise and the hypothesis is the same (Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines), the premise doesn't directly entail the hypothesis. This is because the premise is mediated by another subject's belief (James thinks that...), not by a direct assertion. 

In both these scenarios, the model appears to be struggling with the concept of indirect knowledge or belief. Essentially, just because one character believes something about another character's knowledge or belief, it does not guarantee that the assumed knowledge or belief is true. 

To improve the prompt:
1. Emphasize the difference between someone's belief about something and the actual truth or validity of that thing.
2. Place more emphasis on the part of the prompt that explains 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'.
3. Add examples that demonstrate when one character's belief doesn't necessitate an entailment; this could help the model understand the intricacies around indirect knowledge or belief.
4. Consider redefining 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to be more explicit about the logical necessities. More specifically, provide definitions that detail that the second statement must be unequivocally true if the first one is true for it to be 'entailment'.

gradient:
Example 1: 

In the given scenario the prompt is requesting the model to identify the logical relationship (either entailment or non-entailment) between two statements. In the example, the premise is that "Sophia thinks that Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background" and the hypothesis is that "Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background."

The model provided an answer of entailment (Option A) but the correct answer is non-entailment (Option B). The mistake here is due to the fact that while Sophia's thought may suggest that Robert suspects certain things, it does not conclusively entail that Robert does indeed suspect these things.

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1. Misinterpretation of indirect speech: The model might be misinterpreting the indirect speech. Even though in the premise, Sophia thinks that Robert suspects something, it doesn't entail that Robert does suspect that. It is just Sophia's belief or perspective, which can be inaccurate. 

2. Failure to distinguish between assumption and reality: The model seems to confuse Sophia's views or beliefs (which might be based on her own assumptions) with the reality of Robert's suspicions. It's failing to discriminate between inference and direct statements.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify the definitions of entailment and non-entailment: While the prompt provides definitions of both terms, it could be beneficial to further clarify these. For instance, it could emphasize that entailment requires undeniable logical cohesion and not merely suggestive or indirect association.

2. Use simpler examples: The prompt could use simpler sentences as examples to explain the difference between entailment and non-entailment, thereby providing the model with a more precise understanding of what is being asked.

3. Introduce more context: The prompt could elaborate more on the examples. Statements that include indirect speech and complex sentence structures might be confusing for the model. 

4. Emphasize on the discernment between perspectives and actual conditions: Explicitly added instructions could be beneficial such as "Don't confuse a character's thought, belief, or perspective with reality for entailment."

Premise: Sophia thinks that Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background. Hypothesis: Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1: 

In the given scenario the prompt is requesting the model to identify the logical relationship (either entailment or non-entailment) between two statements. In the example, the premise is that "Sophia thinks that Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background" and the hypothesis is that "Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background."

The model provided an answer of entailment (Option A) but the correct answer is non-entailment (Option B). The mistake here is due to the fact that while Sophia's thought may suggest that Robert suspects certain things, it does not conclusively entail that Robert does indeed suspect these things.

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1. Misinterpretation of indirect speech: The model might be misinterpreting the indirect speech. Even though in the premise, Sophia thinks that Robert suspects something, it doesn't entail that Robert does suspect that. It is just Sophia's belief or perspective, which can be inaccurate. 

2. Failure to distinguish between assumption and reality: The model seems to confuse Sophia's views or beliefs (which might be based on her own assumptions) with the reality of Robert's suspicions. It's failing to discriminate between inference and direct statements.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify the definitions of entailment and non-entailment: While the prompt provides definitions of both terms, it could be beneficial to further clarify these. For instance, it could emphasize that entailment requires undeniable logical cohesion and not merely suggestive or indirect association.

2. Use simpler examples: The prompt could use simpler sentences as examples to explain the difference between entailment and non-entailment, thereby providing the model with a more precise understanding of what is being asked.

3. Introduce more context: The prompt could elaborate more on the examples. Statements that include indirect speech and complex sentence structures might be confusing for the model. 

4. Emphasize on the discernment between perspectives and actual conditions: Explicitly added instructions could be beneficial such as "Don't confuse a character's thought, belief, or perspective with reality for entailment."

Example 1:

Question: 
Premise: Thomas assumes that Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium. 
Hypothesis: Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium.

Model's Wrong Answer: 
<answer>Non-entailment</answer>

Analysis: 
The model appears to have misunderstood the task by focusing on the personal belief of Thomas about Robert's thinking. This is despite the prompts attempting to clarify that the character's belief does not represent reality. This suggests the prompt needs to reiterate and emphasize the distinction between a character's belief and the truth of a premise or hypothesis. 

Example 2:

Question: 
Premise: Emma remembers that a group of young men are dumping soil onto the ground of their backyard. 
Hypothesis: James remembers that the young men are working outside.

Model's Wrong Answer: 
<answer>Non-entailment</answer>

Analysis: 
Again, the model seems to fall into the trap of focusing on the characters' views (Emma and James in this case) rather than genuinely evaluating the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. 

Areas for improvement:
1. Clarity: Simplify the instructions and reiterate that the task is about the logical relationship between two statements, not about the perspectives of the characters mentioned in these statements. 
2. Examples: Provide examples of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' so the model has a clear reference point.
3. Definitions: The definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' could be clearer. A reframed definition could include explicit instructions that the characters' beliefs or perspectives in the statements do not influence whether one statement necessarily leads to another's truth.
4. Distinction: Reiterate that the reality of the subject matter and the perspectives of the characters mentioned are two separate things and should not be confused. Emphasize that a task involving the identification of a logical relationship should focus on the statements' content, not on the characters' beliefs. 

Example Revised Prompt:
Your task is to identify the logical relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Choose between 'entailment', when the truth of the first statement (the premise) requires the second statement (the hypothesis) to be true, or 'non-entailment', when the truth of the first statement does not necessitate the truth of the second. This task has nothing to do with the beliefs or knowledge of characters mentioned in the statements, but focuses solely on the content of the statements themselves. Ignore any information related to characters' perspectives and focus on the logical relationship.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the First Example:
The prompt falls short because it overemphasizes the concept of inference through belief but doesn't adequately address discerning between hypothesis and direct information. It asks the model to consider the beliefs or assumptions a character makes, which doesn’t implicitly imply the truth of the given situation. However, it fails to highlight that assumptions can also be faulty.

For the model's response, the assumption made remains an assumption and does not necessarily translate to factual reality, as stated in the hypothesis. The model assumed that Richard's assumption necessarily validates Abigail's thought, which is incorrect.

For the Second Example:
The model seems to misinterpret the premises and hypotheses relationship. The possibility of a confusion between a presumption and a belief could be the reason behind this confusion. The prompt accentuates the need to differentiate between reality and a character's belief, but it does not give enough weight to the logical relationship that needs to be identified between the premises and hypotheses. 

In this context, Thomas's assumption about Robert's belief might be incorrect, yet the model chose assumption as an implication of Robert's belief being true.

To Improve the Prompt:

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Identify the logical relationship between the premises and hypotheses, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember that 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second. Contrastingly, 'non-entailment' occurs when the truth of the first statement does not obligate the truth of the second. Keep in mind that the beliefs or assumptions a character makes about another's knowledge do not inherently represent the reality of the latter's knowledge. In other words, a character's belief about something doesn't automatically make it true. So, ensure you distinguish between a character's belief about another's knowledge and the reality of that knowledge. Don't confuse this task with causal attribution. When providing your answer, enclose it in <answer> and </answer> brackets. Consider all these as you analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building. Hypothesis: Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas assumes that Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium. Hypothesis: Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>Non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For the First Example:
The prompt falls short because it overemphasizes the concept of inference through belief but doesn't adequately address discerning between hypothesis and direct information. It asks the model to consider the beliefs or assumptions a character makes, which doesn’t implicitly imply the truth of the given situation. However, it fails to highlight that assumptions can also be faulty.

For the model's response, the assumption made remains an assumption and does not necessarily translate to factual reality, as stated in the hypothesis. The model assumed that Richard's assumption necessarily validates Abigail's thought, which is incorrect.

For the Second Example:
The model seems to misinterpret the premises and hypotheses relationship. The possibility of a confusion between a presumption and a belief could be the reason behind this confusion. The prompt accentuates the need to differentiate between reality and a character's belief, but it does not give enough weight to the logical relationship that needs to be identified between the premises and hypotheses. 

In this context, Thomas's assumption about Robert's belief might be incorrect, yet the model chose assumption as an implication of Robert's belief being true.

To Improve the Prompt:
1. In the instruction, stress that an assumption, even if it's about another character's belief, does not constitute concrete evidence validating the truth of the assumption. Just because a character assumes something about someone else's belief does not make the belief true.
   
2. Highlight the need to keep the interpretation of the statements strictly logical and within the information provided. Advice not to draw upon outside assumptions or biases towards outcomes.

3. To avoid confusion with causal attribution, extensively exemplify entailment and non-entailment, giving models a clear understanding of what exactly they are supposed to understand and identify.

4. State explicitly the difference between someone assuming a belief of another person and the actual belief of that person.

In essence, the aim is to clarify understanding between the concept of belief, assumption, and actual knowledge when providing instructions to the model. This fine tuning will facilitate a more accurate determination of entailment and non-entailment relationships.

<START> Your task is to identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The premise is your foundational statement, while the hypothesis is a derived supposition. In this context, 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the premise necessarily validates the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, 'non-entailment' arises when the truth of the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis's truth. Often, character assumptions about another character's belief will be presented. However, remember that an assumption about a belief is not confirmation of the belief itself. Ensure you critically analyze the information provided within the text rather than making unwarranted external assumptions. Note that this task is not about causation or attribution.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Lack of clarification about inference: The prompt doesn't clearly instruct the model how to handle situations where assumptions or beliefs are involved, which causes confusion. In the given example, it's Ava's belief about Emma's suspicion, not an established fact. The model misinterpreted this detail and incorrectly assumed entailment, even though Ava's belief doesn't necessarily make the hypothesis true. 

2. Handling ambiguity: The prompt doesn't give clear instructions on handling ambiguous situations. In the example, Emma's suspects or Ava's belief may not reflect the truth of the situation. The model should have been directed to handle this type of ambiguity by not treating such statements as factual.

3. Detailed instruction on knowledge representation: The prompt instructs the model to differentiate between a character's knowledge and the reality. However, it does not provide detailed instructions on how to apply this knowledge when determining the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses. As a result, the model fails to correctly interpret situations when beliefs are involved.

4. Lack of clarity in defining 'entailment' and 'non-entailment': There might be a confusion for the model in the definitions of the 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The instructions need to be more precise on how truth of the first statement affects the truth of the second when there are beliefs intertwined.

To improve the prompt:

1. Add clear instructions: Instruct the model to not treat beliefs or assumptions as factual information when working out the logical relationship of premises and hypotheses. 

2. Specify instruction for ambiguous information: Guide the model on handling ambiguous situations by including specifications about such scenarios in the prompt.

3. Provide detailed instructions on knowledge representation: Expand on how the model should distinguish between a character's belief and the actual state of affairs in its analysis.

4. Define 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' more clearly: Make the definitions absolute and clear to help the model in decision making.

<1>

Question: Sophia thinks that Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background. Hypothesis: Robert suspects that three people hiking up a mountain with a river and other mountains in the background.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Reason: The prompt stipulates that "the belief of a character regarding another character's knowledge or belief doesn't necessarily uphold the truth of such knowledge or belief." Therefore, just because Sophia thinks that Robert suspects something, does not necessarily mean that Robert actually suspects it. However, the model incorrectly perceives an 'entailment' relationship here.

<2>

Question: David remembers that Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man and a woman are dancing in the crowd.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Reason: The model misunderstands the relationship here. According to the instructions given in the prompt, the fact that David remembers Richard making an assumption does not affect the validity of Richard's assumption. Yet, the prompt can be misinterpreted if not careful, leading the model to choose 'non-entailment.

<3>

Question: Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors. Hypothesis: Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Reason: Again, the model fails to correctly apply the prompt's advice that what one character believes about another's knowledge does not necessarily make it a fact. Richard's belief about Joseph’s knowledge doesn't guarantee that Joseph truly knows the fact.

<4>

Question: Abigail believes that Emma knows that navy men stand along a red carpet and salute as their superior walks by. Hypothesis: Emma knows that navy men stand along a red carpet and salute as their superior walks by.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Reason: The model falls again into the trap of assuming that one person's belief about another person's knowledge automatically translates into fact. According to the prompt, this is not necessarily true, leading to a 'non-entailment' relationship, not 'entailment.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Clarify within the prompt that another person's belief, assumption, or memory about someone else's thought, knowledge, or belief doesn't necessarily mean that the latter's thought, knowledge, or belief is true.
   
2. Add specific examples within the prompt to illustrate how the model should interpret situations similar to those it got wrong.

3. Emphasize the principle that the belief of a character regarding another character's knowledge or belief doesn't necessarily uphold the truth of such knowledge or belief more strongly in the prompt.

4. Make the difference between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' clearer in the prompt.

5. Provide more context and explanation in the prompt about how to treat different sources or bases of beliefs (e.g. memory, assumption) in determining entailment.

response:
<START> 

Your task is to identify the logical relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to the scenario where if the first statement (premise) is undeniably true, then the second statement (hypothesis) is also irrefutably true. Conversely, 'non-entailment' implies that if the first statement is true, the second statement does not have to be true. 

It is critical to differentiate this from causal attribution, as this task focuses on logic, not cause-effect relationships. It is important, particularly in situations where a character's belief about another's thought, belief, or knowledge is concerned, to remember that a belief about another person's knowledge does not necessarily confirm the truth of that knowledge. For instance, if Sophia believes Robert suspects something, it doesn't mean Robert actually suspects it.

Your judgment should be based on the logical relationship between the two statements, not the source or holder of the belief. Consequently, the fact that if David remembers something does not influence the validity of the memory itself. Similarly, one person’s belief about another person’s knowledge does not confirm the latter's knowledge as fact.

When you have decided whether the relationship is one of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', provide your answer enclosed within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

Reasons for the Wrong Answer

1. Misinterpretation of the Character's Belief: The model seems to have misunderstood the instruction relating to character belief leading to a wrong assumption. It incorrectly assumes that if James thinks Richard understands a situation, then Richard does indeed understand. The prompt should have clarified that a character's belief about another person's knowledge isn't equivalent to actual knowledge.

2. Misunderstanding of Entailment Concept: The model has confused the logical relationship of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. The initial premise is about James's belief or perception, which never guarantees Richard's actual understanding - a classic non-entailment situation. This indicates a misunderstanding of the concept as explained in the prompt.

3. Lack of Clarity in the Prompt's Explanation: The explanations provided for 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt might lack clarity needed for the model. This could have led the model to incorrectly classify the relationship as 'entailment'.

Improvements for the Prompt

1. Clarify Character Belief: Make explicit mention that a character's belief about another character's knowledge does not equate to that knowledge or understanding being true.

2. Improve Definitions: Provide clearer, more precise definitions of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Incorporate examples that distinctly illustrate these logical relationships.

3. Contextual Examples: Introduce examples that specifically involve scenarios where characters are involved, along with their beliefs and perceptions, and how to treat such cases. 

4. Explicitly Instruct on Assumptions: Emphasize that the model should not make assumptions beyond what is plainly stated in the given premise.

On the other hand, 'non-entailment' exists when if the first statement is true, the second statement does not necessarily have to be true. This logical connection differs from causal attribution. Importantly, keep in mind that the belief of a character regarding another character's knowledge or belief doesn't necessarily uphold the truth of such knowledge or belief. When providing the answer, enclose it within <answer> and </answer> brackets.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

<START> Determine the logical relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, which could either be an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. By definition, 'entailment' exists when if the first statement or premise is undeniably true, then the second statement or hypothesis must also be absolutely true. Alternatively, 'non-entailment' exists when if the first statement or premise is true, the second statement or hypothesis does not necessarily have to be true. Please note, this task evaluates the logical connections and is not about finding causal relationships. Moreover, when a premise describes a character's belief about another character's knowledge, it does not confirm the latter's understanding. In other words, even if a character believes that another character knows or understands something, this belief does not necessarily make it true. Thus, do not make assumptions beyond what is stated in the premises. Identify the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

The model's response: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>
The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Reason for Incorrect Response: This problem largely rises from a misunderstanding of the underlying nature of the premise and hypothesis. In this case, James's belief about what Richard understands is the premise, and this doesn't necessarily mean that Richard does indeed understand what James thinks he understands. The model seems to overlook the perspective and subjective understanding elements present in these types of questions.

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert remembers that Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair. Hypothesis: Richard assumes that a man examines his facial hair.

(B) non-entailment

The model's response: The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Robert remembers that Richard assumes something, it does not necessarily mean that Richard actually assumes that thing. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>
The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Reason for Incorrect Response: Again, the model seems to misunderstand the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. In this situation, the premise and hypothesis statement are identical. The fact that Robert remembers what Richard assumes doesn't change what Richard assumes or not. The model seems to be overcomplicating the logical relationship in these types of questions.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Elaborate on the importance of recognizing the subjective nature of characters' beliefs or understandings and how this doesn't necessarily reflect reality or the truth of what other characters know or believe. Add clarification that the task is not about validating the truth of the characters' beliefs or perceptions but identifying the logical relationship between the given premise and hypothesis.
2. Add more explanations and examples to illustrate the differences between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' relationships, particularly focusing on cases where beliefs, thought, and perceptions of one character about another are involved.
3. In the case of identical premises and hypotheses, expressly state that this usually implies an 'entailment' relationship, unless there is a clear indication in the context otherwise.
4. Specify that overcomplication or over-analysis of the logical relationship should be avoided, and focus should be on the statements' straightforward logical relationship.

In general, refining and simplifying the instructions related to handling premises regarding characters' beliefs or perceptions might help the model perform better on similar inputs.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this example, the model incorrectly identifies the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as entailment. The model seems to misunderstand that even though the content of what Emma suspects in the premise is the same as the hypothesis, the premise does not provide direct evidence that Emma does suspect that three kids perform a skit about camping. This mistake could be the result of the prompt not adequately stressing that indirect reporting of belief (i.e., "Ava believes that Emma suspects") does not entail the direct report of the belief (i.e., "Emma suspects").

<2> The same issue arises in this example, where the model wrongly identifies the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as entailment. Here, the model assumes that because Thomas believes Robert has a specific belief, this means that Robert does indeed have that belief. The prompt should emphasize that it is not enough for someone to believe another person holds a belief for that belief to be true.

<3> The model makes the same mistake in this third example as well, misconstruing indirect belief as confirming the direct statement of the belief. It infers that since Sophia thinks Robert suspects something, it must be true. The model seems to fail in understanding the nuance within indirect belief assertions.

<4> Again, indirect reporting of a belief (i.e., "Richard assumes") is wrongly taken by the model as proving the direct report of the belief (i.e., "Abigail thinks").

In all examples, the model does not correctly understand that someone's belief about another person's belief or suspicion does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the latter person truly holds that belief or suspicion. This error seems to stem from the prompt not emphasizing the complexity behind indirect belief or suspicion reporting.

And so, to improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize the difference between direct and indirect reporting of beliefs or suspicions.

2. Stress the fact that someone's belief about another person's belief or suspicion doesn't affirm the belief or suspicion of the latter individual.

3. Adapt the prompt wording to allow the model to focus on the source of the belief or suspicion, which might help the model to better compare the premise and hypothesis. 

4. Add an extra instruction to encourage the model not to take someone's belief about another person’s belief at face value. For example: "When evaluating the entailment, consider who is reporting the belief or suspicion in the premise and compare it to the belief or suspicion reported in the hypothesis.”

5. Finally, the inclusion of examples showing the difference between direct and indirect reporting might also be beneficial, to provide context and guidance to the model.

Premise: Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building. Hypothesis: Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building.

(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> In this example, the model incorrectly identifies the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as entailment. The model seems to misunderstand that even though the content of what Emma suspects in the premise is the same as the hypothesis, the premise does not provide direct evidence that Emma does suspect that three kids perform a skit about camping. This mistake could be the result of the prompt not adequately stressing that indirect reporting of belief (i.e., "Ava believes that Emma suspects") does not entail the direct report of the belief (i.e., "Emma suspects").

<2> The same issue arises in this example, where the model wrongly identifies the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis as entailment. Here, the model assumes that because Thomas believes Robert has a specific belief, this means that Robert does indeed have that belief. The prompt should emphasize that it is not enough for someone to believe another person holds a belief for that belief to be true.

<3> The model makes the same mistake in this third example as well, misconstruing indirect belief as confirming the direct statement of the belief. It infers that since Sophia thinks Robert suspects something, it must be true. The model seems to fail in understanding the nuance within indirect belief assertions.

<4> Again, indirect reporting of a belief (i.e., "Richard assumes") is wrongly taken by the model as proving the direct report of the belief (i.e., "Abigail thinks").

In all examples, the model does not correctly understand that someone's belief about another person's belief or suspicion does not provide enough evidence to conclude that the latter person truly holds that belief or suspicion. This error seems to stem from the prompt not emphasizing the complexity behind indirect belief or suspicion reporting.

And so, to improve the prompt:

1. Emphasize the difference between direct and indirect reporting of beliefs or suspicions.

2. Stress the fact that someone's belief about another person's belief or suspicion doesn't affirm the belief or suspicion of the latter individual.

3. Adapt the prompt wording to allow the model to focus on the source of the belief or suspicion, which might help the model to better compare the premise and hypothesis. 

4. Add an extra instruction to encourage the model not to take someone's belief about another person’s belief at face value. For example: "When evaluating the entailment, consider who is reporting the belief or suspicion in the premise and compare it to the belief or suspicion reported in the hypothesis.”

5. Finally, the inclusion of examples showing the difference between direct and indirect reporting might also be beneficial, to provide context and guidance to the model.

gradient:
Example 1:
In this case, the model failed to understand the difference in the given premise and the hypothesis. It failed to recognise that the presence of 'Joseph suspects' in the premise does not automatically equate to Isabella knowing the fact in the hypothesis. The prompt leads to the wrong answer as it does not clearly specify or provide guidelines on dealing with such implied or indirect information scenarios. 

Example 2:
Similar to the first example, the model failed because it didn't consider the indirect information 'Abigail believes' in the premise. The presence of 'belief' doesn't validate the truth of the hypothesis. The prompt might have lead to the wrong answer as it does not sufficiently guide the model to separate the 'belief' and 'knowledge' and examine their entailment relations.

Recommendations for Prompt Improvement:

1. The prompt can specify that the model should carefully consider any underlying meanings or indirect implications between premises and hypotheses.

2. Provide explicit instructions for the model to separate primary information from indirect information such as 'beliefs' or 'suspicions' in the premises.

3. Specify that not all information that appears to agree directly equates to 'entailment'. 

4. Add instructions to encourage the model to be alert to modifiers in the premises that might affect the level of certainty or truth in the hypotheses.

5. Ask the model to consider the logic relations of the given sentences. If the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise, it is entailment; otherwise, it is non-entailment. 

6. Include a section in the prompt asking the model to justify why it selected a particular option. This might help encourage a more detailed analysis from the model.

For this prompt, multiple reasons could lead to an incorrect answer:
- Ambiguity in understanding: While the prompt discusses the task of identifying the 'level of entailment,' this could cause some confusion for the language model. The 'level of entailment' could be interpreted as a direct or partial, creating ambiguity. 
- Misinterpretation of the context: In this example, the model failed to pick up the subjectivity in the premise statement. The prompt doesn't include instructions on how to differentiate subjective statements, leading to a misunderstanding of the 'entailment'.
- Instructions aren't clear: The instruction "determine the level of entailment" may not be clear for the model that it has to make an inference based on the presented premise and hypothesis. 

Improvement Points:
- Specify clear and differentiable terms for the language model to understand and eliminate ambiguity.
- The prompt could incorporate instructions about processing the subjectivity in statements.
- The prompt would benefit from explicit instructions directing the model to make an inference based on the logical validity of the premise leading to the hypothesis. 
- The prompt could be improved by better defining what entailment and non-entailment mean.

gradient:
Reason for Wrong Answer 1: Cognitive Error
In the given example, the model seems to have made a cognitive error in understanding the premise and hypothesis. While the premise is about Emma learning about a girl bouncing in a bounce house, the hypothesis is about Ava learning about a girl bouncing around. The information that Ava learns is not mentioned in the premise which results in a non-entailment. The model incorrectly concludes an entailment potentially due to confusion between the actions "bouncing in a bounce house" and "bouncing around."

Reason for Wrong Answer 2: Incorrect Entity Mapping
The model inaccurately maps the entities in the premise and hypothesis. Specifically, it wrongly perceives 'Emma' and 'Ava' as the same entity. This distinct difference in character refers to different implications. For instance, what Emma learns might not necessarily be what Ava learns unless there's a specific bridge linking the two.

Reason for Wrong Answer 3: False Assumption
The model made a false assumption that 'bouncing in a bounce house' and 'bouncing around' are the same. To be specific, bouncing around could occur anywhere, not necessarily in a bounce house.

Reason for Wrong Answer 4: Misinterpretation of Prompt Instructions
The prompt instructed the model not to confuse direct information with indirect information such as 'beliefs', 'suspicions', but it seems the model did not sufficiently differentiate this in its interpretation. Modifiers are not considered directly in its response process.

Improving Aspects:

1. Clarification in Instructions: The prompt could be improved by emphasizing the importance of accurately mapping entities in the premise to the hypothesis and making sure the actions in the scenarios are exactly the same for entailment.

2. Moderating Assumptions: The model should be instructed not to assume that synonymous terminologies or phrases mean the same thing, as it often depends on the context in which they're used.

3. Treating Direct Information: The model should be instructed to put more emphasis on differentiating 'direct information' and 'indirect information' and treat both types differently.

4. Explanation of Entailment: Adding more explicit details about what constitutes 'entailment' could help the model understand the concept better. For example, explaining that entailment is only present if all elements including entities, actions, and circumstances align in the premise and hypothesis.

4. Explanation of Entailment: Adding more explicit details about what constitutes 'entailment' could help the model understand the concept better. For example, explaining that entailment is only present if all elements including entities, actions, and circumstances align in the premise and hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

For this task, you will analyze the given premises and hypotheses' level of entailment based on logical coherence. Remember, it's crucial to accurately map entities i.e., characters, objects, and events mentioned in the premise and the hypothesis. Do not confuse 'direct information' with 'indirect information' or modifiers such as 'beliefs' or 'suspicions'. Be cautious about assuming synonymous terminologies to be identical – the context is key. Entailment is determined if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise, and all elements including entities, actions, and circumstances align in both.

Once you've made your consideration, select an option from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Afterwards, provide a brief justification for your chosen answer, explaining both the information and the logic which was used to reach this conclusion. 

Present your answer formatted between the brackets <answer> and </answer>. Include the chosen option from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' in brackets next to your answer. Follow the format: <answer>(chosen option) Justification: (brief explanation)</answer>.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, keeping in mind not to confuse direct information with indirect information such as 'beliefs', 'suspicions', or similar modifiers. Determine the level of entailment between them by considering if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise. Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. After selecting an option, provide a brief justification for your choice. Finally, present your answer along with the justification in the given options format, having the answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, keeping in mind not to confuse direct information with indirect information such as 'beliefs', 'suspicions', or similar modifiers. Determine the level of entailment between them by considering if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise. Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. After selecting an option, provide a brief justification for your choice. Finally, present your answer along with the justification in the given options format, having the answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

Justification: The premise explicitly states that James thinks Richard understands the situation described. Therefore, it logically follows that Richard understands the scenario as mentioned in the hypothesis.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given premises and hypotheses carefully, keeping in mind not to confuse direct information with indirect information such as 'beliefs', 'suspicions', or similar modifiers. Determine the level of entailment between them by considering if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise. Choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. After selecting an option, provide a brief justification for your choice.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles assumes that two women are tending to their herd of animals including cows and goats near a building made primarily of stone. Hypothesis: Charles assumes that the two women are taking care of a herd of animals.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

Justification: The premise states that Charles assumes two women are tending to their herd of animals including cows and goats near a stone building. However, the hypothesis only mentions that Charles assumes the two women are taking care of a herd of animals, without specifying the types of animals or the location. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be logically derived from the premise.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In this instance, the model misunderstood the instruction "not to confuse direct information with indirect information such as 'beliefs', 'suspicions', or similar modifiers". The premise states that "James thinks that Richard understands" a certain scenario. However, this is indirect information - it does not guarantee that Richard indeed understands the situation. It is only James's belief or assumption. The model erroneously interpreted this as a direct statement of truth, leading to the wrong conclusion of 'entailment'. This suggests that the model may lack a nuanced understanding of direct and indirect information.

Example 2:
In this scenario, the model failed to apply the principle of logical entailment correctly. The model saw the difference in the level of specificity between the premise and the hypothesis — the premise had more details about the types of animals and the location — and incorrectly decided this indicated 'non-entailment'. In reality, the more general statement (the hypothesis) can indeed be logically derived from a more specific one (the premise).

Prompt Improvement:
1. The instructions regarding direct and indirect information are embedded within a larger block of text, which might be difficult for the model to follow. Breaking this down into bullet points or separate sentences could improve clarity.
2. More explicit instruction or examples regarding the nature of 'beliefs', 'assumptions', and 'suspicions' as indirect information may increase the model's understanding.
3. Enhanced articulation on the principle of logical entailment, stressing that a more general statement can be derived from a more specific one, could be beneficial. It may also help to include examples for better understanding.
4. The model could be guided to identify 'entailment' not just on the basis of verbatim repetition of statements, but through the exploration of implied, yet logically connected constructs. 
5. Visualization of the expected output format mentioning the place for 'Justification' can help in reducing potential confusion. 
6. The model could be reminded at the beginning of the task about treating each task independently and using deduction over prediction, known as 'abduction'.

Identify and analyse the following premises and hypotheses. Keep in mind the following key concepts while doing so:
1. Understand the difference between direct and indirect information. For example, 'beliefs', 'assumptions', and 'suspicions' indicate indirect information - Therefore, do not just assume them as factual.
2. Understand logical entailment. For instance, a less specific statement (hypothesis) can be logically derived from a more specific one (premise). Similarly, the use of modifiers in a statement should not hinder your judgement.
3. Treat each task independently and use deduction over prediction.

After comprehension, determine if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise. Make a choice from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

gradient:
Example Issue:
In the example provided, the model gets the answer wrong because it misunderstands the meaning of 'tending to' in the context of the premise. The phrase 'tending to their herd of animals' clearly implies that the two women are taking care of the herd, making the hypothesis correctly entailed from the premise. The model's error may be due to a misunderstanding of the semantics of the phrase 'tending to'.

Prompt Improvement:

The failure of the model in this particular case indicates room for improvements on two primary aspects: understanding the semantic meaning and the necessary logic to discern entailment or non-entailment. The prompt might need to be tuned on the following facets-

1. Semantic Interpretation: It is crucial the model understands the actual meaning of certain phrases or words in context. In the existing prompt, there could be a need for explicit instructions about paying attention to the semantical interpretation of idiomatic expressions, phrases or terms used.

2. Logical Analysis: The model should logically analyse the text in a way that it can discern entailment. For instance, the fact that 'tending to a herd' inherently implies 'taking care of the herd' should be logically understandable by the model.

3. Clear Instructions: It might also be helpful to provide clearer instructions on the detection of entailment. You could guide the model by mentioning that the hypothesis is an entailment of the premise if the truth of the premise necessarily guarantees the truth of the hypothesis.

Based on these facets, a probable improved prompt could be-
"Analyze the given premises and hypotheses, taking care to understand the semantic meaning of phrases and words in their context. Evaluate logically if the hypothesis can be necessarily derived from the premise. For an entailment, the hypothesis must be guaranteed to be true if the premise is true. Select 'entailment' if this condition is met, or 'non-entailment' if it is not. Provide a brief justification for your choice.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'. It's crucial to remember that the perspective of an individual, including their perceived assumptions or beliefs, cannot constitute concrete evidence of objective reality. 

Provide your answer by choosing from the available options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Let's examine these examples to better understand: 

Example 1: Premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since an assumption does not provide concrete evidence of Sara having a book. 

Example 2: Premise is 'David observes Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', because observation provides direct, concrete evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Example 3: Premise is 'Mandy said that she heard from her friend that John has a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John has a green car', you should select 'non-entailment' since hearsay does not provide solid proof of John's car color.

After identifying the relation between the following premise and hypothesis, choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', remember to provide a succinct justification for your selection.

   reward: 0.7200 | Q: 0.7200 | uct: 3.3404 | cum_rewards: [0.72]
   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the provided premise and the corresponding hypothesis. For a choice of 'entailment', the premise must contain irrefutable evidence enabling the full affirmation of the hypothesis. Conversely, 'non-entailment' should be chosen in the absence of concrete evidence. Assumptions, beliefs, perceptions, suspicions, or hearsay can direct towards a possibility but do not corroborate the hypothesis as an objective fact. Remember, individual perspectives and inferred conjectures are not solid pieces of evidence for an objective truth.

After assessing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', providing a brief explanation of your choice in your answer. In your explanation, be sure to address whether there's any possible scenario where the hypothesis is not true given the premise. Choose your answer from the options bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Consider the following examples:

Example 1: If the premise is 'John suspects that Sara owns a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara owns a book', you should choose 'non-entailment', because John's suspicions do not offer incontrovertible proof that Sara owns a book. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'Ben said he directly witnessed Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gave a speech on stage', you should choose 'entailment', as Ben's direct witnessing provides unambiguous evidence of the event. 

Example 3: If the premise is 'Mandy mentioned that her friend thinks John owns a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John owns a green car', you should choose 'non-entailment', as a third party's belief doesn't constitute hard evidence. 

Exercise caution in cases where the premise and the hypothesis involve different subjects. A person's knowledge or belief does not necessarily mean the other individual is conscious of it in the same aspect.

Now, provided below are premise and hypothesis. Identify the relationship between them, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 
Premise: Provide your premise here
Hypothesis: Provide your hypothesis here
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

   prompt: Assess the logical relationship between the statement (premise) and the conclusion (hypothesis). If the hypothesis is unquestionably true given the information from the premise alone, then choose 'entailment'. If the hypothesis is not inevitably true strictly using the premise, opt for 'non-entailment'. Crucially, a person's belief, perception, or assumption is NOT an evidence of the objective fact. Your answer must come in the format <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples for clarity:

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book' and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', select 'non-entailment'. This illustrates the point that the assumption of an individual (John, in this case) doesn't guarantee Sara's possession of the book.

Example 2: If the premise states 'David sees that Peter gives a speech on stage' and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', select 'entailment'. This is because David's observation is a direct evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Please remember: if the premise is based solely on someone's perception, belief, or assumption, always select 'non-entailment'. If the premise gives directly observable and unquestionable evidence of the hypothesis, select 'entailment'.

Task: Analyze the logical relationship between each premise and hypothesis below, and select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as the case maybe. Write your answer, choosing from the options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Identify the logical relationship between the premises and hypotheses, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember that 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second. Contrastingly, 'non-entailment' occurs when the truth of the first statement does not obligate the truth of the second. Keep in mind that the beliefs or assumptions a character makes about another's knowledge do not inherently represent the reality of the latter's knowledge. In other words, a character's belief about something doesn't automatically make it true. So, ensure you distinguish between a character's belief about another's knowledge and the reality of that knowledge. Don't confuse this task with causal attribution. When providing your answer, enclose it in <answer> and </answer> brackets. Consider all these as you analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis to determine the nature of their logical relationship, placing them within the categories of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that 'entailment' refers to cases where the truth of the first statement unequivocally guarantees the truth of the second. On the other hand, a 'non-entailment' relationship exists when the truth of the first statement doesn't enforce the truth of the second statement. It's crucial to remember that the belief or assumption one character has about another's knowledge is not an automatic representation of reality. As such, delineate between a person's belief about another's knowledge and the actual state of that knowledge. Do not treat beliefs or assumptions as factual information when assessing the logical relation. In situations concerning ambiguity, such as unknown beliefs or suspicions, these should not be treated as truths. Make sure to not confuse this task with causal attribution. Encapsulate your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags for ease of evaluation. Foreground these considerations when assessing the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses.

In other words, a character's belief about something doesn't automatically make it true. So, ensure you distinguish between a character's belief about another's knowledge and the reality of that knowledge. Don't confuse this task with causal attribution.

   prompt: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis to determine the nature of their logical relationship, placing them within the categories of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that 'entailment' refers to cases where the truth of the first statement unequivocally guarantees the truth of the second. On the other hand, a 'non-entailment' relationship exists when the truth of the first statement doesn't enforce the truth of the second statement. It's crucial to remember that the belief or assumption one character has about another's knowledge is not an automatic representation of reality. As such, delineate between a person's belief about another's knowledge and the actual state of that knowledge. Do not treat beliefs or assumptions as factual information when assessing the logical relation. In situations concerning ambiguity, such as unknown beliefs or suspicions, these should not be treated as truths. Make sure to not confuse this task with causal attribution. Encapsulate your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags for ease of evaluation. Foreground these considerations when assessing the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The premise is your foundational statement, while the hypothesis is a derived supposition. In this context, 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the premise necessarily validates the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, 'non-entailment' arises when the truth of the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis's truth. Often, character assumptions about another character's belief will be presented. However, remember that an assumption about a belief is not confirmation of the belief itself. Ensure you critically analyze the information provided within the text rather than making unwarranted external assumptions. Note that this task is not about causation or attribution. When you have identified the relationship, please present your answer enclosed in <answer> and </answer> brackets, selecting between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Keep these guidance points in mind as you engage with the given premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Analyze the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses to determine whether there exists an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship. Remember, 'entailment' exists when if the first statement is undeniably true, then the second statement must also be irrefutably true. On the other hand, 'non-entailment' exists when if the first statement is true, the second statement does not necessarily have to be true. This logical connection differs from causal attribution.

   prompt: Determine the logical relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, which could either be an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. By definition, 'entailment' exists when if the first statement or premise is undeniably true, then the second statement or hypothesis must also be absolutely true. Alternatively, 'non-entailment' exists when if the first statement or premise is true, the second statement or hypothesis does not necessarily have to be true. Please note, this task evaluates the logical connections and is not about finding causal relationships. Moreover, when a premise describes a character's belief about another character's knowledge, it does not confirm the latter's understanding. In other words, even if a character believes that another character knows or understands something, this belief does not necessarily make it true. Thus, do not make assumptions beyond what is stated in the premises. Identify the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Once done, enclose your answer within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

   prompt: Assess the logical relationship between the statement (premise) and the conclusion (hypothesis). If the hypothesis is unquestionably true given the information from the premise alone, then choose 'entailment'. If the hypothesis is not inevitably true strictly using the premise, opt for 'non-entailment'. Crucially, a person's belief, perception, or assumption is NOT an evidence of the objective fact. Your answer must come in the format <answer> and </answer>. Consider these examples for clarity:

Example 1: If the premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book' and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', select 'non-entailment'. This illustrates the point that the assumption of an individual (John, in this case) doesn't guarantee Sara's possession of the book.

Example 2: If the premise states 'David sees that Peter gives a speech on stage' and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', select 'entailment'. This is because David's observation is a direct evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Please remember: if the premise is based solely on someone's perception, belief, or assumption, always select 'non-entailment'. If the premise gives directly observable and unquestionable evidence of the hypothesis, select 'entailment'.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Provide an answer indicating whether the hypothesis is completely proved by the premise. If it can be fully proved strictly based on the premise, choose 'entailment'. If the hypothesis cannot be definitively proved using only the premise, choose 'non-entailment'. Highlight the crucial difference: beliefs, assumptions, perceptions, and thoughts are not definitive proofs of reality and so do not provide objective evidence. Base your answer on undeniable, concrete evidence rather than personal beliefs or assumptions. Ensure your answer is enclosed between <answer> and </answer>. Observe these examples:

Example 1: For the premise 'John believes that Jessica has a cat', and the hypothesis is 'Jessica has a cat', the correct answer is 'non-entailment', since John's belief doesn't provide undeniable proof that Jessica owns a cat.

Example 2: For the premise 'The Metro news reported that a meteorite fell in the city center', and the hypothesis is 'A meteorite fell in the city center', the correct answer is 'entailment', given the fact that the Metro news report provides a form of objective evidence.

Even if a premise and a hypothesis match semantically or syntactically, it doesn't imply entailment unless it's based on undeniable evidence. Evaluate the premise along these lines and respond accordingly.
Identify the relation between the presented premise and hypotheses, and select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as your answer.

Now proceed with the premise: (... example here ...)

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. To choose 'entailment', the premise must provide concrete evidence that allows for the full proof of the hypothesis. Weaker forms of evidence, such as perceptions, beliefs, or assumptions do not offer solid proof and should lead to the selection of 'non-entailment'. It's crucial to remember that the perspective of an individual, including their perceived assumptions or beliefs, cannot constitute concrete evidence of objective reality. 

Provide your answer by choosing from the available options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Let's examine these examples to better understand: 

Example 1: Premise is 'John assumes that Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara has a book', you should select 'non-entailment', since an assumption does not provide concrete evidence of Sara having a book. 

Example 2: Premise is 'David observes Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gives a speech on stage', you should select 'entailment', because observation provides direct, concrete evidence of Peter giving a speech.

Example 3: Premise is 'Mandy said that she heard from her friend that John has a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John has a green car', you should select 'non-entailment' since hearsay does not provide solid proof of John's car color.

After identifying the relation between the following premise and hypothesis, choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', remember to provide a succinct justification for your selection.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis in a manner that only relies on concrete, universally applicable evidence - not perceptions, assumptions, or beliefs of an individual or a transfer of understanding from one individual to another. To choose 'entailment', the premise should provide irrefutable proof that directly leads to the hypothesis. If the premise only outlines subjective experiences, assumptions, or beliefs - even when transferred among individuals - or lacks compelling evidence, choose 'non-entailment'. 

Choose an answer from the given options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>, also provide a succinct justification for your selection. Consider these examples for better understanding:

Example 1: Premise is 'John concludes that Helen has a cat', and the hypothesis is 'Helen has a cat'. Despite John's conclusion, you should select 'non-entailment', as John's conclusion doesn't constitute concrete proof of Helen owning a cat.

Example 2: Premise is 'The security camera footage shows a man breaking into a store', and the hypothesis is 'A store was broken into'. You should select 'entailment', because the footage offers concrete evidence of the break-in event.

Example 3: Premise is 'Robert expresses to Sarah that he saw Tom moving into a new house', and the hypothesis is 'Sarah knows that Tom moved into a new house'. Here, you should select 'non-entailment', as Robert's information doesn't necessarily make it a known fact for Sarah.

Analyze the following premise and hypothesis, and choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Assess the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis using the concepts of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' should be selected if the premise offers indisputable, objective, and concrete evidence that proves the hypothesis in entirety. 'Non-entailment' should be selected when the premise yields incomplete, subjective, or nebulous evidence such as assumptions, beliefs, perceptions, or memories that do not solidly support the hypothesis. Remember, it is not the truthfulness of the premise or hypothesis that matters, but the procedural evidence from premise to hypothesis.

It's important to underline that the model cannot use its own knowledge or assumptions about the world; it can only use the information provided in the premise. Strictly focus on the proof linkage between the premise and hypothesis and pay close attention to who or what is the subject in each. Ensure to wrap your selected answer including its justification between <answer> and </answer>.

Consider the following examples for better contextual understanding:
Example 1: Suppose the premise is 'Steven remembers that John believes Sara has a book', and the hypothesis is 'John believes Sara has a book', select 'entailment' because Steven's memory directly proves that John does indeed believe Sara has a book. John's belief essentially becomes the factor to be proved here, not Sara's book ownership.

Example 2: If the premise is 'Alex tells that David saw Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter is giving a speech on stage', opt for 'non-entailment'. We only get to know that David saw Peter giving a speech based on Alex's statement, but this does not provide irrefutable proof of Peter actually giving a speech on stage.

Example 3: If the premise states 'Mandy believes that she heard from Bob that John owns a green car', and the hypothesis is 'Bob has stated that John owns a green car', select 'entailment'. Here, Mandy's belief gives solid proof that Bob has made such a statement. Note that the hypothesis is not about John's car color but about Bob's statement.

Once you comprehend the previous examples, examine the relationship between the following premise and hypothesis. Your answer should entail either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Also, remember to provide a succinct reasoning for your selection. 
Premise: Provide premise here
Hypothesis: Provide hypothesis here

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the provided premise and the corresponding hypothesis. For a choice of 'entailment', the premise must contain irrefutable evidence enabling the full affirmation of the hypothesis. Conversely, 'non-entailment' should be chosen in the absence of concrete evidence. Assumptions, beliefs, perceptions, suspicions, or hearsay can direct towards a possibility but do not corroborate the hypothesis as an objective fact. Remember, individual perspectives and inferred conjectures are not solid pieces of evidence for an objective truth.

After assessing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, select either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', providing a brief explanation of your choice in your answer. In your explanation, be sure to address whether there's any possible scenario where the hypothesis is not true given the premise. Choose your answer from the options bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Consider the following examples:

Example 1: If the premise is 'John suspects that Sara owns a book', and the hypothesis is 'Sara owns a book', you should choose 'non-entailment', because John's suspicions do not offer incontrovertible proof that Sara owns a book. 

Example 2: If the premise is 'Ben said he directly witnessed Peter giving a speech on stage', and the hypothesis is 'Peter gave a speech on stage', you should choose 'entailment', as Ben's direct witnessing provides unambiguous evidence of the event. 

Example 3: If the premise is 'Mandy mentioned that her friend thinks John owns a green car', and the hypothesis is 'John owns a green car', you should choose 'non-entailment', as a third party's belief doesn't constitute hard evidence. 

Exercise caution in cases where the premise and the hypothesis involve different subjects. A person's knowledge or belief does not necessarily mean the other individual is conscious of it in the same aspect.

Now, provided below are premise and hypothesis. Identify the relationship between them, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Evaluate the logical correlation between provided premises and hypotheses. Choose 'entailment' if the hypothesis would undoubtedly be true in any scenario based on the factual components of the premise. Opt for 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis can't be conclusively established as true from the premise, even under all plausible conditions. It is crucial to distinguish between subjective beliefs, assumptions, and perspectives of individuals and factual details in the premise. Do not treat beliefs or assumptions about someone as concrete information about that person. Avoid considering trivial details that do not contribute to the validity of the hypothesis, focusing instead on deductions based on hard facts. Even in "any conceivable scenario", remember to respect the line between one's perception and actual truth. Your choice should be presented in parentheses and formatted correctly, enclosed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Determine the relationship between given premises and hypotheses by distinguishing 'entailment' from 'non-entailment'. An 'entailment' is when there exists a scenario where the hypothesis can be proven true based on the premise. A 'non-entailment' is when the hypothesis does not necessarily hold true in any conceivable circumstance given the premise. When evaluating 'entailment', consider the beliefs, assumptions, and suspicions of each individual in the premise as independent and not necessarily factual. Apply the concept that a person's belief about someone else's belief may not necessarily confirm the truth of the latter's belief. Disregard any incidental details that do not contribute to the core understanding of the hypothesis. Your focus should be the primary inference one can draw from the premise. Clearly indicate your choice by putting it in parenthesis and enclose your response within <answer> and </answer>, adhering to the requested answer format.

   prompt: Determine the logical relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, choosing from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Choose 'entailment' if you can imagine a scenario where the hypothesis would invariably be true given the context of the premise. Select 'non-entailment' if the hypothesis isn't definitively true under all possible scenarios provided by the premise. Understand that thoughts, beliefs, and assumptions of different individuals in the premise can diverge and should be assessed independently. Pay close attention to the source of beliefs or assumptions, especially when multiple individuals are involved in the premise, as their belief systems are independent. While finding alignment, do not rely solely on matching details in the premise and the hypothesis, instead critically engage with the likelihood and reliability of the sources of these details. Please indicate your answer in parenthesis and present it in the correct answer format which is within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Identify the logical relationship between the premises and hypotheses, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember that 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the first statement necessitates the truth of the second. Contrastingly, 'non-entailment' occurs when the truth of the first statement does not obligate the truth of the second. Keep in mind that the beliefs or assumptions a character makes about another's knowledge do not inherently represent the reality of the latter's knowledge. In other words, a character's belief about something doesn't automatically make it true. So, ensure you distinguish between a character's belief about another's knowledge and the reality of that knowledge. Don't confuse this task with causal attribution. When providing your answer, enclose it in <answer> and </answer> brackets. Consider all these as you analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Analyze the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses to determine whether there exists an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship. Remember, 'entailment' exists when if the first statement is undeniably true, then the second statement must also be irrefutably true. On the other hand, 'non-entailment' exists when if the first statement is true, the second statement does not necessarily have to be true. This logical connection differs from causal attribution. Importantly, keep in mind that the belief of a character regarding another character's knowledge or belief doesn't necessarily uphold the truth of such knowledge or belief. When providing the answer, enclose it within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

   prompt: Your task is to evaluate the logical relationship between two given sentences: the 'premise' and the 'hypothesis'. If the truth of the premise absolutely ensures the truth of the hypothesis, choose 'entailment'. If the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis, choose 'non-entailment'. Remember, this task requires clear-cut logical cohesion, not simply suggestive or inferential connections between the two statements.

   prompt: Your task involves analyzing the logical connection between two statements - a premise and a hypothesis. You need to categorize this relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The term 'entailment' is used when the truth of the premise (the first statement) directly leads to the truth of the hypothesis (the second statement). On the other hand, 'non-entailment' is when the truth of the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. Note that any beliefs, assumptions, or perspectives of characters mentioned in the statements are irrelevant to the establishment of this logical relationship. Ignore the characters' perspectives and focus only on the logical association between the premise and hypothesis. When you have identified the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', provide your answer within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses, selecting from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The premise is your foundational statement, while the hypothesis is a derived supposition. In this context, 'entailment' occurs when the truth of the premise necessarily validates the truth of the hypothesis. On the other hand, 'non-entailment' arises when the truth of the premise does not guarantee the hypothesis's truth. Often, character assumptions about another character's belief will be presented. However, remember that an assumption about a belief is not confirmation of the belief itself. Ensure you critically analyze the information provided within the text rather than making unwarranted external assumptions. Note that this task is not about causation or attribution. When you have identified the relationship, please present your answer enclosed in <answer> and </answer> brackets, selecting between 'entailment' and 'non-entailment'. Keep these guidance points in mind as you engage with the given premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis to determine the nature of their logical relationship, placing them within the categories of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Note that 'entailment' refers to cases where the truth of the first statement unequivocally guarantees the truth of the second. On the other hand, a 'non-entailment' relationship exists when the truth of the first statement doesn't enforce the truth of the second statement. It's crucial to remember that the belief or assumption one character has about another's knowledge is not an automatic representation of reality. As such, delineate between a person's belief about another's knowledge and the actual state of that knowledge. Do not treat beliefs or assumptions as factual information when assessing the logical relation. In situations concerning ambiguity, such as unknown beliefs or suspicions, these should not be treated as truths. Make sure to not confuse this task with causal attribution. Encapsulate your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags for ease of evaluation. Foreground these considerations when assessing the logical relationship between premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Your task is to identify the logical relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 'Entailment' refers to the scenario where if the first statement (premise) is undeniably true, then the second statement (hypothesis) is also irrefutably true. Conversely, 'non-entailment' implies that if the first statement is true, the second statement does not have to be true. 

It is critical to differentiate this from causal attribution, as this task focuses on logic, not cause-effect relationships. It is important, particularly in situations where a character's belief about another's thought, belief, or knowledge is concerned, to remember that a belief about another person's knowledge does not necessarily confirm the truth of that knowledge. For instance, if Sophia believes Robert suspects something, it doesn't mean Robert actually suspects it.

Your judgment should be based on the logical relationship between the two statements, not the source or holder of the belief. Consequently, the fact that if David remembers something does not influence the validity of the memory itself. Similarly, one person’s belief about another person’s knowledge does not confirm the latter's knowledge as fact.

When you have decided whether the relationship is one of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', provide your answer enclosed within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

   prompt: Determine the logical relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, which could either be an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. By definition, 'entailment' exists when if the first statement or premise is undeniably true, then the second statement or hypothesis must also be absolutely true. Alternatively, 'non-entailment' exists when if the first statement or premise is true, the second statement or hypothesis does not necessarily have to be true. Please note, this task evaluates the logical connections and is not about finding causal relationships. Moreover, when a premise describes a character's belief about another character's knowledge, it does not confirm the latter's understanding. In other words, even if a character believes that another character knows or understands something, this belief does not necessarily make it true. Thus, do not make assumptions beyond what is stated in the premises. Identify the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Once done, enclose your answer within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

   prompt: Your task is to determine the type of logical relationship, 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', that exists between a given premise and a hypothesis. An 'entailment' relationship exists when the unassailable truth of the first statement necessitates the undeniable truth of the second. Conversely, a 'non-entailment' relationship exists when the truth of the first statement doesn't guarantee the truth of the second statement. Note that this isn't about causal attribution or about validating the truth of the characters' beliefs or perceptions. Be aware that when a character's belief or perception about another character is involved, it doesn't confirm the reality of the perceived knowledge or belief. Do not overcomplicate or over-analyze the logical relationship. If a premise and a hypothesis are identical, it typically signifies an 'entailment' relationship, unless otherwise stated by the context. Deliver your answer in the form of (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment, and enclose it within <answer> and </answer> for clarity.

   prompt: For this task, you will analyze the given premises and hypotheses' level of entailment based on logical coherence. Remember, it's crucial to accurately map entities i.e., characters, objects, and events mentioned in the premise and the hypothesis. Do not confuse 'direct information' with 'indirect information' or modifiers such as 'beliefs' or 'suspicions'. Be cautious about assuming synonymous terminologies to be identical – the context is key. Entailment is determined if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise, and all elements including entities, actions, and circumstances align in both.

Once you've made your consideration, select an option from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Afterwards, provide a brief justification for your chosen answer, explaining both the information and the logic which was used to reach this conclusion.

   prompt: Identify and analyse the following premises and hypotheses. Keep in mind the following key concepts while doing so:
1. Understand the difference between direct and indirect information. For example, 'beliefs', 'assumptions', and 'suspicions' indicate indirect information - Therefore, do not just assume them as factual.
2. Understand logical entailment. For instance, a less specific statement (hypothesis) can be logically derived from a more specific one (premise). Similarly, the use of modifiers in a statement should not hinder your judgement.
3. Treat each task independently and use deduction over prediction.

After comprehension, determine if the hypothesis can be logically derived from the premise. Make a choice from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, entailment doesn't necessarily mean a verbatim repetition of statements. Analyse and try to identify implied concepts that could be logically connected.

Encapsulate your answer and justification in the format: 
<answer> (Your choice of A or B) Justification: (Your explanation here) </answer>

Now have a look at these premises and hypotheses and identify the level of entailment between them. Be sure to choose from the options of 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
