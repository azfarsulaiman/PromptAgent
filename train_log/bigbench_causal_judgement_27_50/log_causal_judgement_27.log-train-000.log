How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this example, the model's error is due to misunderstanding the concept of cause. Even though Alice was the second to log in, her action did not cause the mistake because the problematic event (an empty email sent) would have happened even if she hadn't logged in. Zoe has already logged in and caused the email to be sent. In other words, Alice's action didn't change the outcome. This suggests that the prompt is not explicit enough in guiding the model to discern causation in complex scenarios.

<2> This example again shows the model having trouble understanding nuanced causation. Louie had already won the bet by scoring the 3-point shot at the beginning of the game, so his later layup wasn't the reason he won the bet. The model fails to properly distinguish between the sequence of events and the causal events. It attributes the causation to the final event instead of the actual causal event.

<3> Here, the model makes a mistake in causation due to a misunderstanding of intention. Jake meant to shoot his aunt, but did not aim to shoot her in the heart specifically. The question requires the model to differentiate between the intent to cause harm and the specific outcome of that intention. Once again, this suggests a lack of precision in dealing with complicated concepts in the current prompt.

<4> This example is slightly tricky as the question asks for an association between the device being fully charged and Wayne's inaction to move it. The current prompt didn’t guide the model to give enough weight to certain passive actions as potential causes. The model incorrectly assumed that Wayne's non-action didn't contribute to the event, leading to the wrong answer.

Based on these insights, it seems the current prompt struggles with questions concerning complex causation, sequence of events, intentionality, and passive actions. To improve, the prompt could:

1. Specify that the model should take into account the logical sequence of events to discern the true cause rather than assuming a linear causation.
2. Be explicit in guiding the model to consider the intent and specific outcomes, and to differentiate between them when they are incongruent.
3. Emphasize that both active and passive actions might contribute to an event, and guide the model to consider inaction as a potential cause.
4. Ask the model to evaluate alternative scenarios and think counterfactually ("What would have happened if...?") when appraising causation.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

gradient:
<1> 
Examining the question: The question asks whether the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun. The confusion arises from the use of the word 'intentionally'. While the sniper knows the barrel would heat up as a consequence of his action, the heating of the barrel is not the desired outcome but a by-product. 

Examining the model's response: The model answered (B) No, likely because it understood that the sniper didn't purposely want to heat the barrel. It's not an incorrect intuition for the model since the sniper didn't care about whether or not the barrel heats up. Hence, from a strict point of view, one could argue that the reaction wasn't 'intentional'.

Why the prompt leads to a wrong answer: The prompt doesn't clarify what interpretation the model should take when considering intentionality in causal attribution. The model might have interpreted 'intentionally' as 'purposefully for an intended outcome', which in this context led to a wrong answer.

Improvement:
- The prompt could be more specific about how to consider consequences that are known to the actor but are not the intended outcome. For example, the prompt could specify that if the actor is aware that a certain action will lead to a certain outcome, regardless of whether he cares about that outcome, his action is considered as intentional towards that outcome.
- The prompt could also clarify whether the task requires a strict or a broad interpretation of 'intentionality' and 'cause'.
- The prompt could provide a guideline on how to handle ethical and moral implications when evaluating intentionality and causality. In this case, the ethical question of the sniper's responsibility for all consequences of his action, intended or not, could play a role.
- The prompt could also instruct the model to consider common sense or popular opinion when there's ambiguity in interpreting the question.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed.

gradient:
<1> 
The question is about whether the pharmacist's decision to sign off caused the patient's recovery. The pharmacist's signing off, from the given context, was merely a procedural task of indicating that the drug was in stock. The causality of the recovery is attributed to both the intern deciding to use the drug and the attending doctor's approval, knowing the risk involved. The model's response is incorrect because it misinterpreted the pharmacist's role in the patient's recovery.

The first prompt might have been misleading due to its generic nature. The generic nature of the prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" might not provide the necessary specificity to accurately attribute causality in each context.

<2> 
In this question, David's clothes dry in 60 minutes due to the fact that it's set to MAX DRY. Although David changes the temperature to HIGH, it doesn't affect the drying time, since the clothes dry within 60 minutes even if only the cycle is set to MAX DRY. The model might have misinterpreted causality due to the actions taken by David, overlooking the fact that the cycle being set to MAX DRY was sufficient for the clothes to dry in 60 minutes.

Again, the prompt might not be specific enough for the model to correctly attribute causality.

<3> 
In the third question, the breaker fails because three people turn on their lamps at the same time. Even though it's not Jim's electricity day, his turning on the lamp alongside Carol and Bob caused the failure. Yet, the model incorrectly states that Jim turning on his lamp did not cause the breaker to fail.

The prompt in this case might have led the model to attribute causality incorrectly by oversimplifying the multiple causal factors involved (i.e., the number of people turning off their lamps at the same time) down to one single cause (i.e., Jim's misuse of his lamp).

Improvements could be made in the following aspects:
1. Specify the type and complexity of the causation in the prompt. For instance, simple and clear prompts might be suitable for simple causations, while intricate situations might benefit from a more complex way of questioning.
2. Ask the model to consider all potential causal factors and recognize that there might be multiple causes leading to an effect.
3. Encourage the model to pay more attention to the details given in the context rather than just focusing on the actions of individuals.

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No <(B)>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
The question is about whether the pharmacist's decision to sign off caused the patient's recovery. The pharmacist's signing off, from the given context, was merely a procedural task of indicating that the drug was in stock. The causality of the recovery is attributed to both the intern deciding to use the drug and the attending doctor's approval, knowing the risk involved. The model's response is incorrect because it misinterpreted the pharmacist's role in the patient's recovery.

The first prompt might have been misleading due to its generic nature. The generic nature of the prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" might not provide the necessary specificity to accurately attribute causality in each context.

<2> 
In this question, David's clothes dry in 60 minutes due to the fact that it's set to MAX DRY. Although David changes the temperature to HIGH, it doesn't affect the drying time, since the clothes dry within 60 minutes even if only the cycle is set to MAX DRY. The model might have misinterpreted causality due to the actions taken by David, overlooking the fact that the cycle being set to MAX DRY was sufficient for the clothes to dry in 60 minutes.

Again, the prompt might not be specific enough for the model to correctly attribute causality.

<3> 
In the third question, the breaker fails because three people turn on their lamps at the same time. Even though it's not Jim's electricity day, his turning on the lamp alongside Carol and Bob caused the failure. Yet, the model incorrectly states that Jim turning on his lamp did not cause the breaker to fail.

The prompt in this case might have led the model to attribute causality incorrectly by oversimplifying the multiple causal factors involved (i.e., the number of people turning off their lamps at the same time) down to one single cause (i.e., Jim's misuse of his lamp).

Improvements could be made in the following aspects:
1. Specify the type and complexity of the causation in the prompt. For instance, simple and clear prompts might be suitable for simple causations, while intricate situations might benefit from a more complex way of questioning.
2. Ask the model to consider all potential causal factors and recognize that there might be multiple causes leading to an effect.
3. Encourage the model to pay more attention to the details given in the context rather than just focusing on the actions of individuals.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example Analysis:

This example requires a nuanced understanding of intentionality. The language model seemingly has chosen option A because Bob knowingly proceeds with the plan that causes harm to the townspeople. However, his main intention was to steal as much money as possible, not to harm the townspeople - their harm was a byproduct of his action, not his primary goal. This indicates that the language model is unable to correctly interpret the motives driving characters' actions.

The factors possibly contributing to the wrong answer include:

1. Failure to comprehend complex meaning: The language model fails to accurately comprehend nuanced meanings and intentions in the given scenario, leading to a misjudgement of Bob's action as intentionally harmful.

2. Simplification of cause and effect: The language model likely simplifies the cause-effect relationship, leading it to interpret the scenario from a direct cause-effect perspective. If Bob's action resulted in harm, it presumes that the harm was intended. 

3. Difficulty with human intent: Determining intent, especially in complex scenarios, requires deep, nuanced understanding, something a language model could have difficulty with.

Possible improvements:

1. Modify the prompt to explicitly request an examination of the characters' INTENDED outcomes.

2. Incorporate a request for the language model to identify the main motive of the characters in complex scenarios.

3. Ask the model to distinguish between directly intended consequences and side effects of an action.

After these analyses and suggested improvements, the prompt could look like this:

"Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Discuss the primary intentions driving each character's actions and distinguish between effects that were directly intended and side effects that were not the goal of the action. Interpret causality accurately in cases of multiple contributing factors and complex intentions."

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

gradient:
<1> 

Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Wrong Answer: A
Correct Answer: B

Reason for Incorrectness: The model appears to have misinterpreted the causality of the event. The question specifies that both wires (black and red) need to touch the battery for it to short-circuit. It might have been caused by the general tendency of the model to look for direct cause-effect relationships, hence choosing the black wire which is designated to touch the battery. However, in this scenario, both wires touching the battery are simultaneously required to cause a short circuit.

<2>

Question: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Wrong Answer: B
Correct Answer: A

Reason for Incorrectness: The model seems to have interpreted the question incorrectly. From the question, it's clear that Louis winning the bet could be due to either making a layup or a 3-point shot. While the model acknowledges that making the layup was a contributing factor, it incorrectly assumes that the 3-point shot at the buzzer was the main causal factor.

<3>

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Wrong Answer: B
Correct Answer: A

Reason for Incorrectness: The model gets the answer wrong because it fundamentally misreads the dependencies in the causation chain. The prompt instructions have led it to overcomplicate the causation interpretation. The model likely chose 'No' because the spinning action alone (without the dice roll) would not cause Alex to win. However, since the spinning event resulted in the spin landing on green, and this occurring in conjunction with the dice roll triggers a victory, it was a contributing factor.

Prompt Improvement Based on the above analysis: 

1. Clarify that the model should understand the entire clause of causation, not just the individual elements in isolation from each other.

2. The model should place more emphasis on the conditions given in the causality chain. It needs to examine condition-dependent causality carefully.

3. The prompt can stress on identification of all contributing factors, not only the final or the most immediate event leading to the outcome.

4. The prompt could ask the model to consider whether the outcome would have been the same if one of the events had not occurred. This might aid in making accurate determinations in convoluted causation scenarios like these.

5. A clarification can be added to ensure the model recognizes requirements for simultaneous or multiple conditions to consider causation.

Improved Prompt: 

Analyze the given scenarios and discern the critical elements necessary for the outcomes to occur. Understand the full context of causation and contribution of all factors involved, even in cases of multiple contributing factors or conditional events. Reflect on the influences of all components of the scenario and accurately determine if they are directly leading to the result or if they are merely a part of a larger, more complex causation chain. Remember that the event immediately preceding the outcome is not always the primary or only cause.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 

Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Wrong Answer: A
Correct Answer: B

Reason for Incorrectness: The model appears to have misinterpreted the causality of the event. The question specifies that both wires (black and red) need to touch the battery for it to short-circuit. It might have been caused by the general tendency of the model to look for direct cause-effect relationships, hence choosing the black wire which is designated to touch the battery. However, in this scenario, both wires touching the battery are simultaneously required to cause a short circuit.

<2>

Question: Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Wrong Answer: B
Correct Answer: A

Reason for Incorrectness: The model seems to have interpreted the question incorrectly. From the question, it's clear that Louis winning the bet could be due to either making a layup or a 3-point shot. While the model acknowledges that making the layup was a contributing factor, it incorrectly assumes that the 3-point shot at the buzzer was the main causal factor.

<3>

Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Wrong Answer: B
Correct Answer: A

Reason for Incorrectness: The model gets the answer wrong because it fundamentally misreads the dependencies in the causation chain. The prompt instructions have led it to overcomplicate the causation interpretation. The model likely chose 'No' because the spinning action alone (without the dice roll) would not cause Alex to win. However, since the spinning event resulted in the spin landing on green, and this occurring in conjunction with the dice roll triggers a victory, it was a contributing factor.

Prompt Improvement Based on the above analysis: 

1. Clarify that the model should understand the entire clause of causation, not just the individual elements in isolation from each other.

2. The model should place more emphasis on the conditions given in the causality chain. It needs to examine condition-dependent causality carefully.

3. The prompt can stress on identification of all contributing factors, not only the final or the most immediate event leading to the outcome.

4. The prompt could ask the model to consider whether the outcome would have been the same if one of the events had not occurred. This might aid in making accurate determinations in convoluted causation scenarios like these.

5. A clarification can be added to ensure the model recognizes requirements for simultaneous or multiple conditions to consider causation.

Improved Prompt: 

Analyze the given scenarios and discern the critical elements necessary for the outcomes to occur. Understand the full context of causation and contribution of all factors involved, even in cases of multiple contributing factors or conditional events. Reflect on the influences of all components of the scenario and accurately determine if they are directly leading to the result or if they are merely a part of a larger, more complex causation chain. Remember that the event immediately preceding the outcome is not always the primary or only cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, John's job in the plastics division exposed him to asbestos, a known carcinogen, which likely contributed to his development of lung cancer. Additionally, the accidental administration of the wrong medication by the new nurse led to John's immediate death. Both factors played a role in John's premature death.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question: Did John's job cause his premature death?
Model's Response: In this scenario, John's job in the plastics division exposed him to asbestos, a known carcinogen, which likely contributed to his development of lung cancer. Additionally, the accidental administration of the wrong medication by the new nurse led to John's immediate death. Both factors played a role in John's premature death.
Correct Label: No
Model's Prediction: Yes

Analysis: The model seems to conflate contributing factors with being the direct, immediate cause of a situation. While it is true that John's exposure to asbestos at his job contributed to his health condition, the immediate cause of his death was the wrong medication and subsequent allergic reaction. Hence, the model's focus on the job's contribution to his lung cancer is out of context when the question is asking for the cause of his death.

Reasons for Error: 
1) The prompt asks the model to consider all potential causes, which may lead the model to try to incorporate all mentioned factors into the final judgment, instead of isolating the main cause. 
2) The model might be misunderstanding the term "cause" in the context of the question, where it specifically refers to the immediate cause of death, not the entire life circumstance that led to his poor health.

Improvements:
1) Specify clearly in the prompt that the model needs to distinguish direct and immediate causes from contributing or long-term factors. 
2) Ask the model to consider the specific context of each question when making a judgment. 
3) The prompt could guide the model to focus on the specific causal chain leading directly to the event in question, instead of general causality in a broader context. 
4) Refine the prompt to enforce a better understanding of the temporal sequence of events, with an emphasis on immediate causes in scenarios where it applies. 
5) The prompt could instruct the model to consider the phrasing and specific request of the question to determine what type of cause is being asked for.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's actions of rolling the dice and spinning the spinner simultaneously did not directly cause him to win the game. The outcome of winning the game was determined by the rules of the game, which stated that he would win if the total of the dice roll was greater than 2 or if the spinner landed on green. Alex's actions were simply following the rules of the game, and the outcome was a result of those rules rather than his specific actions.

Therefore, the answer is: <B>No</B>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
For this specific example, the model misunderstood the concept of causation. The prompt asked the model to examine the character’s actions and predict the result based on causality. In this scenario, although the game's rules and luck influenced the outcome, the model should have recognized that Alex's action (spinning the spinner) was directly responsible for winning the game, as it satisfies one of the game's winning conditions. Thus, in this context, Alex's action of spinning caused him to win. 

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:

1. Complexity of Interpretation: The model might have found the scenario complex due to the dual conditions for winning the game, which are rolling a number higher than 2 and the spinner landing on green. 

2. Misunderstanding of Direct Action and Intent: The model didn't perceive that Alex's act of spinning the spinner, despite being influenced by chance, was a direct action contributing to the resultant win.

3. Overemphasis on Rules: The model overly focused on the pre-set game rules, leading it to consider the dice and the spinner's outcomes as independent entities, not considering Alex's actions to be causal factors in the game outcome.

For improving the prompt, consider these aspects:

1. Simplify the Language: Make the language simpler and more directive, focusing on the direct effects of the characters' actions.

2. Provide More Guidelines: Provide more guidance on how direct actions, even if they involve factors of randomness or luck, can be causal in nature.

3. Balance the Focus: Instead of solely interpreting the intention behind actions, the model should allocate substantial focus to the actions themselves and their immediate repercussions.

So the revised prompt would be:

"Evaluate the scenarios and identify the direct consequences of the characters' actions. Differentiate between results that are explicitly intended and those which are unintended or incidental. Carefully consider all factors, including potential elements of randomness or chance. Determine the primary motives driving each character's actions, and explore potential complexities in relation to cause and effect. Ensure accurate interpretations are made, even when the situation involves various contributing factors."

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

The main cause of Louie winning the bet was his successful 3-point shot right at the buzzer. While making the layup at the start of the game was an action conducted with direct intent, it did not directly lead to him winning the bet. Louie's primary motive was to win the $100, which he achieved by making the 3-point shot. 

Therefore, the answer is: <B>No</B>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

Question - "Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?"

Model's Response - The model asserted that the main cause of Louie winning the bet was his successful 3-point shot right at the buzzer and hence answered 'No'.

Reason for Wrong Answer - The prompt is asking the model to distinguish between actions with "direct intent" and actions with "unintended side effects", however in this context, this distinction led to confusion, as both actions were intentional and contributed to the outcome. The model over focused on the final shot as the 'direct cause' which led it to dismiss the importance of the layup. However, according to the terms of the bet, Louie would win if he made either a layup or a 3-point shot, which means both actions were contributing factors to Louie winning the bet. 

2) Improvement Suggestions:

i) Context Interpretation - The prompt should guide the model to ensure it has accurately interpreted the conditions set in the context. In this case, it's the terms of the bet: a layup or a 3-point shot would allow Louie to win.

ii) Importance of All Actions - The prompt should emphasize analyzing the consequence of each individual action as well as their combined effects. This would have made the model understand the individual significance of the layup and the 3-point shot.

iii) More Explicit Logic Analysis - The prompt should clearly ask the model to perform a more explicit logical analysis of the conditions in the scenario, which could have highlighted the fact that the 'or' condition in the bet means both actions were contributing factors.

iv) Balanced Intent Analysis - Encourage the model to take a balanced approach while analyzing intent. In this case, it should not overweigh the last action just because it was the most recent. Both actions were intentional and directly led to the outcome.

Based on these, the improved prompt could be:

"In the provided scenarios, carefully analyze the actions of the characters and the conditions imposed in the scenario. Evaluate how each action contributes to the result and discern the outcomes of both individual actions and their cumulative effect. Identify actions conducted with direct intent and their precise impact on the result. Apply explicit logical analysis to conditions and outcomes, and ensure an objective evaluation even when multiple influencing factors are present."

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

(A) Yes

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning <1>:

In this scenario, the language model erred because it does not seem to fully grasp the difference between causality and responsibility. The model confuses Alice's action (logging in at the rightful time) with Zoe's (logging in early), overlooking the contextual aspect of company policy which Zoe violated. 

- The model does not seem to understand the scenario in a linear, chronological order, i.e., the fact that Zoe's early login was the first and primary cause. If Zoe hadn't logged in early, the email error would not have happened, regardless of Alice's subsequent login.

- The language model may have misunderstood the implications of policy in this scenario, especially its importance in determining who is responsible for a particular action. The phrase "violating the official policy" doesn't stand out as a pivotal element in the prompt to adequately influence the model's response.

- The model may have failed to correctly distinguish between a direct action (Alice logging in at 9.30 am) and an indirect action with unintended side effects (Zoe's logging in at 9 am leading to an empty email being sent).

Improvements for the Prompt:

Based on these reasons, several aspects can be improved in the input prompt:

1. Include explicit directive to consider sequence of events in understanding causality.

2. Emphasize the role and importance of rules, policies, or norms in determining accountability or responsibility for an event or action.

3. Request a distinction between the responsibility stemming from policy violation and the cause-effect relationship.

4. Ask specifically for actions leading to direct outcomes versus those leading to unintended side effects.

5. Require parsing of more complex sentences to extract the essence of causality, emphasizing on the underlying policy violation rather than the immediate trigger. 

6. Encourage thorough examination and insight into context, understanding the dynamic between different players' actions contributing to an event.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

(A) Yes
(B) No

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong example 1: 
The prompt fails in this scenario as it misinterprets the intentions of Bob, the henchman. Even though Bob does indeed say that he doesn't care for the health of the townspeople, he doesn't actively intend to harm their health. Instead, he just wants to pursue his goal of robbing the bank. The prompt should encourage the model to consider the role of direct intention vs. consequenced indifference in pursuing a given objective. The analaysis should have taken into account the importance of Bob saying "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople", rather than "I aim to harm the townspeople's health". The indifference towards the health issue is secondary to his main intention. As such, his primary intention of stealing money doesn't directly equate to an intention to harm the townspeople's health.

2) Wrong example 2: 
The model fails to correctly interpret the prompt in this case as well. Here, the sniper's intention to heat the barrel falls under a foreseen but not desired consequence. Although heating the barrel is a direct result of pulling the trigger, the model needs to understand that it doesn't translate to an "intention" to do so. The primary intention in this case, again, is to kill the enemy commander. The heat of the barrel is an inevitable consequence of firing the weapon, not a premeditated action.

Improvement and conclusion to the prompt can be done based on these reasons:

- The importance of direct intention vs. indirect consequences or foreseen but unintended outcomes needs to be underlined in the prompt.
- The model needs to recognize the distinctions between primary objectives and secondary consequences which might be 'allowed' but not 'desired'.
- The prompt should direct the model to differentiate better between active planning and passive acceptance of outcomes.
- Lastly, the model should be guided to better recognize the hierarchical order of the events or intentions involved. This can help it comprehend which actions are directly 'caused' by a character and which ones are simply 'effects' that follow the primary action.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. <A>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The primary intention was to kill the enemy commander, and the heating of the barrel was merely an incidental consequence of pulling the trigger. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1) Wrong example 1: 
The prompt fails in this scenario as it misinterprets the intentions of Bob, the henchman. Even though Bob does indeed say that he doesn't care for the health of the townspeople, he doesn't actively intend to harm their health. Instead, he just wants to pursue his goal of robbing the bank. The prompt should encourage the model to consider the role of direct intention vs. consequenced indifference in pursuing a given objective. The analaysis should have taken into account the importance of Bob saying "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople", rather than "I aim to harm the townspeople's health". The indifference towards the health issue is secondary to his main intention. As such, his primary intention of stealing money doesn't directly equate to an intention to harm the townspeople's health.

2) Wrong example 2: 
The model fails to correctly interpret the prompt in this case as well. Here, the sniper's intention to heat the barrel falls under a foreseen but not desired consequence. Although heating the barrel is a direct result of pulling the trigger, the model needs to understand that it doesn't translate to an "intention" to do so. The primary intention in this case, again, is to kill the enemy commander. The heat of the barrel is an inevitable consequence of firing the weapon, not a premeditated action.

Improvement and conclusion to the prompt can be done based on these reasons:

- The importance of direct intention vs. indirect consequences or foreseen but unintended outcomes needs to be underlined in the prompt.
- The model needs to recognize the distinctions between primary objectives and secondary consequences which might be 'allowed' but not 'desired'.
- The prompt should direct the model to differentiate better between active planning and passive acceptance of outcomes.
- Lastly, the model should be guided to better recognize the hierarchical order of the events or intentions involved. This can help it comprehend which actions are directly 'caused' by a character and which ones are simply 'effects' that follow the primary action.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision did not directly cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug being administered, which was made possible by both the pharmacist and the attending doctor signing off on it. The attending doctor's decision to go against the hospital policy and sign off on the drug did play a role in the outcome, but it was not the sole cause of the patient's recovery.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Question Analysis: The question asks if the attending doctor's decision caused the patient's recovery. Though it's clear that his approval permitted the drug administration, its direct causation relationship with the patient's recovery is a point of contention.

Model's Wrong Answer Analysis: The model said that the attending doctor's decision is not the sole cause for patient recovery. The model is focusing on singular primary causes, dismissing equally important contributing factors. The doctor's approval, though might not be the direct cause, it has initiated the chain of events leading to the patient's recovery. Thus the model's interpretation skewed from multiple causation relationships. 

Additional Incorrect Reasoning: Multiple signatures were required for the drug administration and, the model seems to have misunderstood simultaneous signatures equate simultaneous causes which makes none of them more relevant than the other. This view is incorrect since certain actions can have major significance based on their impacts and not their order. 

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt: 
1. Clearly define cause: Specify that multiple actions, decisions, or events can jointly contribute to the outcome. A cause can be any event that contributes significantly to the outcome, direct or indirect.

2. Contextual Importance: The prompt should emphasise the importance of hierarchical and contextual significance in events leading to an outcome. It must stress evaluating actions not just in sequence but in terms of their consequence and the ability to alter the outcome.

3. Multiple-causation: Make it explicit for the AI to consider multiple-cause scenarios and not to focus on finding a single primary cause. 

4. Correlation vs Causation: Elaborate on differentiating between actual causes and mere correlations or sequence of events. A correlation (even a strong one) does not necessarily mean causation.

5. 'What if' Scenarios: To determine the significance of each event, consider 'what if' scenarios where one or more of the events are altered or deleted. Ask if each decision or event has the power to change the outcome. This can better clarify how much each event contributes to the outcome.

The attending doctor's decision to sign off, despite the hospital policy, was a contributing factor in the administration of the drug, but it was not the direct cause of the patient's recovery.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: "Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?"
Model's Response: "The attending doctor's decision did not cause the patient's recovery... The attending doctor's decision to sign off... was a contributing factor... but it was not the direct cause... "

Reason for Wrong Answer: The language model seems to have misinterpreted the question. The question is very clearly asking whether the doctor's decision (i.e. to sign off on the administration of the medicine) caused the patient's recovery. Yet, although the model responds that the doctor's decision was a contributing factor, it concludes by emphasizing that it was not the ‘direct’ cause, which is not the essence of the question. The word 'direct' might not have been clarified in the input prompt, causing confusion. 

Wrong Example 2:

Question: "Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?"
Model's Response: "Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople."

Reason for Wrong Answer: The scenario runs that Bob's intention was primarily to steal as much money as possible, regardless of the incidental harm to the townspeople. While his actions inevitably led to the harm of the townspeople, it wasn't intentional in terms of his ultimate objective. The model appears to have missed this nuance, and answering the question with ‘intent’ inseparably tied to the result or the outcome, which is not entirely correct.

Aspects to improve in the prompt:
1. Clarify Explanation of 'Cause': The prompt should be clearer about what constitutes a 'cause'. The focus should be on whether a specific action (or decision) led to a certain outcome, rather than whether it was the 'direct' cause.

2. Introduce Concept of 'Primary Intention': While discussing causality, the prompt should emphasize that what matters is not just the final outcome of a series of actions, but the initial motive or intention behind those actions.

3. Encourage Deeper Analysis: While the prompt talks about taking into account simultaneous or multiple conditions, it might help to stress that the model needs to scrutinize all aspects of a scenario—especially the motives, intents and end goals of the actors involved—in order to clearly differentiate between outcomes that happen as a side effect and those that are intentionally brought about. 

4. Nuance Understanding of Outcome: In situations where an action results in multiple outcomes, the prompt should instruct the model to consider which outcomes were intentional, primary goals and which ones were incidental or secondary.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?

gradient:
Wrong example 1:

Issue 1: The problem with the prompt's guidelines is that they left the model with an ambiguous definition of causality. In particular, Alice didn't cause the email to be sent as she was following the policy. If the policy were accurately adhered to, this situation wouldn't have occurred. The model wrongly attributed the outcome to the last person who logged in rather than the initial policy violation.

Issue 2: The model did not take into account the context of the rules established by the company. The actual policy was violated not by Alice, but by Zoe, which the model failed to properly evaluate. The model needs to be able to deduce that it was Zoe’s violation of the rules and not Alice’s action that caused the email to be sent.

Issue 3: The prompt lacks attention to the hierarchy of events, Alice logging into the computer followed the curricular policy and happened after Zoe's logging.

Wrong example 2:

Issue 1: The model did not adequately consider the description of the system, which emphasized that both wires had to touch for a short circuit to occur. Thus, the model incorrectly attributed the cause to the black wire alone.

Issue 2: The prompt instructs the model to consider whether the final outcome would be the same if any of the conditions were not present. In this instance, it's clear that the system wouldn't short circuit if either wire didn't touch the battery. However, the model didn't properly apply this consideration.

Issue 3: The model seems to be focusing on the intended actions and not the actuality of the situation. Even though the black wire was supposed to touch the battery, when it does in combination with the red wire, it still contributes to the problem.

Prompt improvement suggestions:

1. The prompt should emphasize the consideration of policy or rule violations while determining causality. 

2. The model should give more emphasis to the actions which violated the norm or procedure, not necessarily the final act before the outcome.

3. The prompt should stress the importance of considering whether any action alone can cause the outcome or multiple actions are needed simultaneously. 

4. The prompt should also stress the order of events and their role in interpreting causality, particularly when rules or protocols are involved.

When analyzing the presented scenarios, focus on deciphering the crucial elements leading to the outcomes. Endeavor to understand the complete context of the associated causal factors, bearing in mind that the conditions may sometimes occur simultaneously or multiply, which could drive the outcome. Every event holds significance, whether it is immediate or final in relation to the outcome, requires consideration. In interpreting causality, distinguish between actual planned causes and incidental consequences or mere sequences of events. Evaluate whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't occur, assisting in accurate determination of the contributing factors. Bear in mind that not every outcome is solely or directly caused by the event preceding it. In numerous instances, outcomes may be the result of multiple correlated factors. During your analysis, pay close attention to identifying the clear intentions and desired outcomes of the characters, differentiating them from tolerated or unforeseen consequences. Focus on understanding which outcomes were actively sought after versus those that were inevitable or passive results of the primary action. Always consider the hierarchical order of the events or intentions, which should guide you to understand which actions were purposefully caused and which ones were merely subsequent effects.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, the fact that the black wire touched the battery caused the machine to short circuit. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong example 1:

Issue 1: The problem with the prompt's guidelines is that they left the model with an ambiguous definition of causality. In particular, Alice didn't cause the email to be sent as she was following the policy. If the policy were accurately adhered to, this situation wouldn't have occurred. The model wrongly attributed the outcome to the last person who logged in rather than the initial policy violation.

Issue 2: The model did not take into account the context of the rules established by the company. The actual policy was violated not by Alice, but by Zoe, which the model failed to properly evaluate. The model needs to be able to deduce that it was Zoe’s violation of the rules and not Alice’s action that caused the email to be sent.

Issue 3: The prompt lacks attention to the hierarchy of events, Alice logging into the computer followed the curricular policy and happened after Zoe's logging.

Wrong example 2:

Issue 1: The model did not adequately consider the description of the system, which emphasized that both wires had to touch for a short circuit to occur. Thus, the model incorrectly attributed the cause to the black wire alone.

Issue 2: The prompt instructs the model to consider whether the final outcome would be the same if any of the conditions were not present. In this instance, it's clear that the system wouldn't short circuit if either wire didn't touch the battery. However, the model didn't properly apply this consideration.

Issue 3: The model seems to be focusing on the intended actions and not the actuality of the situation. Even though the black wire was supposed to touch the battery, when it does in combination with the red wire, it still contributes to the problem.

Prompt improvement suggestions:

1. The prompt should emphasize the consideration of policy or rule violations while determining causality. 

2. The model should give more emphasis to the actions which violated the norm or procedure, not necessarily the final act before the outcome.

3. The prompt should stress the importance of considering whether any action alone can cause the outcome or multiple actions are needed simultaneously. 

4. The prompt should also stress the order of events and their role in interpreting causality, particularly when rules or protocols are involved.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.
(3) When analyzing the presented scenarios, focus on deciphering the crucial elements leading to the outcomes. Endeavor to understand the complete context of the associated causal factors, bearing in mind that the conditions may sometimes occur simultaneously or multiply, which could drive the outcome. Every event holds significance, whether it is immediate or final in relation to the outcome, requires consideration.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The typical person would likely answer: (B) No
<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Question: "Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?"
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Correct Label: (A) Yes
Model's Prediction: (B) No

Reason for Incorrect Answer: The language model seems to misunderstand the concept of incidental consequences in causality. While the sniper’s primary intention was to neutralize the enemy commander and he didn't care about the heating of the gun barrel, relevance is placed on causality here. The articulation of the sniper's action "pulls the trigger" is the direct cause for both the death of the commander and the heating of the gun barrel. Regardless of the sniper's indifference towards the barrel getting hot, his action (i.e., pulling the trigger) inevitably leads to the said outcome, thus making this action causative and therefore intentional.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt: 

1. More Clarity on Causality: The prompt should have a greater focus on the principle that actions are considered intentional when they inevitably lead to the associated outcome, irrespective of whether the outcome was desired or cared for. 

2. Defining Intention: The term ‘intention’ used in the prompt needs clearer context. It is essential to differentiate between the 'intention' behind an action and the 'intention' towards an undesired but inevitable outcome of that action. 

3. Understanding Incidental Outcomes: The prompt needs to clarify that an incidental or unintentional outcome doesn’t imply a lack of causation. 

4. Emphasizing Consequential Actions: The prompt could also highlight those actions that have multiple outcomes are still intentional regarding all their inevitable consequences.

5. Illustrations and Examples: Including examples that effectively illustrate the conceptual understanding of causality and intentionality can significantly improve the prompt.

6. Clarifying Event Sequences: It should be more explicit that events may have sequences and that each sequence could lead to a different outcome. All outcomes, direct or indirect, are a result of the initiator action. 

By improving these aspects, the language model will be better prepared to analyze and understand scenarios where causation and intention might be complex or where undesired but inevitable outcomes are involved.

The key is to understand the comprehensive narrative of the causal factors involved, keeping in mind that events might be concurrent, multiply their effects, or form a chain that drives to the outcome. Give weight to all events, whether their impact is immediate or ultimate to the result—they all warrant consideration. Understand that interpreting causality isn't just about identifying actual planned causes; discern incidental consequences that may have occurred as a result of an action regardless of the actor's intention towards the secondary outcome. Evaluate the importance of each event by considering if the final outcome would remain unaltered if any of these events were removed or didn't occur, as this will aid in accurately identifying those factors instrumental in shaping the outcome. While acknowledging that a specific outcome isn't always dependent on the event that directly precedes it, always consider the complexity of interplay among multiple factors that may lead to the given outcome. Analyzing the actions of the individuals or groups involved is also essential—pay heed to their intentions, desired outcomes, and the consequences that they either tolerated, aimed for, or simply didn't anticipate. Probe into which outcomes were actively sought after, which were simply tolerated, and which were inevitable effects of actions taken—irrespective of whether the individuals cared for all correlated outcomes or just some. When considering the order of events, be mindful of those actions that while intended to cause a specific outcome, also led to other inescapable results. These actions are crucial, as they hold the potential to reshape our understanding of intentionality and causality, enabling us to discern between actions that were purposefully undertaken and those which were merely following effects. <END>

When analyzing the presented scenarios, focus on deciphering the crucial elements leading to the outcomes. Endeavor to understand the complete context of the associated causal factors, bearing in mind that the conditions may sometimes occur simultaneously or multiply, which could drive the outcome. Every event holds significance, whether it is immediate or final in relation to the outcome, requires consideration. In interpreting causality, distinguish between actual planned causes and incidental consequences or mere sequences of events. Evaluate whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't occur, assisting in accurate determination of the contributing factors. Bear in mind that not every outcome is solely or directly caused by the event preceding it. In numerous instances, outcomes may be the result of multiple correlated factors. During your analysis, pay close attention to identifying the clear intentions and desired outcomes of the characters, differentiating them from tolerated or unforeseen consequences. Focus on understanding which outcomes were actively sought after versus those that were inevitable or passive results of the primary action. Always consider the hierarchical order of the events or intentions, which should guide you to understand which actions were purposefully caused and which ones were merely subsequent effects.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend tells him it's a precious heirloom and he can't part with it. Bill waits until later when his friend is in the bathroom, and slips the bookend into his bag. Finally, Bill leaves his friend's house with the stolen right-side Bartlett bookend in his bag. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?

gradient:
For example <1>

The prompt instructs the model to consider a wide range of factors, including immediate causes and the broader contexts and consequences of events. Given the intricate and multifaceted narrative of John's situation presented in the question, the model appears to have been swayed by the detailed narrative that includes significant reference to John's work and his subsequent exposure to asbestos. It may have de-emphasized the final event which was a medical error by a nurse which directly led to John's death. The model could also have assumed that the long-standing exposure to asbestos played a more significant causal role in the immediate outcome, despite the presented question focusing on John's premature death caused ostensibly by a medical error.

For example <2>

The model seems to have erred by over-integrating the concept of primary action and consequence mentioned in the prompt. Probably, the model considered Sue's purchase (Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend) to be the dominant or primary factor that resulted in the possession of the paired set of bookends, hence predicted "No", ignoring Bill's earlier illicit action. But without Bill's action, they wouldn't have had the paired set.

Improvements for the prompt could include:

1. Directing the model to give higher priority or weight to the immediate causes of an event, particularly when the question explicitly states that this is the focus.
   
2. Ensure the model differentiates and correctly correlates both incidental and major events that contribute to the final outcome.
   
3. Prompt the model to better recognize ambiguity within the narrative that may lead to different interpretations of the events' causality.

4. Encourage the model to understand the defined question focus better (i.e., the question directly focuses on John's premature death in Example 1 and on the possession of the paired set of bookends in example 2) and align its analysis around this specific focus. 

5. Remind the model not to overlook or underestimate deliberate actions and their consequences, as observed in the second example.

6. Balance the analysis between immediate significant events and multiple background factors.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> When analyzing the scenarios, concentrate on identifying the events leading directly to the end result. Recognize the key elements that invariably contribute to the outcomes. Aim to comprehend the comprehensive milieu of the causal factors, noting that events may arise simultaneously or multiply, potentially impacting the final outcome. Keep in mind that all occurences are pivotal, whether instant or ultimate, in respect to the outcome. In your causality interpretation, differentiate between intended causal actions and incidental outcomes or mere series of events. Evaluate the scenario considering whether the result would have been the same had any of the decisive events not transpired, assisting in the precise identification of contributing factors. Be aware that a cause isn't always the event that immediately precedes an outcome. Often, outcomes transpire as a combination of several correlated factors. Always pay particular attention to the clear intentions and anticipated outcomes of the characters, separating them from accidental or unforeseen outcomes. Emphasize on understanding which events were deliberately sought and which ones happened regardless of the primary action. Always review the hierarchical order of situations or intentions - doing so should guide you to distinguish between actions that were deliberately instigated and those that were simply resultant effects. Above all, ensure you grasp the question's key focus and align your analysis accordingly, giving higher weight to the immediate triggers of an event particularly when explicitly indicated. Don't overlook or underestimate intended actions in your analysis and ensure you balance your understanding between immediate action-consequence events and multiple backdrop factors that co-lead to the outcome. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly cause the circuit breaker to fail. The key elements leading to the circuit breaker failure were the simultaneous actions of all four researchers turning on their lamps at the same time. The restriction on the number of people using power at the same time was clearly stated, and the outcome was a result of all four individuals disregarding this restriction. Jim's specific action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was just one part of the sequence of events that led to the circuit breaker failure. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The prompt asks the model to avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality and to avoid binary interpretations, and this seems to have led the model to incorrectly conclude that Jim's action did not cause the circuit breaker to fail because it was one among a sequence of similar actions. However, in this particular scenario, every individual action contributes to the outcome, which is specifically designed in a way where if any one of the four people didn't turn on their lamp, the breaker wouldn't have failed. Therefore, Jim's disrespectful action of turning on his lamp on the day he's not supposed to can indeed be seen a causal factor in the breaker's failure.

The second error is related to the emphasis the prompt puts on distinguishing between incidental and deliberate outcomes and on considering the initial intentions, motives, and objectives. While this is generally sound advice for analysis, in this specific scenario, the intentions of the researchers don't have any influence on the outcome. The breaker fails regardless of whether the lamps were turned on deliberately or by accident. This focus on intention could have distracted the model and led it towards the wrong conclusion.

Based on these causes of errors, the improvements to be made on the prompt are as follow:

1. The prompt should clarify that while not mistaking sequences of events for causality, every event in a sequence could be a cause depending on the scenario. The model should be able to evaluate and discern whether one or all actions in a sequence can be causes.

2. The prompts should clarify unequivocally that outcomes could be either incidental or deliberate but regardless of the intention, an action could still lead to an outcome. In other words, the model should be encouraged to recognize that intentions don't always affect outcomes.

3. The prompt should contain more emphasis on alternative scenarios. Encouraging the model to consider "would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur?" could help it better understand the concept of causality and pinpoint the true contributing factors.

4. The prompts need to stress more on analysis of the rules or conditions that are given in a scenario, in this case the rule that the circuit breaker will fail if four lamps are turned on simultaneously. This rule was overlooked during the analysis. It's crucial that the model comprehends such given rules fully while synthesizing an answer.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken. Consider every contributing factor, including those that might not directly precede the outcome. Try to envision alternative scenarios: would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur? This can help to pinpoint the true contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are a result of one singular event or cause. In many instances, outcomes are born out of a combination of several factors. Avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. Comprehend the difference between someone/something intentionally causing an outcome or just being part of a sequence of events that led to it.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly cause the circuit breaker to fail. The key elements leading to the circuit breaker failure were the simultaneous actions of all four researchers turning on their lamps at the same time. The restriction on the number of people using power at the same time was clearly stated, and the outcome was a result of all four individuals disregarding this restriction. Jim's specific action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was just one part of the sequence of events that led to the circuit breaker failure. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
The first error in your example is a misunderstanding about causality.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken.

<START> Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in to the central computer while Zoe is already logged in is the trigger that causes the empty email to be sent to a non-existent email address. However, it is important to note that the actual cause of the empty email being sent is the company's policy of only allowing one person to be logged in at a time. Therefore, while Alice's action was the immediate cause of the email being sent, the ultimate cause was the company policy. So, in this case, Alice did cause the empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Model’s answer: Yes
Correct answer: No

Step by Step Analysis:

1. The model seems to be confused with the idea of immediate cause and contributing factors. While Alice logging in was the immediate trigger, it was not the root cause.

2. The model overlooks the deliberate violation of the policy by Zoe, which set the stage for the outcome. It arguably attributes equal blame to Alice who was merely following the company's rules.

3. It fails to properly apply the prompt's advice to "avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause," and wrongly assigns the role of cause to Alice.

Based on these reasons, the following aspects should be considered to improve the prompt:

1. Clarify the difference between a trigger and a cause. Triggers alone are not typically considered causes unless they move the event series from a state of potentiality to actuality. 

2. Emphasize the consideration of violations or negligence in policy when determining the causes of an event. 

3. Provide guidance about the proportional attribution of causality when multiple actors or events contribute to an outcome. 

 4. Strengthen the instruction about distinguishing between intentional actions causing an outcome and an action just being part of a sequence that led to it.

5. Promote a more nuanced understanding of causality beyond simple binary interpretations to reflect the complexity of events.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision did not directly cause the patient's recovery. The recovery was likely due to the drug being administered, which was initiated by the intern's decision to use it. The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug, despite the hospital policy, did play a role in allowing the drug to be administered, but it was not the direct cause of the patient's recovery.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The typical person would likely answer option (A) Yes, believing that the fact that the black wire touched the battery caused the machine to short circuit. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In the first example, the model didn't correctly identify the causal relationship between the attending doctor's approval and the patient's recovery. The model acknowledges the attending doctor's decision led to the drug being administered, which in turn caused the patient's recovery, but still identified the attending doctor's decision as not causal. It seems the model failed to account for the indirect causes leading to the final event, despite the prompt implying to account for both direct and indirect causes.

In the second instance, the model marked the black wire touching the battery as the cause of the short circuit, even though the prompt explicitly advocates against a binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. The short circuit was caused by both the black and red wire touching the battery. Here the model over-emphasized the role of the black wire since it was designed to connect the battery, enforcing direct causality and neglecting the required co-presence of the red wire.

These errors denote two main problems:

1. The model struggles to understand the concept of indirect causality. It tends to focus more on the immediate cause-result relationship, which negatively affects its ability to recognize sequential events with culminating effects.
   
2. The model does not fully grasp the concept of multiple co-requisite causes for an event. The instances where the event is triggered by a combination of several factors seem to confuse the model.

To improve the prompt, several aspects can be focused on:
- Reiterate the importance of indirect causality. Make sure it's clear that outcomes don't always align with the final action preceding them but could be a result of a sequence of previous actions.
- Emphasize on the significance of multiple factors contributing to an outcome. A co-requisite cause scenario (where more than one condition must be present to cause an outcome) should be well-highlighted.
- Add an instance where it explicitly mentions that authorization to perform an action can be recognized as a causal factor. This will handle the confusion observed in the first instance.
- In the introduction, stress more on not linking the outcome to just one single event particularly when that event is meant to happen, as seen in the second instance. This can help the model to avoid such misconceptions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken.

This involves delving into the intentions, motives, and objectives which drove the decisions or actions taken, not just focusing on the resultant effect. Consider each contributing factor, inclusive of those that might not immediately precede the outcome. Imagine alternative scenarios: would the outcome vary if certain events were altered or non-existent? This could assist in clarifying the genuine contributing elements. Acknowledge that not all events are driven by a single cause. Outcomes, in many instances, exist as a result of a blend of numerous factors. Be sure to avoid oversimplified cause-and-effect narratives where the directly preceding cause is misconstrued as the only determinant. Also, understand the difference between instances where an outcome is deliberately caused or when an entity is merely part of a chain of events leading up to it. Comprehend that authorizations to perform actions are also causal elements. Consider swaying away from attributing an outcome to a singular event, particularly in cases where it's a given action or a predetermined event. <END>

cur_prompt: Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM.

gradient:
For <1>:

Question:
Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Wrong Answer: 
(B) No

Reason:
The prompt emphasizes the need to recognize the difference between a participant in a sequence of events and actually instigating an event. It also advises understanding that intent doesn't necessarily correlate to outcomes. The language model seems to focus on the sniper's lack of intent to heat the gun barrel, categorizing it as an incidental outcome; however, it fails to recognize that the heating of the barrel isn't an outcome itself, rather a direct consequence of the sniper's intentional action (firing the gun). Even though the sniper doesn't care about the gun heating, he knowingly initiated the action that caused it.

(B) No

The model interprets that Wayne's lack of action (not changing the position of the device) is not the cause of the device charging. It misses the point that by not altering the position of the device, Wayne effectively maintained the necessary conditions for the device to charge. Here, the model has overcomplicated the interpretation of causality and disregarded Wayne's inaction as a contributing factor to the event's outcome. 

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarify and Expand on 'Intention':
   The model seems to be overly focused on intent, and thus may misinterpret scenarios where an action (or inaction, as in example 2) directly contributes to outcomes, regardless of initial intent. 

2. Recognize Inaction as a Potentially Contributing Element:
   The prompt should clarify that inaction can be equally influential in causing outcomes. In the given scenarios, the model did not identify inaction as a cause.

3. Distinguish between Outcomes and Consequences:
   Clearly define and distinguish between an outcome and a direct or indirect consequence of actions. Such a distinction would have likely provided the corrected interpretation in example 1.

4. Simplification isn't always Misinterpretation:
   The prompt warns against oversimplified interpretations. However, often, simple causal links or inactions, as in the second example, can lead to the targeted outcome.

5. Emphasize on Direct and Indirect Causes:
   The prompt can better emphasize the difference between direct and indirect causes in the sequence of events leading to an outcome. This would assist in situations where direct causes are not deliberate but still integral to the result.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question as follows:
No, the device is not fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device. The device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging to occur. Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For <1>:

Question:
Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Wrong Answer: 
(B) No

Reason:
The prompt emphasizes the need to recognize the difference between a participant in a sequence of events and actually instigating an event. It also advises understanding that intent doesn't necessarily correlate to outcomes. The language model seems to focus on the sniper's lack of intent to heat the gun barrel, categorizing it as an incidental outcome; however, it fails to recognize that the heating of the barrel isn't an outcome itself, rather a direct consequence of the sniper's intentional action (firing the gun). Even though the sniper doesn't care about the gun heating, he knowingly initiated the action that caused it.


For <2>:

Question:
Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Wrong Answer: 
(B) No

Reason:
The model interprets that Wayne's lack of action (not changing the position of the device) is not the cause of the device charging. It misses the point that by not altering the position of the device, Wayne effectively maintained the necessary conditions for the device to charge. Here, the model has overcomplicated the interpretation of causality and disregarded Wayne's inaction as a contributing factor to the event's outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken. Consider every contributing factor, including those that might not directly precede the outcome. Try to envision alternative scenarios: would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur? This can help to pinpoint the true contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are a result of one singular event or cause. In many instances, outcomes are born out of a combination of several factors. Avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. Comprehend the difference between someone/something intentionally causing an outcome or just being part of a sequence of events that led to it.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Carefully examine the provided scenarios utilizing a comprehensive approach to pinpoint the critical factors that influence the outcomes. Every event, no matter its position in the timeline leading to the end result, could play a significant role. Keep in mind that a string of events is different from cause and effect. Thus, your analysis should differentiate between a sequence and the actual causes; every action in a sequence may or may not be a cause. Make a distinction between incidental and direct outcomes, but understand that the initial intentions behind an action do not always influence the result. Keep your focus broad to account for all factors, even if they do not directly precede the outcome. Think about how the scenarios might shift if certain events were altered or did not happen - this may help identify the real contributing factors. Remember, not every outcome comes from a single event or cause; often, the culminating effect of several incidents leads to the results. Be wary of overly-simplistic interpretations where the immediate cause, whether intentional, incidental, or unintentional, is mistaken for the exclusive cause. Inaction can sometimes be as potent as an action in influencing outcomes. Understand the difference between causing an event intentionally and being a part of a sequence that led to an event, even if unintended and indirect, the impact could be significant. Lastly, adhere to the conditions and rules detailed in the scenario as these often guide the final outcomes. <END>

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
In the first example, the model answered 'No' when asked whether Jane's log-on caused the crash. This question is relatively straightforward given the system rules, and Jane's action was the trigger. It seems the model struggled because this scenario involved disregard for a rule, which might lead to some confusion. Jane has unintentionally caused something by deliberately breaking a rule. Maybe the model weighed the contributions of the two users similarly, without regard for rules or official instructions. This seems more of a case of a misunderstanding of the question's structure rather than the prompt.

Example 2:
In the second example, the model perceived the cause of winning the bet as the last shooting, which is incorrect. Louie had already met the conditions by scoring a 3-point shot, so the later layup didn't cause him to win. Here, the model seemed to have difficulties discerning between the last event and the actual causative factor, incorrectly attributing the reward to the final action, not understanding that the conditions for winning were already met.

Example 3:
For the third example, the model incorrectly answered 'No' when asked whether Jim turning his lamp was the cause for the circuit's break. All three actions were required for the breaker to fail, and if one of them were missing, the breaker would not have failed. Here, the model might be adhering too closely to the instruction to avoid oversimplifying interpretation where the direct cause isn't the only one.

Possible improvements:
1. Improve instructions to appreciate time sequence: Mention that while multiple factors may contribute to an outcome, the model should pay attention to which events occurred first and were therefore the primary causes. This might assist with error types seen in examples one and two.
   
2. Balance sequence vs causation better: Reinforce in the instructions that while the last event in a sequence isn't necessarily the cause, in certain circumstances, it may be. This might help with error types seen in the third example.

3. Emphasize rule understanding: Assert the importance of rules or instructions given in scenarios. Stress upon the model to look out for regulations and understand their violation can be intentional and lead to essential outcomes.

4. Highlighting causality in cooperative circumstances: Point out that if multiple items, actions, or individuals are required for an outcome, the absence of any one could prevent the result. Consequently, each could be a contributing cause, as seen in the third example.

5. Focus on Conditional outcomes: Clarify that if an outcome depends upon either of the two or more conditions met, the first one to be satisfied becomes the cause rather than what happened later. This clarification will assist in avoiding the error in the second example.

Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:
In the first example, the model answered 'No' when asked whether Jane's log-on caused the crash. This question is relatively straightforward given the system rules, and Jane's action was the trigger. It seems the model struggled because this scenario involved disregard for a rule, which might lead to some confusion. Jane has unintentionally caused something by deliberately breaking a rule. Maybe the model weighed the contributions of the two users similarly, without regard for rules or official instructions. This seems more of a case of a misunderstanding of the question's structure rather than the prompt.

Example 2:
In the second example, the model perceived the cause of winning the bet as the last shooting, which is incorrect. Louie had already met the conditions by scoring a 3-point shot, so the later layup didn't cause him to win. Here, the model seemed to have difficulties discerning between the last event and the actual causative factor, incorrectly attributing the reward to the final action, not understanding that the conditions for winning were already met.

Example 3:
For the third example, the model incorrectly answered 'No' when asked whether Jim turning his lamp was the cause for the circuit's break. All three actions were required for the breaker to fail, and if one of them were missing, the breaker would not have failed. Here, the model might be adhering too closely to the instruction to avoid oversimplifying interpretation where the direct cause isn't the only one.

Possible improvements:
1. Improve instructions to appreciate time sequence: Mention that while multiple factors may contribute to an outcome, the model should pay attention to which events occurred first and were therefore the primary causes. This might assist with error types seen in examples one and two.
   
2. Balance sequence vs causation better: Reinforce in the instructions that while the last event in a sequence isn't necessarily the cause, in certain circumstances, it may be. This might help with error types seen in the third example.

3. Emphasize rule understanding: Assert the importance of rules or instructions given in scenarios. Stress upon the model to look out for regulations and understand their violation can be intentional and lead to essential outcomes.

4. Highlighting causality in cooperative circumstances: Point out that if multiple items, actions, or individuals are required for an outcome, the absence of any one could prevent the result. Consequently, each could be a contributing cause, as seen in the third example.

5. Focus on Conditional outcomes: Clarify that if an outcome depends upon either of the two or more conditions met, the first one to be satisfied becomes the cause rather than what happened later. This clarification will assist in avoiding the error in the second example.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken. Consider every contributing factor, including those that might not directly precede the outcome. Try to envision alternative scenarios: would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur? This can help to pinpoint the true contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are a result of one singular event or cause. In many instances, outcomes are born out of a combination of several factors. Avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. Comprehend the difference between someone/something intentionally causing an outcome or just being part of a sequence of events that led to it.
(4) Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze the presented scenarios by applying a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to identify the essential factors leading to the end results. Note that every event, regardless of its position in the sequence, may have a contributory role, and sequences of events shouldn't be misunderstood as actual causality. Differentiate effectively between a sequence of events and causation, understanding that an event within a sequence may or may not be integral to the outcome. Strive to distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, keeping in mind that even though intentionality is relevant, it doesn't always influence the resulting outcome. Give every potential contributing factor its due consideration, even those not directly preceding the outcome. Reflect on hypothetical scenarios: does altering or omitting certain events impact the outcome, and can the result exist without them? Evaluations like these may assist in identifying the true contributing factors. Note that outcomes often result from the cumulative effect of multiple events rather than one isolated incident, and avoid oversimplifying by attributing the outcome solely to the most proximate cause. Comprehend the distinction between an entity purposefully instigating an outcome and merely being a part of the succession of events leading to it. Prioritize understanding given conditions or rules within scenarios, as these can have a shaping influence on outcomes. Emphasize on understanding the role of each individual and the chronological order of events to accurately determine the causality, especially in scenarios with rules or in situations where certain conditions lead to outcomes. When outcomes depend upon meeting any of multiple conditions, the event satisfying a condition first becomes the primary cause over subsequent fulfilling events. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Imagine that there is a man out in the woods who is participating in a hunting competition. After spending hours waiting for a deer to cross his path, the hunter suddenly sees the largest deer he has ever seen. If he can only kill this deer, he will surely win the competition. So, the hunter gets the deer in his sights -- but at the last second, he notices that there is a group of bird-watchers just on the other side of the deer. The hunter realizes that if he shoots the deer, the bullet will definitely hit one of the birdwatchers as well. But he does not care at all about the bird watchers -- he just wants to win the competition. So, he shoots and kills the deer. And as expected, the bullet ends up hitting one of the bird-watchers as well. Did the man intentionally shoot the bird-watcher?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The reason the prompt leads to a wrong answer in this scenario can be attributed to the constraints or guidelines put forth as part of the prompt. Specifically, the prompt advises to "Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome." Under this guidance, the language model might have interpreted the hunter as merely being a unit in the sequence of events that led to the outcome, rather than intentionally shooting the bird-watcher. However, ethically, knowing the birdwatcher could be hit and choosing not to prevent it denotes intent. 

Example 2:
For this example, the prompt's direction to distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes and to carefully analyze sequences of events might have led to a misunderstanding. The way the statement was framed may have made the language model believe that Louie’s 3-point shot was the deliberate factor for his win, discounting the fact that the layup alone was enough for him to win the bet. 

After considering these points, the prompt could be improved in the following ways:

1. Intentionality should be clearly defined: The prompt should emphasize that not preventing a foreseeable detrimental outcome can often be perceived as intent.

2. Outlining the causality requirement more precisely: Whether a singular event can lead to an outcome, it should be considered causative, even if other events occur afterward. 

3. Simplifying the concept of causality: Rather than guiding the model to distinguish between sequences of events and actual causality, it might be more beneficial to equip the model with a more straightforward understanding of cause and effect. This would ideally focus on whether an event directly leads to or significantly contributes to an outcome. 

4. Adding focus on requirements and conditions: The prompt could emphasize the need to pay special attention to the conditions leading to the outcome. For example, in scenario 2, merely fulfilling one part of the condition was enough to win the bet. 

By incorporating these suggestions, we can make the prompt clearer, more concise, and better equipped to deal with complex scenarios.

For this example, the prompt's direction to distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes and to carefully analyze sequences of events might have led to a misunderstanding. The way the statement was framed may have made the language model believe that Louie’s 3-point shot was the deliberate factor for his win, discounting the fact that the layup alone was enough for him to win the bet. 

After considering these points, the prompt could be improved in the following ways:

1. Intentionality should be clearly defined: The prompt should emphasize that not preventing a foreseeable detrimental outcome can often be perceived as intent.

2. Outlining the causality requirement more precisely: Whether a singular event can lead to an outcome, it should be considered causative, even if other events occur afterward. 

3. Simplifying the concept of causality: Rather than guiding the model to distinguish between sequences of events and actual causality, it might be more beneficial to equip the model with a more straightforward understanding of cause and effect. This would ideally focus on whether an event directly leads to or significantly contributes to an outcome. 

4. Adding focus on requirements and conditions: The prompt could emphasize the need to pay special attention to the conditions leading to the outcome. For example, in scenario 2, merely fulfilling one part of the condition was enough to win the bet. 

By incorporating these suggestions, we can make the prompt clearer, more concise, and better equipped to deal with complex scenarios.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided scenarios and make a reasoned judgment about the main causal factors contributing to the outcomes. Consider all potential causes and interpret causality accurately, even in cases of multiple contributing factors.
(2) Deeply analyze the given scenarios and identify the integral elements causing the outcomes. Emphasize understanding the full context of the associated causal factors, taking into account the simultaneous or multiple conditions that may necessitate the outcome. Keep in mind that every event has its significance, regardless of how immediate or final it is in relation to the outcome. In causality interpretation, differentiate between actual causes and mere sequence of events. Assess whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't happen, to accurately determine the contributing factors. Remember, the event preceding the outcome directly isn't always the single or primary cause, as in many instances, an outcome is the product of the culmination of several factors.
(3) Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken. Consider every contributing factor, including those that might not directly precede the outcome. Try to envision alternative scenarios: would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur? This can help to pinpoint the true contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are a result of one singular event or cause. In many instances, outcomes are born out of a combination of several factors. Avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. Comprehend the difference between someone/something intentionally causing an outcome or just being part of a sequence of events that led to it.
(4) Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome.

response:
<START> Carefully analyze the given scenarios to ascertain the key events or actions leading to the outcomes. Always consider the timing of events, but do not attribute significance solely based on sequence. Aim to distinguish between actual cause and effect and mere progression of events. Also, differentiate between incidental and deliberate outcomes, keeping in mind that an intentional action may not necessarily impact the resulting outcome. It's crucial to realize that knowingly not avoiding a foreseeable harmful outcome can be seen as intent. Understand that a single event satisfying a requirement for an outcome is often considered a causal factor, even if there are other contributing factors. Engage in thoughtful consideration of all contributing factors, not just those immediately preceding the outcome. Think about what might happen if certain events were modified or didn't occur altogether - would the final outcome still be the same? Keep in mind that not all outcomes arise from a single cause but are often the result of an accumulation of events or factors. Seek to avoid oversimplified causal interpretations. Recognize that an individual or entity may be a part of the sequence of events leading to an outcome without necessarily being the intentional cause. Lastly, make sure to properly consider any given conditions or rules within the scenario that may significantly influence the outcome. Please answer based on these guidelines. <END>

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the model answered the question incorrectly due to several possible issues within the prompt:

1. The prompt's statement that an action "can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal" might have led the model to assign causation to Louie's layup. In reality, because the condition of the bet was already fulfilled by the 3-point shot, the delayed outcome of the layup did not contribute to the result. This reveals the model's failure to understand temporal sequence in causality.

2. The prompt emphasizes both direct and indirect results of actions, which may have led the model to consider all actions (like the layup) as being causally significant, despite the fact that the condition of the bet was already met earlier.

3. The prompt doesn't instruct the model to consider the context, event order, or magnitude of different actions, leading to the possible misinterpretation of the layup's importance.

Wrong Example 2:

In this situation, the model again took the incorrect choice, based on potential issues with the prompt:

1. The expansive interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause' led the model to strongly link John's job (as a cause) to his death (the effect), despite the fact the cause of his death was the immediate allergic reaction to the wrong medication.

2. The prompt emphasizes both direct and indirect results of actions but doesn't prioritize the recent or direct results over the distant or indirect ones, causing the model to overemphasize the role of John's job.

3. The prompt doesn't specify that the cause should ideally be the most immediate or the most major contributing factor to the outcome. As a result, it overlooks his job's inability to immediately cause his death.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Specify that the model should consider the temporal sequence in causality and give less weight to actions that occur after the result has already been achieved or conditions have been met.

2. Instruct the model to prioritize more immediate and direct causes when multiple factors lead to an outcome.

3. Include instructions for distinguishing between main and contributing causes.

4. Stress that while indirect actions and outcomes are to be analyzed, they should not necessarily be viewed as equal to direct results.

5. Ask the model to consider the complexity surrounding 'intentionality' and 'cause,' only attributing outcomes to actions knowingly pursued with an awareness of the likely outcomes. 

6. Encourage the model to analyze and reason based on the context instead of simply linking actions and outcomes.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?

The receptionist in the philosophy department keeps her desk stocked with pens. The administrative assistants are allowed to take the pens, but faculty members are supposed to buy their own. The administrative assistants typically do take the pens. Unfortunately, so do the faculty members. The receptionist has repeatedly emailed them reminders that only administrative assistants are allowed to take the pens. On Monday morning, one of the administrative assistants encounters Professor Smith walking past the receptionist's desk. Both take pens. Later that day, the receptionist needs to take an important message... but she has a problem. There are no pens left on her desk. Did the administrative assistant cause the problem?

gradient:
Let's evaluate each example:

Example 1: 
In this case, the model wrongly assumes that a person who is aware of an evil consequence of their actions and goes ahead with it anyway, is doing the evil intentionally. This ascribes intentionality to Bob in the harming of the townspeople's health. However, the example clearly states that Bob states he doesn't care about the health of the townspeople. His goal was to steal money, not to harm people. The prompt is assuming broad interpretations of 'intentionality', leading to the incorrect answer. 

Example 2: 
Here, the model fails to correctly identify culpability. Alice was following the rules and logged in when she was supposed to, while Zoe was the one who violated the policy. But because Alice's action triggered the email (because Zoe was unexpectedly logged in), the model attributes the cause to Alice. The prompt's failure to distinguish between causality that arises from a violation of rules or unexpected circumstances and normal causality seems to be at fault here.

Example 3: 
The administrative assistant was allowed, even expected, to take the pens. The assistant's behavior was within the rules, and she would not normally be considered as a cause for the problem of no pens left. However, the model ascribes causality to the assistant. The prompt seems to lead the model to conclude that anyone involved in a situation (even those playing by the rules) can be held causally responsible for the outcome.

For the above reasons, the prompt needs improvement in the following aspects:

1. Differentiation of intention:
   The prompt should differentiate between primary intention (doing something with the primary goal of achieving a certain outcome) and secondary intention (doing something despite knowing that a secondary outcome might result). 

2. Conditional Direct Causality:
   The model should be asked to consider circumstances where direct causality arises from a wrongful act or unexpected occurrence (like breaking rules), and identify the causality accordingly.

3. Several Consequences: 
   The prompt should also instruct the model to evaluate whether a person's actions resulted in several consequences - both intended and unintended, and weigh them differently according to the actor's expectations, instructions and rule-compliance.

4. Varying degrees of causal responsibility:
   The aspect of varying degrees of causal responsibility--where one can be part of an event yet bear more, less, or no causal responsibility based on their intentions, actions, rules, and prevailing circumstances--needs to be taken into account. 

5. Broad vs. strict interpretation: 
   The prompt should specify when to use broad interpretation and when to use strict interpretation of 'intentionality' and 'cause', rather than leaving it ambiguous.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the first wrong example:

1. The language model interpreted the cause of the machine's short circuit to be both the wires touching the battery. But, the correct interpretation should be that the unusual contact of the red wire with the battery caused the short circuit since the black wire was supposed to touch the battery under normal conditions. 

2. The statement in the prompt "if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome" is not applicable here as there's no 'actor' intentionally causing the wires to touch the battery.

3. The model seems to be over-rationalizing the causal relationship, not considering the normal operations context – that the black wire's connection to the battery is typical, and it's actually the red wire causing the issue.

For the second wrong example:

1. The model highlighted the action 'David changed the temperature setting' and connected it directly to the outcome 'the clothes dried in sixty minutes'. The fact that the cycle was already set to MAX DRY and thus the clothes would dry in sixty minutes irrespective of the temperature setting was not taken into account. 

2. The instruction in the prompt to consider 'direct and indirect results of actions' might have led the model to the assumption that David changing the settings, although unnecessary, could be seen as an indirect cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes.

Aspects to improve the prompt:
1. Make clear that normal or expected actions that align with an established pattern should not be considered as the direct cause in the cases where anomalies induce specific results.
2. Instruct the model to consider factors which in isolation would or would not lead to the same result when evaluating causation.
3. Include more clarifications about disregarding unnecessary action’s outcomes that are misinterpreted as cause, as seen in the second example.
4. Improve the prompt to make the model give more emphasis to the stated contextual conditions while interpreting causation.
5. Give more explicit instructions for the model to identify the unexpected or irregular event when many different factors lead to a specific consequence.

Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

gradient:
1. Question Examination:

The question revolves around the causal attribution of a patient’s recovery to a drug, specifically whether the pharmacist's agreement to administer the drug led to the patient's recovery. In this context, two notable facts are present: the intern's decision to use the drug initially and the final approval from the doctor despite concerns. The pharmacist's role here was to check stock availability.

2. Wrong Answer Examination:

The provided prompt instructs the model to consider both direct and indirect consequences, apply 'intentionality' and disregard unnecessary actions to effectively analyze causal attribution. In response, the model chose (A) Yes, that the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. The prompt’s phrasing could have confused the model into considering the pharmacist’s approval as a necessary action towards recovery, thus attributing causality incorrectly.

3. Reasons for incorrect response:

a. Lack of differentiation between roles: The prompt didn't lead the model correctly to differentiate between the roles of the individuals involved (Intern, pharmacist, and doctor). The pharmacist only checked the stock availability of the drug but didn’t make an informed decision regarding the effectiveness or appropriateness of the drug for the patient's condition.
 
b. Ignoring established patterns: The prompt instructs the model not to consider established patterns as the direct cause, leading the model to undervalue the doctor's decision, an established pattern, as a cause.

c. Misinterpretation of indirect consequences: The prompt's statement on considering both direct and indirect consequences may have led the model to overemphasize the "indirect" role of the pharmacist hence attributing false causality.

4. Areas of Improvement:
a. Open dialogs for role differentiation: The prompt should incorporate language to direct the model to consider individual roles and their impact on a situation.
  
b. Acknowledge established patterns: The prompt should allow for some consideration of established patterns, especially in official contexts like a hospital where policies are important.

c. Clarify interpretation of indirect consequences: The prompt should offer a more nuanced view of direct and indirect consequences, emphasis on the primary decision-maker, and less emphasis on logistical roles. 

d. Consider 'unintentional causality': The prompt should also consider cases where indirect actions that were not intentionally aiming at the result also caused the situation. 

e. Restructure the understanding of 'necessary actions': Most of the prompt revolves around considering 'necessary actions'. The model misinterpreted 'necessary' and failed to evaluate the necessity from the perspective of the decision-maker who is most informed about the situation.

Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START>Analyze and evaluate questions about causal attribution, focusing particularly on both direct and indirect outcomes of actions. Keep in mind that 'intentionality' and 'cause' can be perceived differently. If an actor knowingly takes an action that leads to a certain outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that is not the main goal. But, always differentiate the roles of involved parties and prioritize those who have a direct and pertinent influence on the consequences. Traditional patterns or expected outcomes should not necessarily be de-emphasized; importance must be given to the situational appropriateness whether they lead to specific outcomes or not. In situations where several factors converge, pay more attention to unexpected or non-routine events that defy regular patterns. Evaluate causality by assessing contributing factors that have independently led to a similar outcome, and try to filter out outcomes of actions that are not critical for obtaining the end result. Be cautious while evaluating ‘necessary actions’, keeping in mind that ‘necessity’ should be from the perspective of the entities who hold the final decision and are most informed about possible consequences. Use common sense and consistency with majority opinion when there's ambiguity around intentionality or causality, but keep in mind unintentional causality and indirect influences too. <END>

Jake desperately wants to have more money. He knows that he will inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But Jake isn't very good at using his rifle. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet hits her directly in the heart. She dies instantly. Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?

In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

The question involves determining whether Jake shot his aunt intentionally. Given the information that Jake's hand slipped and the shot was not expressly intentional, a typical person might argue that his act was unintentional. However, the model concluded that Jake shot his aunt intentionally based on his initial set of actions (raising the rifle, getting his aunt in the sights). The model seemed to negatively weigh the "slip of hand" incident and concluded based on the initial intent.

The issue here is that the prompt doesn't explicitly mention how to gauge the causal attribution when there's a dichotomy between the original intent and the actual act.

In this question, the role of different actors leading to a single outcome is evaluated. The pharmacist's role was purely procedural (checking if the drug was in stock), and they had no involvement in deciding whether the drug was appropriate for the patient. That decision was made by the attending doctor. Yet, the model attributes causality to the pharmacist's action, implying they contributed to the patient's recovery. 

The problem here is that while the prompt talks about disregarding outcomes of unnecessary actions, it does not clarify how to distinguish between actors whose actions are procedural and don't directly contribute to the outcome vs. those whose actions are directly linked to the outcome.

The question here revolves around whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. The information provided states that Bob was indifferent to the health of the townspeople and was primarily concerned with stealing money. However, the model attributes intentionality to Bob's act of harming the health of the townspeople.

This again can be traced back to the prompt, which provides guidelines for interpreting 'intentionality'. Here a stricter lens would lead to the conclusion that Bob isn't directly responsible for the harm caused to the townspeople as his primary motive was to steal money, not to harm people.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:
1. Provide clear instructions about how the model should weigh initial intent against actual outcomes when analyzing scenarios.
2. Emphasize that the model should prioritize actions directly leading to an outcome over procedural actions in the process.
3. Add clear instructions for the model to distinguish between primary and secondary outcomes and to evaluate intentionality accordingly.
4. Recommend that the model should consider the principle of double effect in moral reasoning, where primary and secondary effects of actions are differentiated.
5. Include a directive to consider probable "reasons" and "motives" behind an action while assessing intentionality.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jake desperately wants to have more money. He knows that he will inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But Jake isn't very good at using his rifle. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet hits her directly in the heart. She dies instantly. Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Most typical people would likely answer (A) Yes, as Jake's actions of raising the rifle, getting his aunt in the sights, and pressing the trigger indicate intentionality towards causing harm. The fact that his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun and the shot went off accidentally would not negate the intentional nature of his actions leading up to the outcome.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
The typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. The pharmacist's quick approval allowed the drug to be administered in a timely manner, leading to the patient's immediate recovery. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.

<START> Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome. In cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint. Make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions as it could provide crucial context to the actor's intent. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Long ago, when John was only 17 years old, he got a job working for a large manufacturing company. He started out working on an assembly line for minimum wage, but after a few years at the company, he was given a choice between two line manager positions. He could stay in the woodwork division, which is where he was currently working. Or he could move to the plastics division. John was unsure what to do because he liked working in the woodwork division, but he also thought it might be worth trying something different. He finally decided to switch to the plastics division and try something new. For the last 30 years, John has worked as a production line supervisor in the plastics division. After the first year there, the plastics division was moved to a different building with more space. Unfortunately, through the many years he worked there, John was exposed to asbestos, a highly carcinogenic substance. Most of the plastics division was quite safe, but the small part in which John worked was exposed to asbestos fibers. And now, although John has never smoked a cigarette in his life and otherwise lives a healthy lifestyle, he has a highly progressed and incurable case of lung cancer at the age of 50. John had seen three cancer specialists, all of whom confirmed the worst: that, except for pain, John's cancer was untreatable and he was absolutely certain to die from it very soon (the doctors estimated no more than 2 months). Yesterday, while John was in the hospital for a routine medical appointment, a new nurse accidentally administered the wrong medication to him. John was allergic to the drug and he immediately went into shock and experienced cardiac arrest (a heart attack). Doctors attempted to resuscitate him but he died minutes after the medication was administered. Did John's job cause his premature death?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine if John's job caused his premature death, we need to consider both direct and indirect consequences of his actions. Working in the plastics division exposed John to asbestos, which is a known carcinogen and likely contributed to his lung cancer. This can be seen as a direct consequence of his job choice. However, the administration of the wrong medication by the new nurse resulted in John going into shock and experiencing cardiac arrest, ultimately leading to his death. This event can also be viewed as a direct cause of his premature death.

Therefore, in this scenario, both John's job in the plastics division and the administration of the wrong medication can be considered direct causes of his premature death.

Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Suzy is the only one permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, whereas Billy is the only one permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Billy is not permitted to log into the central computer in the morning. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:
Question: Did John's job cause his premature death?
Model's response: (A) Yes
Correct label: B

Reasons for Incorrectness:
1. The model incorrectly evaluated consequences of actions - it combined consequences of two unrelated actions, instead of individually evaluating them. If we break down the circumstance, the death was caused by the wrong medication and the cardiac arrest that followed. The job caused an underlying health condition (lung cancer) but this was not the direct cause of death.
2. Over-reliance on connection between actions and outcomes: The model applied the rule that if an actor is aware an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is intentional towards that resulting outcome. Being exposed to asbestos resulted in lung cancer and hence, the job seemed to appear as a cause of death.
3. Failure to appropriately consider routine events: Although John had lung cancer, the routine medical appointment turned into an irregular event due to a mistake.

Wrong example 2:
Question: Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Model's response: (A) Yes
Correct label: B

Reasons for Incorrectness:
1. Misinterpretation of actor's intention: The model, by interpreting Suzy logging into the computer in accordance with the company's policy as intentional to cause the email deletion, ignored the issue that Billy, against the rules, logged into the computer in the morning.
2. Inability to evaluate the established pattern: The pattern that nobody was aware that logging in simultaneously would cause deletion of emails was overlooked in deciding the cause.
3. Misclassification of a normal event vs an irregular one: Suzy logging into the computer is a routine event, whilst Billy logging into the computer is the irregular event that led to the unexpected outcome.

Aspect to improve the prompt based on the reasons:
1. Better emphasize the separate analysis of diverse causal factors: The language model should be prompted to separately analyze different actions and their direct and indirect consequences rather than mixing their impacts.
2. The roles of different actors and difference in their intentions should be more effectively evaluated in the context.
3. The prompt needs to help the language model put a stronger focus on identifying and understanding unexpected events from the normal routine, as these are often the root cause when problems arise.
4. The prompt needs to guide a better understanding that awareness of potential outcomes or strict adherence to rules does not necessarily mean they are the cause when an unexpected outcome occurs. This improves the model's understanding about 'intentionality' and 'cause'.

Therefore, in this scenario, both John's job in the plastics division and the administration of the wrong medication can be considered direct causes of his premature death. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

The model's input is:
Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Billy and Suzy work for the same company. They work in different rooms, and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Nobody at the company is aware that if two people are logged into the central computer at the same time, some spam emails containing important customer information are immediately deleted from the central computer. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Suzy is the only one permitted to log into the central computer in the mornings, whereas Billy is the only one permitted to log into the central computer in the afternoons. Billy is not permitted to log into the central computer in the morning. Today at 9 am, Billy and Suzy both log into the central computer at the same time. Immediately, some work emails containing important customer information are deleted from the central computer. Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Suzy did cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong example 1:
Question: Did John's job cause his premature death?
Model's response: (A) Yes
Correct label: B

Reasons for Incorrectness:
1. The model incorrectly evaluated consequences of actions - it combined consequences of two unrelated actions, instead of individually evaluating them. If we break down the circumstance, the death was caused by the wrong medication and the cardiac arrest that followed. The job caused an underlying health condition (lung cancer) but this was not the direct cause of death.
2. Over-reliance on connection between actions and outcomes: The model applied the rule that if an actor is aware an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is intentional towards that resulting outcome. Being exposed to asbestos resulted in lung cancer and hence, the job seemed to appear as a cause of death.
3. Failure to appropriately consider routine events: Although John had lung cancer, the routine medical appointment turned into an irregular event due to a mistake.

Wrong example 2:
Question: Did Suzy cause the central computer to delete some work emails containing important customer information?
Model's response: (A) Yes
Correct label: B

Reasons for Incorrectness:
1. Misinterpretation of actor's intention: The model, by interpreting Suzy logging into the computer in accordance with the company's policy as intentional to cause the email deletion, ignored the issue that Billy, against the rules, logged into the computer in the morning.
2. Inability to evaluate the established pattern: The pattern that nobody was aware that logging in simultaneously would cause deletion of emails was overlooked in deciding the cause.
3. Misclassification of a normal event vs an irregular one: Suzy logging into the computer is a routine event, whilst Billy logging into the computer is the irregular event that led to the unexpected outcome.

Aspect to improve the prompt based on the reasons:
1. Better emphasize the separate analysis of diverse causal factors: The language model should be prompted to separately analyze different actions and their direct and indirect consequences rather than mixing their impacts.
2. The roles of different actors and difference in their intentions should be more effectively evaluated in the context.
3. The prompt needs to help the language model put a stronger focus on identifying and understanding unexpected events from the normal routine, as these are often the root cause when problems arise.
4. The prompt needs to guide a better understanding that awareness of potential outcomes or strict adherence to rules does not necessarily mean they are the cause when an unexpected outcome occurs. This improves the model's understanding about 'intentionality' and 'cause'.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:

Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality.

cur_prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome.

Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the model was asked whether Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup. The model predicted that the typical answer would be (A) Yes. However, the correct answer is (B) No. Louie had already won the bet when he made the 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game, regardless of the outcome of the layup at the end. The model failed to determine that the layup was an additional, unnecessary action given the conditions of the bet. The prompt may have instilled a focus on the final outcome (the layup) rather than the initial accomplishment (the 3-point shot) which was the true cause for Louie winning the bet. 

Wrong Example 2:
In the second example, the question centered on whether the black wire touching the battery caused a short circuit. The model predicted that the typical answer would be (A) Yes. However, the correct answer is (B) No. The short circuit occurred not because the black wire touched the battery, but because the black and the red wire both touched the battery simultaneously. The question presents a condition where either wire touching the battery alone would not cause a short circuit. Here, the model failed to recognize the combined causation enlisted in the problem. The prompt may have overly emphasized the idea that actions directly leading to the outcome should be deemed as the cause, leading the model to not accurately interpret the role of both wires in causing the short circuit.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Highlight the importance of identifying whether an action is necessary or not for the end result. This will help the model properly estimate the level of direct causation.
2. Emphasize a combined, collaborative causation where multiple factors contribute to an outcome. A de-emphasis on single-factor causation may help the model in better understanding prompts like the second example.
3. Improve the model's understanding of the temporal order and its relation to cause and effect. Just because one event followed after another does not necessarily imply the latter event caused the outcome.
4. Consider revising the instructions to have a clearer assessment of conditions where the cause could be fulfilled by one or multiple factors. This could help improve the model's detections for cause-and-effect relationships under multi-factor scenarios, as in the first example.
5. The principle of double effect should be further explained in relation to causation and intentionality to avoid any confusion.

response:
<START> Examine and respond to queries about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result. In scenarios where an action conforms to an expected or regular pattern, don't automatically attribute it as the direct cause. Instead, allocate a greater concentration on unexpected, irregular incidents, particularly when they lead to a specific conclusion due to a combination of several variables.

cur_prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome.

Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend is happy to sell it. Bill makes an offer, but his friend insists on him not paying so much. Finally, Bill buys the right-side Bartlett bookend from his friend and goes home. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Step by step analysis of the wrong example:

1. Setting up Analysis: The prompt asks to analyze and answer questions about causation, intentionality, and to evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. It emphasizes understanding actors' initial intent and the final result of actions and recognizing expected patterns, irregular events, unforeseen outcomes, and causal links. In this regard, the prompt adequately sets up the context for the system's analysis. 

2. Misinterpretation of Actions and Situation: However, in the example, the AI seems to have been confused about the roles and contributions of the different actors - Bill and Sue, and perhaps disregarded the causal links. It incorrectly evaluated the situation, leading to incorrect judgment. 

3. Incorrect Evaluation: The AI's incorrect evaluation stems from its inability to identify the direct and indirect roles of both Bill and Sue in buying the pair of bookends and their intentionality behind their actions. Despite Bill not being Sue's agent in this instance, his actions inadvertently resulted in the pair of bookends being completed. Hence, he did indirectly cause them to have the paired set of bookends.

4. Impact of Ambiguity: Despite the prompt advising to make assessments of likely motives behind actions, the AI didn’t correctly determine Bill's intention or consider the unintentional result of his action. This suggests that ambiguity in scenarios might derail the AI from the primary task.

Recommendations for improvement:

1. Enhance Interpretation: The system should be better instructed to analyze the interaction and roles of multiple actors and their impact on outcomes. 

2. Weigh Consequences: Guidance could be included about weighing the consequences of actions, even when they are not directly related to the outcome or the actor's primary goal.

3. Ambiguity Handling: The instructions should emphasize dealing with ambiguous scenarios and unintended outcomes, irrespective of the actor's initial intent.

4. Context Understanding: The instruction should be improved on understanding the broader context of the situation to bring out the underlying causal links and indirect causes. In the example, Bill’s decision was independent of Sue’s. However, the series of events resulted in their combined possession of the bookends. The system should focus on these interlinks.

5. Simplify Instructions: The prompt could be simplified to enhance the system's comprehension, thereby reducing potential confusion or misinterpretation.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Deduce and answer questions related to causation and intent behind actions. Examine both the immediate and ripple effects of actions. An action can be considered intentional if the actor knew it could yield a specific outcome, even if that wasn't their primary objective. Acknowledge the divergence between the actor's initial plan and the final result, especially in scenarios where the outcome veers from the original intention. When an action conforms to a predictable pattern, it doesn't necessarily denote a direct causal relation. Place greater emphasis on irregular, unforeseen events that potentially cause a specific effect due to the intersection of various factors. For the study of causation, be sure to distinguish between actors whose actions significantly influence the outcome and those whose roles are more ancillary. Consideration should also be given to differentiating primary outcomes from secondary effects to accurately infer intentionality. 'Intention' and 'cause' should be scrutinized from multiple angles - both narrowly and broadly - to avoid overemphasis on conventional happenings. Apply the double effect principle to differentiate between primary and secondary effects of actions. Where scenarios appear ambiguous, and 'intent' or 'causality' are uncertain, resort to common sense, consensus view, or consider the context that may clarify the actor’s motive. Be mindful to evaluate the possible intent behind an action as it could shed light on significant nuances. <END>

Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed.

Analysis:

<1> In this situation, the model considers the black wire touching the battery as the cause of the short circuit. However, the prompt specifies that in cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. The expected pattern here was that the black wire should touch the battery, so its touching the battery wasn't the direct cause of the short circuit. The cause was the red and black wires touching the battery at the same time. The model may have had trouble discerning the specificity of the roles the black and red wires play in the setup.

<2> Here, the model views the simultaneous action of all researchers turning on their lamps as the cause, not only Jim's action. However, the scenario specified that Jim wasn't supposed to turn his lamp on Thursdays and he did, causing the breaker to fail. Even if Jim's turning on his lamp was part of a group action, it can be viewed as the trigger or direct cause because Jim violated the established pattern – he wasn't supposed to turn on his lamp on Thursday. The model made a mistake by not taking Jim's unique situation - his specific restriction - into account.

Improvements:

1. Make it clear that single events within a chain of causation can still be considered a direct cause, especially if they are contrary to what's established or expected.

2. The prompt should emphasize that when evaluating scenarios with multiple actors or factors, each individual action that contributes to the outcome must be evaluated separately in order to determine its role in the causation.

3. It should also guide the model to weigh norm-breaking events heavily during evaluation.

4. The model should recognize specific contextual elements that mark the difference between what's common or expected and what's not.

5. The prompt can further clarify the difference between procedural actions and those that directly affect the outcome. 

6. The model should better interpret and apply the principle of double effect in evaluation. 

7. Strengthen its ability to handle ambiguous scenarios where intentionality or cause is unclear, by encouraging it to consider norm-breaking actions as potentially causative, not just commonly accepted viewpoints. 

8. It should further innstruct the model to make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions because context can be crucial, especially in scenarios involving rules or norms that are broken.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome. In cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint. Make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions as it could provide crucial context to the actor's intent.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?

(A) Yes
(B) No

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze and discern causation and intentionality. Differentiate between the direct and indirect consequences of actions. Keep in mind that if an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, even if it's not the primary goal, it can be perceived as intentional if it results in that outcome. Consider the variance between initial intention and the final outcome in situations where the initial plan doesn't culminate in the intended result. In scenarios where actions align with a recurring or expected pattern, such actions should not necessarily be branded as the sole cause. Place more emphasis on unexpected and irregular events, particularly when they lead to specific results as a fusion of multiple elements. When investigating causation, distinguish between actors whose actions shape the outcome directly and those whose actions are merely procedural or fitting into established norms. Particular attention should be paid to the actions that deviate from the norm. Study primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Cautiously evaluate the concepts of 'intent' and 'cause', ensuring that the significance of routine happenings is not overly magnified. Invoke the principle of double effect, where primary and secondary effects of actions are demarcated. In ambiguous scenarios where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is debatable, alongside utilizing common sense or the majority viewpoint, pay particular heed to norm-deviating actions. Assess the prospective motives behind actions thoroughly, as these may provide a crucial standpoint to the actor's intent. <END>

cur_prompt: Examine and respond to queries about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result. In scenarios where an action conforms to an expected or regular pattern, don't automatically attribute it as the direct cause. Instead, allocate a greater concentration on unexpected, irregular incidents, particularly when they lead to a specific conclusion due to a combination of several variables. Within the context of causality, distinguish between actors whose actions directly impact the result, and those which were simply part of a procedure. Consider actions that were absolutely necessary for the outcome to materialize and actions that weren't, in order to accurately measure the actor's intention. Evaluate the concepts of 'intention' and 'cause' through both narrow and broad filters, but avoid over-emphasizing routine occurrences. Apply the principle of double effect, differentiating between actions with multiple effects. Use logical reasoning or the majority viewpoint in ambiguous situations where 'intention' or 'cause' is blurred. Concentrate on the plausible motivations behind actions as it can provide useful context to gain a deeper appreciation of the actor's intent. Assess causation and intentionality, bearing in mind that outcomes can be a result of a collaboration of causes rather than a single cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's action of spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that he can only win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green as expected, both conditions for winning were met. Therefore, the outcome of Alex winning the game was a result of a combination of factors (rolling a 12 and the spinner landing on green), rather than solely the result of his spinning the spinner.

Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend tells him it's a precious heirloom and he can't part with it. Bill waits until later when his friend is in the bathroom, and slips the bookend into his bag. Finally, Bill leaves his friend's house with the stolen right-side Bartlett bookend in his bag. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?

gradient:
<1> 
Step by step analysis:
- The query asked whether Alex spinning caused him to win the game.
- In the provided scenario, both conditions (rolling over 2 and spinner landing on green) needed to win were achieved.
- Based on the prompt, the model takes a very detailed and nuanced view about causation and intentionality.
- The model correctly identifies that both conditions were necessary for Alex winning. However, it interprets this as implying the lack of a single direct cause, leading it to select the wrong answer.

Reason for wrong answer:
- While the prompt calls for the consideration of multiple factors leading to an outcome, it doesn't sufficiently clarify how to assess situations where every factor is a necessary condition for the outcome.

<2> 
Step by step analysis:
- The query asked whether Bill caused them to possess the paired set of bookends.
- In the provided scenario, Bill steals his friend's bookend which pairs with the one his wife bought.
- Based on the prompt, the model is meant to assess causality and intentionality, among other factors.
- There is an error in the model's response, where the answer format is not correctly followed.

Reason for wrong answer:
- Format error made by the model, the prompts states to put the single letter correct option within the answer brackets but the model has put "Yes" there.

Ways to improve the prompt:
1. Improvement in clarity: It could clarify how the model should handle situations where every action meets a necessary condition towards the outcome. This might prevent misunderstanding like in example 1. It should make explicit that an action can be a cause even if it isn't the only prerequisite for an outcome.
2. Format guidance: Instructions related to correct formatting of the answer should be re-emphasized or made clearer to avoid mistakes like those made in example 2.

Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's action of spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that he can only win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green as expected, both conditions for winning were met. Therefore, the outcome of Alex winning the game was a result of a combination of factors (rolling a 12 and the spinner landing on green), rather than solely the result of his spinning the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

Examine and respond to queries about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result. In scenarios where an action conforms to an expected or regular pattern, don't automatically attribute it as the direct cause. Instead, allocate a greater concentration on unexpected, irregular incidents, particularly when they lead to a specific conclusion due to a combination of several variables. Within the context of causality, distinguish between actors whose actions directly impact the result, and those which were simply part of a procedure. Consider actions that were absolutely necessary for the outcome to materialize and actions that weren't, in order to accurately measure the actor's intention. Evaluate the concepts of 'intention' and 'cause' through both narrow and broad filters, but avoid over-emphasizing routine occurrences. Apply the principle of double effect, differentiating between actions with multiple effects. Use logical reasoning or the majority viewpoint in ambiguous situations where 'intention' or 'cause' is blurred. Concentrate on the plausible motivations behind actions as it can provide useful context to gain a deeper appreciation of the actor's intent. Assess causation and intentionality, bearing in mind that outcomes can be a result of a collaboration of causes rather than a single cause.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Bill's wife, Sue, is out of town for the weekend. She leaves Bill a message that says, 'I just saw this marvelous bookend. It's called a Bartlett bookend. So pretty! I'm going to go back tomorrow and get one. It will be perfect for the left side of our bookshelf'. Bill goes and visits his friend. Bill and his friend talk for a while, and when Bill asks if his friend is willing to sell the bookend, his friend tells him it's a precious heirloom and he can't part with it. Bill waits until later when his friend is in the bathroom, and slips the bookend into his bag. Finally, Bill leaves his friend's house with the stolen right-side Bartlett bookend in his bag. Then the next day, Sue goes and buys the left-side Bartlett bookend. So, when Sue got home, they had the paired set of bookends. Did Bill cause them to possess the paired set of bookends?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Bill did cause them to possess the paired set of bookends. (A) <answer>Yes</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: N/A: Format error.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Step by step analysis:
- The query asked whether Alex spinning caused him to win the game.
- In the provided scenario, both conditions (rolling over 2 and spinner landing on green) needed to win were achieved.
- Based on the prompt, the model takes a very detailed and nuanced view about causation and intentionality.
- The model correctly identifies that both conditions were necessary for Alex winning. However, it interprets this as implying the lack of a single direct cause, leading it to select the wrong answer.

Reason for wrong answer:
- While the prompt calls for the consideration of multiple factors leading to an outcome, it doesn't sufficiently clarify how to assess situations where every factor is a necessary condition for the outcome.

<2> 
Step by step analysis:
- The query asked whether Bill caused them to possess the paired set of bookends.
- In the provided scenario, Bill steals his friend's bookend which pairs with the one his wife bought.
- Based on the prompt, the model is meant to assess causality and intentionality, among other factors.
- There is an error in the model's response, where the answer format is not correctly followed.

Reason for wrong answer:
- Format error made by the model, the prompts states to put the single letter correct option within the answer brackets but the model has put "Yes" there.

Ways to improve the prompt:
1. Improvement in clarity: It could clarify how the model should handle situations where every action meets a necessary condition towards the outcome. This might prevent misunderstanding like in example 1. It should make explicit that an action can be a cause even if it isn't the only prerequisite for an outcome.
2. Format guidance: Instructions related to correct formatting of the answer should be re-emphasized or made clearer to avoid mistakes like those made in example 2.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome. In cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint. Make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions as it could provide crucial context to the actor's intent.

If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result.

response:
<START> 
Analyze and respond to questions related to causation and intentionality, considering both primary and secondary outcomes. Evaluate actions in a way that, if a predictable result comes about and the actor was aware of such predictability beforehand, view it as intentional—even if the primary goal varied. Pay attention to situations where the initial plan transforms drastically, differing from the achieved result. Apply balanced judgment in cases where an action aligns with an anticipated or routine pattern, holding back from attributing it as the immediate cause. Assign more weight to unexpected areas leading to significant outcomes, primarily when they are the synthesis of multiple variables. In the realm of causation, separate actions that deal direct contribution to a result and those which were merely procedural. When assessing, differentiate between actions that were fundamental for the outcome and actions that only played a minor or no role, to gauge intentionality accurately. Apply a nuanced interpretation of 'intention' and 'cause', navigating through both narrow and extensive perspectives, ensuring typical events are not excessively exaggerated. Implement the rule of double effect, distinguishing between actions leading to multiple outcomes. Uncertain situations having blurred lines between 'intention' and 'cause', should be dealt by embracing logical reasoning or the consensus viewpoint. Place a high focus on possible motivations behind actions as context helps in deep understanding of the actor's intent. Keep in mind, causation and intentionality assessment should recognize that outcomes stem from a collection of causes, not just a single catalyst. When concluding the answers, ensure to answer as per format: present the letter option that correctly answers the question between <answer> and </answer> without including any additional text.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

(A) Yes

The model's response is:

The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Answer: The correct answer is No (B), but the model predicted Yes (A).

Reasoning: The model failed to adhere to the prompt's rules about examining primary and secondary effects of actions in this situation. Even though David did change the temperature setting, it was stated initially that the machine would dry the clothes in sixty minutes if either (not both) the cycle was set to MAX DRY or the temperature was set to HIGH. Thus, since the dryer was already set to MAX DRY, David's change to the temperature setting was not the cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes. The model's mistake comes from not distinguishing correctly between the actions that were absolutely necessary (the MAX DRY setting) for the outcome and those that weren't (the change to HIGH temperature).

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

Answer: The correct answer is No (B), but the model predicted Yes (A).

Reasoning: The specific context was not completely taken into account by the model—while the pharmacist did sign off, the drug wouldn't have been administered if the attending doctor hadn't signed off as well. The policy indicates that decision is primarily on the doctor's shoulders, hence it was the doctor's decision, not the pharmacist's, that caused the drug administration to the patient. Furthermore, it was not inevitable that the pharmacist's sign-off would lead to the patient's recovery. From the perspective of causation, the model does not adequately distinguish between actions that had a direct impact on the result (the doctor's decision), and ones that were part of procedure (the pharmacist's decision).

For Both Examples: 

Reasons: 
1. The model fails to effectively evaluate the critical dependencies in the scenarios and to differentiate the actions that had a direct impact on the result from those that were simply part of a procedure.
2. It appears to have problems accurately measuring the actor's intention.
3. It fails to take into account the specified conditions that must be satisfied for an event to occur, which results in a failure to recognize unnecessary actions. 
4. It does not effectively prioritize unexpected, irregular incidents over regular patterns.
5. Misinterpreting the scenarios causes inappropriate deductions, leading to wrong answers. 

To improve the prompt:
1. Include explicit instructions for the model to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of conditions for an event to occur.
2. Emphasize on effectively distinguishing between actions that directly impact the outcome and those that are part of the procedure.
3. Specifically instruct the model to evaluate each actor's intention and role in the causal chain.
4. Ask the model to deeply analyze the plausible motivations behind actions and the related context.
5. Encourage the model to distinguish between direct and indirect causes, as well as primary and secondary causes.
6. Provide explicit guidance to evaluate actions through the lens of common sense, from both narrow and broad perspectives. 
7. Ask the model to contextualize the events and actions within the larger narrative rather than making isolated judgments.

Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, the pharmacist's decision caused the patient's recovery. <answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

Answer: The correct answer is No (B), but the model predicted Yes (A).

Reasoning: The model failed to adhere to the prompt's rules about examining primary and secondary effects of actions in this situation. Even though David did change the temperature setting, it was stated initially that the machine would dry the clothes in sixty minutes if either (not both) the cycle was set to MAX DRY or the temperature was set to HIGH. Thus, since the dryer was already set to MAX DRY, David's change to the temperature setting was not the cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes. The model's mistake comes from not distinguishing correctly between the actions that were absolutely necessary (the MAX DRY setting) for the outcome and those that weren't (the change to HIGH temperature).

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?

Answer: The correct answer is No (B), but the model predicted Yes (A).

Reasoning: The specific context was not completely taken into account by the model—while the pharmacist did sign off, the drug wouldn't have been administered if the attending doctor hadn't signed off as well. The policy indicates that decision is primarily on the doctor's shoulders, hence it was the doctor's decision, not the pharmacist's, that caused the drug administration to the patient. Furthermore, it was not inevitable that the pharmacist's sign-off would lead to the patient's recovery. From the perspective of causation, the model does not adequately distinguish between actions that had a direct impact on the result (the doctor's decision), and ones that were part of procedure (the pharmacist's decision).

For Both Examples: 

Reasons: 
1. The model fails to effectively evaluate the critical dependencies in the scenarios and to differentiate the actions that had a direct impact on the result from those that were simply part of a procedure.
2. It appears to have problems accurately measuring the actor's intention.
3. It fails to take into account the specified conditions that must be satisfied for an event to occur, which results in a failure to recognize unnecessary actions. 
4. It does not effectively prioritize unexpected, irregular incidents over regular patterns.
5. Misinterpreting the scenarios causes inappropriate deductions, leading to wrong answers. 

To improve the prompt:
1. Include explicit instructions for the model to evaluate the necessity and sufficiency of conditions for an event to occur.
2. Emphasize on effectively distinguishing between actions that directly impact the outcome and those that are part of the procedure.
3. Specifically instruct the model to evaluate each actor's intention and role in the causal chain.
4. Ask the model to deeply analyze the plausible motivations behind actions and the related context.
5. Encourage the model to distinguish between direct and indirect causes, as well as primary and secondary causes.
6. Provide explicit guidance to evaluate actions through the lens of common sense, from both narrow and broad perspectives. 
7. Ask the model to contextualize the events and actions within the larger narrative rather than making isolated judgments.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome. In cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint. Make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions as it could provide crucial context to the actor's intent.
(4) Examine and respond to queries about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result. In scenarios where an action conforms to an expected or regular pattern, don't automatically attribute it as the direct cause. Instead, allocate a greater concentration on unexpected, irregular incidents, particularly when they lead to a specific conclusion due to a combination of several variables. Within the context of causality, distinguish between actors whose actions directly impact the result, and those which were simply part of a procedure. Consider actions that were absolutely necessary for the outcome to materialize and actions that weren't, in order to accurately measure the actor's intention. Evaluate the concepts of 'intention' and 'cause' through both narrow and broad filters, but avoid over-emphasizing routine occurrences. Apply the principle of double effect, differentiating between actions with multiple effects. Use logical reasoning or the majority viewpoint in ambiguous situations where 'intention' or 'cause' is blurred. Concentrate on the plausible motivations behind actions as it can provide useful context to gain a deeper appreciation of the actor's intent. Assess causation and intentionality, bearing in mind that outcomes can be a result of a collaboration of causes rather than a single cause.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The cause of the circuit breaker failing was the combination of all three people turning on their lamps at the same time. Jim's action alone did not directly lead to the failure of the circuit breaker.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Model's response: No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. The cause of the circuit breaker failing was the combination of all three people turning on their lamps at the same time. Jim's action alone did not directly lead to the failure of the circuit breaker.
Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: B

In this case, the problem seems to be the following:

1. The model has been told to not automatically ascribe a predictable outcome to an action if that action is part of an expected pattern. In this case, however, the 'pattern' is conditional upon the collective actions of three individuals—including Jim—using power simultaneously, which then results in the power outage. Here, the model mistakenly interpreted the regular pattern of electricity use (where each person has allocated days) as an overriding factor without considering that even within this pattern, specific actions do have significant, predictable outcomes.

2. The prompt asks the model to differentiate between actions that were necessary for the outcome to occur and those that were not, and to consider this when measuring an actor's intention. However, the model incorrectly weighed Jim's actions as not necessary for the outcome - the circuit breaker failing. The model failed to see that Jim's action, despite not being the sole cause, was indeed a necessary part of the chain of events leading to the breaker's failure.

3. The principle of causality has not been efficiently applied by the model here. The complexity of the causation here is not recognizing the importance of each individual's action and how they combine to create the end result. 

4. The prompt instructs the model to differentiate between 'direct' and 'indirect' causation, likely leading the model to incorrectly reason that since other actors are involved, no single actor could be a 'direct' cause. 

To improve the prompt, the following aspects can be considered:

1. Clarity on Multifaceted Causation: Improve instructions on handling situations where multiple actors contribute to an outcome, including redefining the concept of 'direct' causation in multi-actor scenarios.

2. Necessary Part of Outcome: Clarify that an actor's contribution to an outcome can be seen as a 'cause', even if the individual's intention was not directly aimed at that outcome, particularly when that individual's action is a necessary condition for the outcome.

3. Clarification on Pattern: Re-address the instructions on 'patterns' and 'expected outcomes', emphasizing that the occurrence of expected reactions to a stimulus should not be used to absolve contributors from their part in creating the outcome.

4. Amplify the Principle of Double Effect: Ensure the principle is applied when actions achieve pre-known or predictable secondary objectives, even if these are not the 'primary' aim of said actions.

By doing so, the model's understanding and application of causality, intentionality, and effect can be refined.

Evaluate the concepts of 'intention' and 'cause' through both narrow and broad filters, but avoid over-emphasizing routine occurrences. Apply the principle of double effect, differentiating between actions with multiple effects. Use logical reasoning or the majority viewpoint in ambiguous situations where 'intention' or 'cause' is blurred. Concentrate on the plausible motivations behind actions as it can provide useful context to gain a deeper appreciation of the actor's intent. Assess causation and intentionality, bearing in mind that outcomes can be a result of a collaboration of causes rather than a single cause.

response:
<START>

Analyze and address questions about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. Should an actor be aware of a predictable consequence, attribute it as intentional if that consequence is the outcome—even if it wasn't the actor's main objective. Be aware of cases where the initial intention varies from the final outcome, and take this variance into account. Avoid stereotyping an action that aligns with an expected or regular pattern as the direct cause right away. Instead, intensify the scrutiny on uncertain, uncommon incidents that converge to a specific end through a mixture of various factors. When examining causality, make a distinct separation between actors whose actions have an immediate impact on the outcome, and those which formed just part of a process. Evaluate the necessity and irrelevance of certain actions towards the final outcome to precisely measure the actor's intent. Look into the concepts of 'intent' and 'cause' through a strict as well as a comprehensive lens, steering clear from overemphasizing routine activities. Implement the principle of double effect to differentiate between actions with primary and secondary consequences. In ambiguous situations where there's a blur between 'intent' and 'cause', resort to logical reasoning or the consensus. Pay extra attention to plausible motivations behind actions, as this could offer valuable context to better understand the actor's intent. In assessing causality, acknowledge that outcomes could be driven by multiple causes instead of a single direct cause. In scenarios involving multiple actors contributing to an outcome, consider each actor's action as an essential link in the chain of causation. When actions serve as necessary conditions for an outcome to occur, even if they are not the sole cause, consider such actions as part of causal factors.

cur_prompt: Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. While the drug may have contributed to the patient's recovery, it was ultimately the patient's own body's response to the drug that led to the positive outcome. The attending doctor's decision to go against hospital policy and sign off on the drug may have indirectly contributed to the patient's recovery by allowing the drug to be administered, but it was not the direct cause of the recovery.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Error Analysis:

In example <1>, the model appears to have misapplied principles of causality and intentionality. While the statement that the patient's recovery was a result of their body's response to the drug is fundamentally true, it omits the reality that this response was made possible by distinct chain of events that were initiated by the decisions of both the intern and the attending doctor. 

The error in the model's response is that it seems to prioritize physiological causality (the patient's recovery was due to their bodily response) but ignores the organizational, operational, or human factors that enabled this physiological response (the doctor's and intern's decisions to administer the drug). This is an example of myopic analysis where the focus is on immediate physical cause-effect relationships, while systemic and human factors are not given due importance.

Perhaps due to the complexity of the scenario, the model did not follow the directions of the prompt to: "turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome". In this case, the doctor's decision (against hospital policy and ignoring potential side effects) was arguably unexpected and irregular.

2. Improvements:

- The prompt could be more explicit in its instructions about looking at the chain of causality and not just focusing on the immediate physical causality. By chain of causality, it should motivate to consider personal decisions and actions as additional causes, not mere facilitators of a cause.

- The prompt also needs to have clearer instruction on weighing all factors of a cause and on how to decide what contributes to an outcome. Adding instructions on assessing the weight and influence of individual actions in the narrative could provide more definitive guidance.

- Had the prompt clarified that 'cause' also includes 'authority's decision' or 'permission', the model could have picked that up and associated the doctor's decision with the cause.

- The prompt could clarify more on the part of handling exceptions against the rules (like hospital policy in this case). Decision making against standard policies should be considered as direct cause, no matter what the outcome is.

- There should be some instruction regarding the human factors in causality. In many cases like this one, human decisions play a critical, 'cause' level role, not just 'effect' level. The model should be guided to recognize and understand the same.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, as David changing the temperature setting to HIGH directly led to his clothes drying in sixty minutes. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie won the $100 bet because he made the 3-point shot at the buzzer, not because he made the layup at the beginning of the game. The direct cause of him winning the bet was the 3-point shot he made at the end. The layup he made at the beginning of the game was not the direct cause of him winning the bet, as he could have still won the bet by making a 3-point shot only. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer this question as follows:

No, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not because Wayne did not change the position of the device. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example #1: 

Incorrect Explanation: The model incorrectly determines that David's changing the temperature setting to HIGH directly caused his clothes to dry in 60 minutes. An error has occurred because the model has not adequately considered that David's clothes would dry in 60 minutes even when the temperature was not set to HIGH as long as the cycle was set to MAX DRY.

Root problem: The model isn't focusing effectively on redundant or unnecessary actions. The major cause was already sufficient (MAX DRY setting), the action of setting the temperature on HIGH did not matter. Therefore, the prompt is ineffective in guiding the model to accurately distinguish between direct and indirect consequences and dismiss unnecessary actions.

Example #2: 

Incorrect Explanation: Despite the fact that Louie making a layup was sufficient for him to win the bet, the model attributes his win to the three-point shot he made at the buzzer. 

Root Problem: The model applied the recency effect and assumed the post facto action (3-point shot) to be the cause of the effect, however, the bet was already won with the layup Louie made. Here, the prompt's mention of considering multiple factors while assessing cause and effect may have caused confusion in sequence-related scenarios like this.

Example #3: 

Incorrect Explanation: The model inaccurately assumes that Wayne checking the position of the device did not have any impact on the device getting charged, whereas the model should have identified Wayne's inaction as a factor because his decision to leave the device on the pad contributed to the device being fully charged.

Root problem: The model failed to consider inaction as a cause. Merely because Wayne did not physically 'do' something, doesn't mean it had no significance. Quite the opposite, by leaving things as they are, he indirectly caused the device to charge fully.

Considerations for improving the prompt:
1. The model should consider whether an action is necessary in order for an outcome to happen.
2. Reinforce the instruction to consider actions that singularly produce a result.
3. Add stipulations to consider the temporal order of actions and causes.
4. Add clarifying instructions about the contribution of 'inaction.' Non-action can also be crucial.
5. Enhance the consideration of the sequence of actions/events when judging cause and effect.
6. Adjust prompts to ensure that the model doesn't over-consider routine actions or the recency of actions as causal reasons.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary.

But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.

<START> Apply analytical thinking to distinguish between actions in a given scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. Assess each action individually, by closely evaluating its direct and indirect consequences. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' in both a strict and a broad sense. Keep in mind that awareness of a possible outcome from an action doesn't automatically mean that the actor intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary intention. Be particularly cautious about actions that conform to an expected outcome or pattern; such actions may not necessarily be the direct cause. Focus more on unexpected or irregular events where multiple contributing elements converge to produce a specific result. In delving into cause-effect relationships, consider the sequence and timing of events, and the relevance of actions that singularly lead to the same outcome. At the same time, be discerning about the outcomes of actions that were superfluous or unnecessary, if an effect could have been produced without the action, it may not be a true cause. Be mindful of the role of inaction and the potential causal contribution of deciding not to intervene or change a situation. Apply common-sense judgement or fall back on the majority consensus when there's ambiguity around discerning intentionality or causality. Exercise caution in attributing a routine action as the primary cause for an outcome, particularly when an unexpected outcome arises. Focus more on the irregularities rather than the familiar patterns when discerning causality. <END>

Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To analyze this scenario, we need to consider the actions taken by Louie and their consequences. Louie made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game, fulfilling one of the conditions for winning the bet. He then made a layup at the end of the game, fulfilling the other condition. Therefore, Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

1) Question: 
Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

Reviewed Model Answer: 
To analyze this scenario, we need to consider the actions taken by Louie and their consequences. Louie made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game, fulfilling one of the conditions for winning the bet. He then made a layup at the end of the game, fulfilling the other condition. Therefore, Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

Analysis:
The model’s analysis of Louie's actions and their consequences seems superficial, focusing on the layup as the action that enabled him to win the bet. The prompt instructions state to "evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately." However, the model has failed to correctly identify that Louie's first 3-point shot was the action that directly led to his winning of the bet. The layup, despite being an action performed by Louie, was not necessary and did not cause the bet win, as per the given conditions. Louie would have still won the bet even if he didn't make the layup, so it actually doesn't have a direct consequential relationship with the bet outcome.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
- The model failed to recognize that Louie fulfilled the condition to win the bet with his first 3-point shot, regardless of the subsequent layup.
- The model failed to discern that the instruction in the prompt to disregard outcomes of actions that were unnecessary applies to the layup in this scenario.
- The model possibly misinterpreted the instructions in the prompt regarding judging "intentionality" and "cause," leading it to wrongly connect the layup with the bet outcome.

Improvements for the prompt:
- Clarity on evaluating separate consequences: The prompt could highlight the need to evaluate whether an action was indeed necessary to cause an outcome. The importance of the relative sequence of actions or events might also be emphasized.
- Overspecificity and ambiguity: The language of the prompt might be too winding and dense for the model to parse clearly. Simplifying language and shortening sentences could help.
- Bias towards the end of scenarios: The prompt could include a guideline to avoid bias towards actions occurring later in sequences or scenarios.
- More explicit guidance about discerning necessary and sufficient conditions: The prompt could better define and stress the concept of 'necessary and sufficient conditions' in causal attributions. It's crucial to understand that an action can only be considered a cause if it was necessary to bring about the outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution.

In this task, conscientiously evaluate each action and the direct and indirect consequences arising from it. When pondering 'intentionality' and 'cause', treat them both in narrow and wide aspects. Be mindful that even if an individual is aware of a possible outcome of an action, it doesn't necessarily imply they intended for that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their prime aim. Pay careful attention to unexpected or anomalous events - where various factors converge to yield a unique outcome - instead of actions that align with expected outcomes. While probing cause and effect, focus on those elements which individually would lead to the same effect and brush aside outcomes from actions that are superfluous. In cases where there is ambiguity and confusion, employ pragmatic reasoning or consider the consensus when determining intentionality or causality. Specifically remember, that the occurrence of unusual outcomes from routine actions doesn't instantaneously signify that the customary action is the principal cause. Also, avoid chronological bias in examining actions, just because an action happened later in the sequence doesn't mean it has more causal significance.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman was aware that the plan to rob the bank would result in harm to the health of the townspeople, as he knew about the neurotoxin and its effects on the water supply. Despite this knowledge, Bob's primary goal was to steal money, not to harm the townspeople directly. However, by choosing to proceed with the plan despite knowing the potential consequences, Bob can be seen as intentionally causing harm to the health of the townspeople.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

The question in the first scenario deals with the concept of intentionality. Bob is aware that his actions would harm the townspeople, but his primary goal was to steal money. The prompt asks the model to "recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal." However, the confusion could stem from where the prompt says, "Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions, or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone." The model may have taken this to mean the overall implications of Bob's actions and concluded that he intentionally harmed the townspeople because of his decision to continue with the plan, despite knowing the far-reaching impacts. 


Example 2:

In the second scenario, the question tests the understanding of causality. The machine shorts because both the black and red wires touch the battery at the same time. The prompt says, "In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result." Here, the model misinterpreted the instruction. Neither the black wire nor the red wire alone can cause the machine to short circuit. They both need to touch the battery at the same time. However, the model treated the black wire's touch as the cause. 

Improving the Prompt:

Based on the analysis of the two examples, there are several areas where the prompt could be improved:

1. Intentionality: The prompt should more accurately reflect the definition of intentionality. Intent can't be established solely based on the knowledge about the outcome. In Example 1, Bob doesn't have an intent to harm the townspeople; his intent is to rob the bank.

2. Cause & Effect: Clarity needs to be added to the prompt to reflect that the contributing factors need to be considered. A single action shouldn't be labeled as the cause when outcomes are a result of multiple actions together, as seen in Example 2.

3. Joint Responsibility: The prompt should include guidance to differentiate between joint causality and individual causality. The model may attribute causality to only one factor even if multiple factors have worked together to cause the outcome.

4. Common Sense Reasoning: Encourage better usage of "common sense" when discerning causality in ambiguous situations. 

5. Better defining 'necessary' actions: An action might be part of the sequence leading to an outcome, but might not be essential in bringing about that outcome. This needs better elaboration.

By modifying these aspects, the language model will be better equipped to correctly analyze scenarios and answer questions related to causal attribution.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman was aware that the plan to rob the bank would result in harm to the health of the townspeople, as he knew about the neurotoxin and its effects on the water supply. Despite this knowledge, Bob's primary goal was to steal money, not to harm the townspeople directly. However, by choosing to proceed with the plan despite knowing the potential consequences, Bob can be seen as intentionally causing harm to the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes, the fact that the black wire touched the battery caused the machine to short circuit. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

The question in the first scenario deals with the concept of intentionality. Bob is aware that his actions would harm the townspeople, but his primary goal was to steal money. The prompt asks the model to "recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal." However, the confusion could stem from where the prompt says, "Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions, or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone." The model may have taken this to mean the overall implications of Bob's actions and concluded that he intentionally harmed the townspeople because of his decision to continue with the plan, despite knowing the far-reaching impacts. 


Example 2:

In the second scenario, the question tests the understanding of causality. The machine shorts because both the black and red wires touch the battery at the same time. The prompt says, "In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result." Here, the model misinterpreted the instruction. Neither the black wire nor the red wire alone can cause the machine to short circuit. They both need to touch the battery at the same time. However, the model treated the black wire's touch as the cause. 

Improving the Prompt:

Based on the analysis of the two examples, there are several areas where the prompt could be improved:

1. Intentionality: The prompt should more accurately reflect the definition of intentionality. Intent can't be established solely based on the knowledge about the outcome. In Example 1, Bob doesn't have an intent to harm the townspeople; his intent is to rob the bank.

2. Cause & Effect: Clarity needs to be added to the prompt to reflect that the contributing factors need to be considered. A single action shouldn't be labeled as the cause when outcomes are a result of multiple actions together, as seen in Example 2.

3. Joint Responsibility: The prompt should include guidance to differentiate between joint causality and individual causality. The model may attribute causality to only one factor even if multiple factors have worked together to cause the outcome.

4. Common Sense Reasoning: Encourage better usage of "common sense" when discerning causality in ambiguous situations. 

5. Better defining 'necessary' actions: An action might be part of the sequence leading to an outcome, but might not be essential in bringing about that outcome. This needs better elaboration.

By modifying these aspects, the language model will be better equipped to correctly analyze scenarios and answer questions related to causal attribution.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.
(4) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal.

response:
<START> Examine a scenario and differentiate among diverse actions to answer questions about cause-and-effect and intent. Each action, both direct and indirect, should be assessed distinctly for its immediate and ripple effects. Recognize that 'intentionality' and 'cause' can be understood in both tight (pertaining to immediate impacts) and broad (incorporating systemic factors and human involvement) contexts. Bear in mind that simply because an actor is aware that their action could potentially result in a certain outcome, it does not inherently mean they intentionally brought about the outcome, especially when it was not their main objective. Steer clear from simplistically attribiting cause to an isolated action or the final action in a sequence; multiple actions, permissions or decisions might together culminate in the outcome. Place appropriate emphasis on unexpected or irregular events where various factors interact and lead to a specific result, and examine the role of routine or non-conforming actions as contributory causes without directly correlating them to their frequency or rarity. In the analysis of causality, consider actions that either individually or in combination would generate the same outcome, while dismissing those actions that are not fundamental in reaching that outcome. For judgements pertaining to intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations, rely on logical reasoning and general opinion. It's essential to identify the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors when determining cause, particularly if there is a causation chain involving multiple actions and decisions. Examine the sequence of causation, recognizing both human elements and systemic factors, and apply a discerning lens to differentiate between joint causality and individual causality when both are at play. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Jake desperately wants to have more money. He knows that he will inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But Jake isn't very good at using his rifle. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet hits her directly in the heart. She dies instantly. Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jake's actions suggest that he intended to shoot his aunt, as he raised his rifle, got her in the sights, and pressed the trigger.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's action of spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that he can only win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, he met the conditions to win the game. Therefore, the direct cause of Alex winning the game was the outcome of his dice roll, not his action of spinning the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this case, the model incorrectly assesses the sniper's intentionality. The model fails to distinguish between the sniper's primary and secondary goals. Even though the main goal was to kill the commander, the sniper was also aware that the barrel of his gun would heat up as a direct result of firing the shot. In this context, the heating of the barrel is a direct but unintended consequence of his actions. Even if the sniper doesn't care about the heat, he still knows the outcome prior to his action. The model should not discount unintended but knowingly caused side effects of an action.

<2> 
In this scenario, the center-point problem is "intention." Jake's original intention was to shoot his aunt, he wasn't intending for his hand to slip or for the gun to fire accidentally. Even though he ends up killing his aunt, the action was unintentional because the actual shooting was caused by his hand slipping. The model embraces Jake's intention to harm, and hence attributes the final outcome to Jake's broad intention despite the method of execution being accidental. The model fails in separating accident from intention in this scenario.

<3> 
In the third scenario, the model fails to understand that there are two mutually inclusive conditions for winning the game, either of which is enough for Alex to win. Alex's spinning of the spinner landing on green is one of the two potential causes for the win. Even if the dice roll had resulted in a value less than or equal to 2, Alex still would've won the game because the spinner landed on green. Thus, Alex's spinning action did causally contribute to him winning the game. The model here doesn't sufficiently value the effect of mutually inclusive conditions where either condition can independently lead to the outcome.

In Summary, the prompt can be improved in the following aspects:

1. Highlighting the distinction between primary and secondary outcomes of an action: Just because an outcome wasn't the actor's primary goal doesn't mean it wasn't intentionally caused if the actor was aware it would inevitably occur.

2. Emphasis on Disentangling Accidental Actions from General Intention: Even with a general intention to cause an outcome, accidental actions that bring about this outcome should not be considered intentional.

3. Enhance the understanding of mutually inclusive conditions: The AI needs to understand that in a situation where there are multiple independent pathways to an outcome, each pathway independently contributes to the final outcome.

Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome. Use common sense and the majority opinion to guide your judgement when discerning intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations. Remember, routine or policy-breaking actions should not be ruled out as contributory causes based on their regularity or irregularity alone. Identify roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors in defining cause, especially where there is a chain of causality involving individual actions and decisions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jake desperately wants to have more money. He knows that he will inherit a lot of money when his aunt dies. One day, he sees his aunt walking by the window. He raises his rifle, gets her in the sights, and presses the trigger. But Jake isn't very good at using his rifle. His hand slipped on the barrel of the gun, and a shot went off. Nonetheless, the bullet hits her directly in the heart. She dies instantly. Did Jake shoot his aunt in the heart intentionally?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jake's actions suggest that he intended to shoot his aunt, as he raised his rifle, got her in the sights, and pressed the trigger. However, the fact that his hand slipped on the barrel of the gun and the shot went off unexpectedly complicates the intentionality of the act. Despite the accidental nature of the shot, the outcome was still the direct result of Jake's actions. Therefore, a typical person would likely answer:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's action of spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that he can only win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, he met the conditions to win the game. Therefore, the direct cause of Alex winning the game was the outcome of his dice roll, not his action of spinning the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this case, the model incorrectly assesses the sniper's intentionality. The model fails to distinguish between the sniper's primary and secondary goals. Even though the main goal was to kill the commander, the sniper was also aware that the barrel of his gun would heat up as a direct result of firing the shot. In this context, the heating of the barrel is a direct but unintended consequence of his actions. Even if the sniper doesn't care about the heat, he still knows the outcome prior to his action. The model should not discount unintended but knowingly caused side effects of an action.

<2> 
In this scenario, the center-point problem is "intention." Jake's original intention was to shoot his aunt, he wasn't intending for his hand to slip or for the gun to fire accidentally. Even though he ends up killing his aunt, the action was unintentional because the actual shooting was caused by his hand slipping. The model embraces Jake's intention to harm, and hence attributes the final outcome to Jake's broad intention despite the method of execution being accidental. The model fails in separating accident from intention in this scenario.

<3> 
In the third scenario, the model fails to understand that there are two mutually inclusive conditions for winning the game, either of which is enough for Alex to win. Alex's spinning of the spinner landing on green is one of the two potential causes for the win. Even if the dice roll had resulted in a value less than or equal to 2, Alex still would've won the game because the spinner landed on green. Thus, Alex's spinning action did causally contribute to him winning the game. The model here doesn't sufficiently value the effect of mutually inclusive conditions where either condition can independently lead to the outcome.

In Summary, the prompt can be improved in the following aspects:

1. Highlighting the distinction between primary and secondary outcomes of an action: Just because an outcome wasn't the actor's primary goal doesn't mean it wasn't intentionally caused if the actor was aware it would inevitably occur.

2. Emphasis on Disentangling Accidental Actions from General Intention: Even with a general intention to cause an outcome, accidental actions that bring about this outcome should not be considered intentional.

3. Enhance the understanding of mutually inclusive conditions: The AI needs to understand that in a situation where there are multiple independent pathways to an outcome, each pathway independently contributes to the final outcome.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.
(4) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome. Use common sense and the majority opinion to guide your judgement when discerning intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations.

<START> Analyze and adjudicate upon various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. Distinguish between each action and evaluate their direct and indirect impacts separately. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' must be considered both in a specific context (regarding immediate outcomes) and a broader context (factoring in systemic and personal issues). Understand that if an actor is aware of a certain result that could be an inevitable consequence of their action, they can still be regarded as intentionally causing that result, even if it falls outside their primary objectives. Don’t overlook the compounded effect of successive actions; a sequence of decisions, acts or permissions could collaboratively influence an outcome, rather than the terminal action in isolation. Assign due weightage to unintended but predictable outcomes of an action when interpreting intentionality. Pay close attention to unexpected or irregular events where multiple factors amalgamate leading to an unexpected outcome. In comprehending cause and effect, consider those elements that, either independently or collectively, would lead to the same corollary. Dismiss results of actions that had no crucial role in the realization of an outcome. Be aware of scenarios involving mutually inclusive conditions, and appreciate the causality contributed by each condition independently. Rely on common sense and consensus to guide your judgement in the face of ambiguity regarding intentionality or causality. Do not dismiss routine or exceptional actions as causal contributors based merely on their frequency or infrequency. Identify the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic elements in defining cause, especially where a chain of causality incorporates individual actions and decisions. Disentangle the element of accident from overarching intent in scenarios where the immediate cause of the outcome was unintended.

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's action of spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game dictate that he can only win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green as expected, he met the conditions to win the game. Therefore, the direct cause of Alex winning the game was the outcome of his dice roll, not his action of spinning the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Lack of clear understanding of simultaneous conditions:
   The model mistakenly interpreted the action of spinning as a separate action leading to a different outcome. The conditions for winning the game were set that Alex could win through the dice roll or the spinner result. These conditions operate simultaneously and Alex's actions to fulfill both conditions contributed to his win equally. The AI model didn't fully recognize the concurrent nature of the game rules and therefore, delivered an incorrect response.

2. Overemphasis on dice roll:
   The AI model placed too much emphasis on the dice roll being the primary cause of winning. It disregarded the spinner result as an auxiliary event even though both the dice throw and spinner spin are equally valid game conditions. The model failed to appreciate that the requirements for a win have equal value and each event contributes as a cause to the outcome.

3. Misinterpretation of the prompt's instructions:
   The AI was instructed to 'consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result.' But it neglected the concept of 'collective outcome', focusing on the individual outcome (rolling the dice greater than 2) instead of linking this with the 'collective outcome' (the spinner landing on green and rolling greater than 2).

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Be explicit about simultaneous events: Due to the AI's linear model of cause-and-effect, it may not fully understand or interpret simultaneous conditions appropriately. Therefore, the prompt should be explicit about considering simultaneous conditions or events and how they can equally contribute towards an outcome.

2. Emphasize equal value of conditions: The prompt should elucidate that if the scenarios or game rules provide conditions, these should be evaluated with equal importance unless the scenario explicitly ranks them differently.

3. Clarify 'collective outcome': To mitigate the misinterpretation of 'collective outcome', the instructions should explicitly explain what this term means and to consider all factors that contribute to the overall result. 

4. Consider common-sense general understanding: The prompt could also encourage the model to apply 'common-sense' understanding of situations to assist when the causative sequence or structure in a task is ambiguous. For instance, in this board game, it's a common understanding that both dice roll and spinner result contribute towards the win. 

5. Distinguish between necessary and sufficient causes: The prompt asks the model to "discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome," but it could be interpreted that spinning was unnecessary because the dice roll would have been enough. Making the model consider both necessary and sufficient causes could prevent such misinterpretation.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Answer questions about causal attribution considering both direct and indirect results of actions. Take into account that if an actor is aware that an action will certainly lead to a particular outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that outcome is not the primary goal. Evaluate questions with both strict and broad interpretations of 'intentionality' and 'cause', and consider common sense or prevailing opinion when ambiguity arises in interpretations.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.
(3) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.
(4) Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome. Use common sense and the majority opinion to guide your judgement when discerning intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations. Remember, routine or policy-breaking actions should not be ruled out as contributory causes based on their regularity or irregularity alone. Identify roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors in defining cause, especially where there is a chain of causality involving individual actions and decisions. Analyze the causation chain considering both human and systemic factors.

response:
<START> 
Scrutinize and discern between diverse actions in a given situation to answer queries about causal attribution. Evaluate each singular action and its immediate and indirect consequences independently. Illuminate 'intentionality' and 'cause' from both a narrow perspective (focusing on the immediate impact) and a broad scope (incorporating systemic and human elements). Recognize that an actor being aware of a potential outcome from their action doesn't necessarily imply they intentionally triggered that outcome, particularly when it isn't their primary objective. Also note that simultaneous conditions or actions can hold equal causative value unless explicitly ranked differently by the scenario or game rules. Understand the cumulative impact of a sequence of actions, decisions, or permissions that together can result in an outcome instead of attributing it to the final action alone. Pay detailed attention to unusual or irregular events converging to produce a particular outcome. As you decipher cause and effect links, contemplate those factors that alone or in combination would yield the same result. Do not attribute outcomes to actions that were not necessary in accomplishing the outcome in scenarios where multiple sufficient causes are present. Use common sense and general consensus to steer your judgement when interpreting intentionality or causality in indistinct situations. However, routinely occurring or policy-adverse actions should not be dismissed as potential contributors solely based on their frequency or abnormality. Recognize the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic circumstances in shaping cause, particularly when there is a chain of causality encompassing discrete actions and decisions. Analyze the cause-and-effect chain, integrating human and systemic factors, but also remember to apply a common-sense understanding in situations where causative structures are ambiguous.

   prompt: Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken. Consider every contributing factor, including those that might not directly precede the outcome. Try to envision alternative scenarios: would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur? This can help to pinpoint the true contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are a result of one singular event or cause. In many instances, outcomes are born out of a combination of several factors. Avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. Comprehend the difference between someone/something intentionally causing an outcome or just being part of a sequence of events that led to it.

   prompt: Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome.

   reward: 0.6800 | Q: 0.6800 | uct: 2.7614 | cum_rewards: [0.68]
   prompt: Carefully analyze the given scenarios to ascertain the key events or actions leading to the outcomes. Always consider the timing of events, but do not attribute significance solely based on sequence. Aim to distinguish between actual cause and effect and mere progression of events. Also, differentiate between incidental and deliberate outcomes, keeping in mind that an intentional action may not necessarily impact the resulting outcome. It's crucial to realize that knowingly not avoiding a foreseeable harmful outcome can be seen as intent. Understand that a single event satisfying a requirement for an outcome is often considered a causal factor, even if there are other contributing factors. Engage in thoughtful consideration of all contributing factors, not just those immediately preceding the outcome. Think about what might happen if certain events were modified or didn't occur altogether - would the final outcome still be the same? Keep in mind that not all outcomes arise from a single cause but are often the result of an accumulation of events or factors. Seek to avoid oversimplified causal interpretations. Recognize that an individual or entity may be a part of the sequence of events leading to an outcome without necessarily being the intentional cause. Lastly, make sure to properly consider any given conditions or rules within the scenario that may significantly influence the outcome. Please answer based on these guidelines.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome. In cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint. Make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions as it could provide crucial context to the actor's intent.

If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result. In scenarios where an action conforms to an expected or regular pattern, don't automatically attribute it as the direct cause.

When examining causality, make a distinct separation between actors whose actions have an immediate impact on the outcome, and those which formed just part of a process. Evaluate the necessity and irrelevance of certain actions towards the final outcome to precisely measure the actor's intent. Look into the concepts of 'intent' and 'cause' through a strict as well as a comprehensive lens, steering clear from overemphasizing routine activities. Implement the principle of double effect to differentiate between actions with primary and secondary consequences. In ambiguous situations where there's a blur between 'intent' and 'cause', resort to logical reasoning or the consensus. Pay extra attention to plausible motivations behind actions, as this could offer valuable context to better understand the actor's intent. In assessing causality, acknowledge that outcomes could be driven by multiple causes instead of a single direct cause. In scenarios involving multiple actors contributing to an outcome, consider each actor's action as an essential link in the chain of causation. When actions serve as necessary conditions for an outcome to occur, even if they are not the sole cause, consider such actions as part of causal factors.

   prompt: Deduce and answer questions related to causation and intent behind actions. Examine both the immediate and ripple effects of actions. An action can be considered intentional if the actor knew it could yield a specific outcome, even if that wasn't their primary objective. Acknowledge the divergence between the actor's initial plan and the final result, especially in scenarios where the outcome veers from the original intention. When an action conforms to a predictable pattern, it doesn't necessarily denote a direct causal relation. Place greater emphasis on irregular, unforeseen events that potentially cause a specific effect due to the intersection of various factors. For the study of causation, be sure to distinguish between actors whose actions significantly influence the outcome and those whose roles are more ancillary. Consideration should also be given to differentiating primary outcomes from secondary effects to accurately infer intentionality. 'Intention' and 'cause' should be scrutinized from multiple angles - both narrowly and broadly - to avoid overemphasis on conventional happenings. Apply the double effect principle to differentiate between primary and secondary effects of actions. Where scenarios appear ambiguous, and 'intent' or 'causality' are uncertain, resort to common sense, consensus view, or consider the context that may clarify the actor’s motive. Be mindful to evaluate the possible intent behind an action as it could shed light on significant nuances.

Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause.

   prompt: Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome. Use common sense and the majority opinion to guide your judgement when discerning intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations. Remember, routine or policy-breaking actions should not be ruled out as contributory causes based on their regularity or irregularity alone. Identify roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors in defining cause, especially where there is a chain of causality involving individual actions and decisions. Analyze the causation chain considering both human and systemic factors.

   prompt: Examine a scenario and differentiate among diverse actions to answer questions about cause-and-effect and intent. Each action, both direct and indirect, should be assessed distinctly for its immediate and ripple effects. Recognize that 'intentionality' and 'cause' can be understood in both tight (pertaining to immediate impacts) and broad (incorporating systemic factors and human involvement) contexts. Bear in mind that simply because an actor is aware that their action could potentially result in a certain outcome, it does not inherently mean they intentionally brought about the outcome, especially when it was not their main objective. Steer clear from simplistically attribiting cause to an isolated action or the final action in a sequence; multiple actions, permissions or decisions might together culminate in the outcome. Place appropriate emphasis on unexpected or irregular events where various factors interact and lead to a specific result, and examine the role of routine or non-conforming actions as contributory causes without directly correlating them to their frequency or rarity. In the analysis of causality, consider actions that either individually or in combination would generate the same outcome, while dismissing those actions that are not fundamental in reaching that outcome. For judgements pertaining to intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations, rely on logical reasoning and general opinion. It's essential to identify the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors when determining cause, particularly if there is a causation chain involving multiple actions and decisions. Examine the sequence of causation, recognizing both human elements and systemic factors, and apply a discerning lens to differentiate between joint causality and individual causality when both are at play.

Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.

   prompt: Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome. Use common sense and the majority opinion to guide your judgement when discerning intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations. Remember, routine or policy-breaking actions should not be ruled out as contributory causes based on their regularity or irregularity alone. Identify roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors in defining cause, especially where there is a chain of causality involving individual actions and decisions. Analyze the causation chain considering both human and systemic factors.

   prompt: Examine a scenario and differentiate among diverse actions to answer questions about cause-and-effect and intent. Each action, both direct and indirect, should be assessed distinctly for its immediate and ripple effects. Recognize that 'intentionality' and 'cause' can be understood in both tight (pertaining to immediate impacts) and broad (incorporating systemic factors and human involvement) contexts. Bear in mind that simply because an actor is aware that their action could potentially result in a certain outcome, it does not inherently mean they intentionally brought about the outcome, especially when it was not their main objective. Steer clear from simplistically attribiting cause to an isolated action or the final action in a sequence; multiple actions, permissions or decisions might together culminate in the outcome. Place appropriate emphasis on unexpected or irregular events where various factors interact and lead to a specific result, and examine the role of routine or non-conforming actions as contributory causes without directly correlating them to their frequency or rarity. In the analysis of causality, consider actions that either individually or in combination would generate the same outcome, while dismissing those actions that are not fundamental in reaching that outcome. For judgements pertaining to intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations, rely on logical reasoning and general opinion. It's essential to identify the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors when determining cause, particularly if there is a causation chain involving multiple actions and decisions. Examine the sequence of causation, recognizing both human elements and systemic factors, and apply a discerning lens to differentiate between joint causality and individual causality when both are at play.

In interpreting causality, distinguish between actual planned causes and incidental consequences or mere sequences of events. Evaluate whether the result would remain the same if any of the events didn't occur, assisting in accurate determination of the contributing factors. Bear in mind that not every outcome is solely or directly caused by the event preceding it. In numerous instances, outcomes may be the result of multiple correlated factors. During your analysis, pay close attention to identifying the clear intentions and desired outcomes of the characters, differentiating them from tolerated or unforeseen consequences. Focus on understanding which outcomes were actively sought after versus those that were inevitable or passive results of the primary action. Always consider the hierarchical order of the events or intentions, which should guide you to understand which actions were purposefully caused and which ones were merely subsequent effects.

   prompt: Analyze the provided scenarios using a comprehensive approach to identify the key elements leading to the observed outcomes. Keep in mind that every event can play a role, regardless of when it occurs in relation to the final result. Avoid mistaking sequences of events for actual causality. Always distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, by focusing not only on the results but also the initial intentions, motives, and objectives behind the decisions or actions taken. Consider every contributing factor, including those that might not directly precede the outcome. Try to envision alternative scenarios: would the outcome remain the same if certain events were changed or didn't occur? This can help to pinpoint the true contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are a result of one singular event or cause. In many instances, outcomes are born out of a combination of several factors. Avoid binary interpretation where the direct cause is misconceived as the singular cause. Comprehend the difference between someone/something intentionally causing an outcome or just being part of a sequence of events that led to it.

   prompt: In analyzing the given scenarios, pay close attention to the integral elements contributing to the outcomes. Strive to comprehend the complete context of the associated causal factors, taking into account that conditions may often occur simultaneously or in multiples, which could drive the outcome. Every event, regardless of its immediacy or role in relation to the outcome, holds significance. When interpreting causality, distinguish between actual causes that were intended versus incidental consequences or mere event sequences. If any of the events didn't occur, evaluate whether the end result would have remained the same, assisting in accurate determination of the key contributing factors. Bear in mind that not all outcomes are solely or directly caused by the event immediately preceding it, as outcomes often result from numerous interrelated factors. During your analysis, allocate due weight to the clear intentions and desired outcomes of the characters, noting the difference between active and passive results or unforeseen consequences of their actions. Consider policy or rule violations, as well as the specific actions that breached normal procedures, as potentially significant causal factors. Likewise, it's essential to scrutinize the order of events and their hierarchical significance in understanding causality, particularly when rules or protocols are involved. Always bear in mind that a cause could involve multiple actions happening together, not just a single action in isolation. Differentiating between events that were intentionally brought about and those that were merely subsequent effects requires careful analysis.

   prompt: When analyzing the presented scenarios, delve into the study of causation by identifying the elements crucial to the outcome. The key is to understand the comprehensive narrative of the causal factors involved, keeping in mind that events might be concurrent, multiply their effects, or form a chain that drives to the outcome. Give weight to all events, whether their impact is immediate or ultimate to the result—they all warrant consideration. Understand that interpreting causality isn't just about identifying actual planned causes; discern incidental consequences that may have occurred as a result of an action regardless of the actor's intention towards the secondary outcome. Evaluate the importance of each event by considering if the final outcome would remain unaltered if any of these events were removed or didn't occur, as this will aid in accurately identifying those factors instrumental in shaping the outcome. While acknowledging that a specific outcome isn't always dependent on the event that directly precedes it, always consider the complexity of interplay among multiple factors that may lead to the given outcome. Analyzing the actions of the individuals or groups involved is also essential—pay heed to their intentions, desired outcomes, and the consequences that they either tolerated, aimed for, or simply didn't anticipate. Probe into which outcomes were actively sought after, which were simply tolerated, and which were inevitable effects of actions taken—irrespective of whether the individuals cared for all correlated outcomes or just some. When considering the order of events, be mindful of those actions that while intended to cause a specific outcome, also led to other inescapable results. These actions are crucial, as they hold the potential to reshape our understanding of intentionality and causality, enabling us to discern between actions that were purposefully undertaken and those which were merely following effects.

   prompt: When analyzing the scenarios, concentrate on identifying the events leading directly to the end result. Recognize the key elements that invariably contribute to the outcomes. Aim to comprehend the comprehensive milieu of the causal factors, noting that events may arise simultaneously or multiply, potentially impacting the final outcome. Keep in mind that all occurences are pivotal, whether instant or ultimate, in respect to the outcome. In your causality interpretation, differentiate between intended causal actions and incidental outcomes or mere series of events. Evaluate the scenario considering whether the result would have been the same had any of the decisive events not transpired, assisting in the precise identification of contributing factors. Be aware that a cause isn't always the event that immediately precedes an outcome. Often, outcomes transpire as a combination of several correlated factors. Always pay particular attention to the clear intentions and anticipated outcomes of the characters, separating them from accidental or unforeseen outcomes. Emphasize on understanding which events were deliberately sought and which ones happened regardless of the primary action. Always review the hierarchical order of situations or intentions - doing so should guide you to distinguish between actions that were deliberately instigated and those that were simply resultant effects. Above all, ensure you grasp the question's key focus and align your analysis accordingly, giving higher weight to the immediate triggers of an event particularly when explicitly indicated. Don't overlook or underestimate intended actions in your analysis and ensure you balance your understanding between immediate action-consequence events and multiple backdrop factors that co-lead to the outcome.

   prompt: Examine the given scenarios critically using a holistic approach to identify the pivotal elements that lead to the outcomes. Every event, regardless of when it occurs in the sequence leading to the final result, could play a role. Sequences of events are different from actual causality. Therefore, careful analysis is required to differentiate a sequence from a cause; as every action in a sequence might or might not be a cause. Distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, but be aware that the intentions behind an action do not necessarily impact the outcome. Any contributing factor should be given due consideration, even if it does not directly follow before the outcome. Ponder over alternative scenarios: would the outcome change if certain events were altered or if they did not happen? This might assist in identifying the legitimate contributing factors. Not all outcomes stem from a singular event or cause, often they are the result of a cumulative effect of several incidents. Avoid oversimplified interpretation where the direct cause is misunderstood to be the only cause. Understand the difference between an entity intentionally causing an outcome and being a unit in the sequence of events that lead to the outcome. Make sure to pay extra attention to any given conditions or rules in the scenario, as these often shape the outcome.

   prompt: In the given scenarios, dissect each component and identify the substantive factors that contribute to the eventual outcomes. Do not forget to consider every event, regardless of its timing, and resist the temptation to perceive sequences of events as automatic causality. It is important to differentiate between incidental and deliberate results. To do this effectively, focus not merely on what happened but also why it happened - the initial intentions, motives and objectives behind the decisions or actions. Know that a cause and a trigger are often different: while a trigger merely sets off the sequence of events leading to an outcome, a cause is the root reason that puts the entire series of events into action. Bear in mind too that every contributing factor is vital, and the one right before the outcome isn't always the sole or primary cause. Envision alternative scenarios where certain events are altered or omitted; would the result still be the same? This exercise will assist you in identifying the real factors at play. When an outcome is the product of numerous factors, it is essential not to fall into the trap of simplistically attributing it to a single direct cause. Understand the distinction between something or someone intentionally leading to a result or merely being part of the event series that resulted in it. Especially hone in on instances where violations or negligence of established policies or rules set the stage for the final outcome. This holistic and nuanced interpretation of causality will allow for a more accurate understanding of the events.

   prompt: Utilize a comprehensive approach to dissect the presented scenarios and discern the key elements that catalyze the observed outcomes. It's essential to recognize that every event, no matter its timing, can potentially influence the end results. Beware of wrongly attributing causality to mere sequential events, and always discriminate between incidental and intentional outcomes. This involves delving into the intentions, motives, and objectives which drove the decisions or actions taken, not just focusing on the resultant effect. Consider each contributing factor, inclusive of those that might not immediately precede the outcome. Imagine alternative scenarios: would the outcome vary if certain events were altered or non-existent? This could assist in clarifying the genuine contributing elements. Acknowledge that not all events are driven by a single cause. Outcomes, in many instances, exist as a result of a blend of numerous factors. Be sure to avoid oversimplified cause-and-effect narratives where the directly preceding cause is misconstrued as the only determinant. Also, understand the difference between instances where an outcome is deliberately caused or when an entity is merely part of a chain of events leading up to it. Comprehend that authorizations to perform actions are also causal elements. Consider swaying away from attributing an outcome to a singular event, particularly in cases where it's a given action or a predetermined event.

   prompt: Carefully examine the provided scenarios utilizing a comprehensive approach to pinpoint the critical factors that influence the outcomes. Every event, no matter its position in the timeline leading to the end result, could play a significant role. Keep in mind that a string of events is different from cause and effect. Thus, your analysis should differentiate between a sequence and the actual causes; every action in a sequence may or may not be a cause. Make a distinction between incidental and direct outcomes, but understand that the initial intentions behind an action do not always influence the result. Keep your focus broad to account for all factors, even if they do not directly precede the outcome. Think about how the scenarios might shift if certain events were altered or did not happen - this may help identify the real contributing factors. Remember, not every outcome comes from a single event or cause; often, the culminating effect of several incidents leads to the results. Be wary of overly-simplistic interpretations where the immediate cause, whether intentional, incidental, or unintentional, is mistaken for the exclusive cause. Inaction can sometimes be as potent as an action in influencing outcomes. Understand the difference between causing an event intentionally and being a part of a sequence that led to an event, even if unintended and indirect, the impact could be significant. Lastly, adhere to the conditions and rules detailed in the scenario as these often guide the final outcomes.

   prompt: Analyze the presented scenarios by applying a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to identify the essential factors leading to the end results. Note that every event, regardless of its position in the sequence, may have a contributory role, and sequences of events shouldn't be misunderstood as actual causality. Differentiate effectively between a sequence of events and causation, understanding that an event within a sequence may or may not be integral to the outcome. Strive to distinguish between incidental and deliberate outcomes, keeping in mind that even though intentionality is relevant, it doesn't always influence the resulting outcome. Give every potential contributing factor its due consideration, even those not directly preceding the outcome. Reflect on hypothetical scenarios: does altering or omitting certain events impact the outcome, and can the result exist without them? Evaluations like these may assist in identifying the true contributing factors. Note that outcomes often result from the cumulative effect of multiple events rather than one isolated incident, and avoid oversimplifying by attributing the outcome solely to the most proximate cause. Comprehend the distinction between an entity purposefully instigating an outcome and merely being a part of the succession of events leading to it. Prioritize understanding given conditions or rules within scenarios, as these can have a shaping influence on outcomes. Emphasize on understanding the role of each individual and the chronological order of events to accurately determine the causality, especially in scenarios with rules or in situations where certain conditions lead to outcomes. When outcomes depend upon meeting any of multiple conditions, the event satisfying a condition first becomes the primary cause over subsequent fulfilling events.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the given scenarios to ascertain the key events or actions leading to the outcomes. Always consider the timing of events, but do not attribute significance solely based on sequence. Aim to distinguish between actual cause and effect and mere progression of events. Also, differentiate between incidental and deliberate outcomes, keeping in mind that an intentional action may not necessarily impact the resulting outcome. It's crucial to realize that knowingly not avoiding a foreseeable harmful outcome can be seen as intent. Understand that a single event satisfying a requirement for an outcome is often considered a causal factor, even if there are other contributing factors. Engage in thoughtful consideration of all contributing factors, not just those immediately preceding the outcome. Think about what might happen if certain events were modified or didn't occur altogether - would the final outcome still be the same? Keep in mind that not all outcomes arise from a single cause but are often the result of an accumulation of events or factors. Seek to avoid oversimplified causal interpretations. Recognize that an individual or entity may be a part of the sequence of events leading to an outcome without necessarily being the intentional cause. Lastly, make sure to properly consider any given conditions or rules within the scenario that may significantly influence the outcome. Please answer based on these guidelines.

   prompt: Answer questions about causal attribution considering both the sequence of actions and their direct and indirect results. Assess both immediate and distant influences on the outcome, prioritizing higher immediate or direct causes over distant or indirect ones. When determining intent or causality for an action, consider whether an actor is aware that a specific action will reliably lead to an expected outcome, and weigh 'intentionality' and 'cause' in terms of both strict and broad interpretations. Utilize common sense or prevailing contentious opinions when interpreting unclear scenarios.

   prompt: Answer questions about causal attribution taking into account a nuanced approach towards causality and intentionality. Consider both direct and indirect results of actions, but differentiate appropriately between primary intention (actions are guided by the primary aim to achieve a specific outcome) and secondary intention (actions are carried out despite awareness of potential secondary outcomes). In evaluating causality, pay special attention to instances when direct cause arises from a violation of rules or unexpected circumstances. Also consider situations where an actor's actions have both intended and unintended consequences. Use a broad interpretation for 'intentionality' and 'cause' when an actor is playing within the rules or acting as per expectations. Use a strict interpretation when actions deviate from the norm or when an actor knowingly acts in a way that will cause a definite outcome. Emphasize shifting degrees of causal responsibility: one can be part of an event but bear more, less, or no causal responsibility based on their role, intentions, and the existing rules.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution by evaluating both direct and indirect consequences of actions. Remember that if an actor is aware that an action will lead to a certain outcome, it is generally viewed as intentional towards that resulting outcome, even if it is not their primary goal. Nonetheless, in scenarios where an action aligns with an established pattern or expected outcome, it should not always be counted as the direct cause. Pay more attention to unexpected or irregular events when multiple factors converge to create a specific outcome. When evaluating causation, consider factors that individually lead to the same result and disregard outcomes of unnecessary actions. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' with both strict and broad lenses, keeping in mind that normal or routine events should not be over-emphasized as major causes. Lastly, utilize common sense or majority opinion when there is ambiguity in the intentionality or causality.

   prompt: Analyze and evaluate questions about causal attribution, focusing particularly on both direct and indirect outcomes of actions. Keep in mind that 'intentionality' and 'cause' can be perceived differently. If an actor knowingly takes an action that leads to a certain outcome, it can be viewed as intentional towards that outcome, even if that is not the main goal. But, always differentiate the roles of involved parties and prioritize those who have a direct and pertinent influence on the consequences. Traditional patterns or expected outcomes should not necessarily be de-emphasized; importance must be given to the situational appropriateness whether they lead to specific outcomes or not. In situations where several factors converge, pay more attention to unexpected or non-routine events that defy regular patterns. Evaluate causality by assessing contributing factors that have independently led to a similar outcome, and try to filter out outcomes of actions that are not critical for obtaining the end result. Be cautious while evaluating ‘necessary actions’, keeping in mind that ‘necessity’ should be from the perspective of the entities who hold the final decision and are most informed about possible consequences. Use common sense and consistency with majority opinion when there's ambiguity around intentionality or causality, but keep in mind unintentional causality and indirect influences too.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about causation and intentionality. Evaluate both direct and indirect consequences of actions. If an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, it can be viewed as intentional if it results in that outcome—even if it's not their primary goal. However, consider the difference between initial intent and the action's end result in scenarios where the original plan doesn't match the final outcome. In cases where an action fits into an established or expected pattern, it shouldn't necessarily be seen as the direct cause. Instead, focus more on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they lead to a particular outcome in a convergence of multiple factors. When studying causation, differentiate between actors whose actions directly affect the outcome and those whose actions are merely procedural. Remember to consider primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Evaluate 'intention' and 'cause' using both strict and broad perspectives, making sure not to exaggerate the importance of normal events. The principle of double effect should be employed, where primary and secondary effects of actions are distinguished. With ambiguous scenarios, where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is unclear, try to use common sense or the majority viewpoint. Make careful assessments of the likely motives behind actions as it could provide crucial context to the actor's intent.

   prompt: Analyze and distinguish between various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences separately. Consider 'intentionality' and 'cause' both strictly and broadly. But understand that if an actor was aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their primary goal. Be aware of patterns; an action aligning with an expected outcome or routine may not necessarily be the direct cause. Instead, turn your attention to unexpected or irregular events, where multiple factors converge to create a particular outcome. In assessing cause and effect, consider those factors which singularly would lead to the same result, while disregarding outcomes of actions that were unnecessary. Utilize common-sense judgement or settle for the majority opinion when there is ambiguity in discerning intentionality or causality. But remember, an unexpected outcome occurring from a routine event doesn't automatically imply that the routine event is the major cause. Be wary of placing undue emphasis on routine actions when examining causality.

   prompt: Examine and respond to queries about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. If an actor is aware of a predictable outcome, view it as intentional if that outcome is achieved—even if the primary aim was different. However, in circumstances where the original plan evolves or diverges from the final outcome, take into consideration the difference between initial intent and the result. In scenarios where an action conforms to an expected or regular pattern, don't automatically attribute it as the direct cause. Instead, allocate a greater concentration on unexpected, irregular incidents, particularly when they lead to a specific conclusion due to a combination of several variables. Within the context of causality, distinguish between actors whose actions directly impact the result, and those which were simply part of a procedure. Consider actions that were absolutely necessary for the outcome to materialize and actions that weren't, in order to accurately measure the actor's intention. Evaluate the concepts of 'intention' and 'cause' through both narrow and broad filters, but avoid over-emphasizing routine occurrences. Apply the principle of double effect, differentiating between actions with multiple effects. Use logical reasoning or the majority viewpoint in ambiguous situations where 'intention' or 'cause' is blurred. Concentrate on the plausible motivations behind actions as it can provide useful context to gain a deeper appreciation of the actor's intent. Assess causation and intentionality, bearing in mind that outcomes can be a result of a collaboration of causes rather than a single cause.

   prompt: Deduce and answer questions related to causation and intent behind actions. Examine both the immediate and ripple effects of actions. An action can be considered intentional if the actor knew it could yield a specific outcome, even if that wasn't their primary objective. Acknowledge the divergence between the actor's initial plan and the final result, especially in scenarios where the outcome veers from the original intention. When an action conforms to a predictable pattern, it doesn't necessarily denote a direct causal relation. Place greater emphasis on irregular, unforeseen events that potentially cause a specific effect due to the intersection of various factors. For the study of causation, be sure to distinguish between actors whose actions significantly influence the outcome and those whose roles are more ancillary. Consideration should also be given to differentiating primary outcomes from secondary effects to accurately infer intentionality. 'Intention' and 'cause' should be scrutinized from multiple angles - both narrowly and broadly - to avoid overemphasis on conventional happenings. Apply the double effect principle to differentiate between primary and secondary effects of actions. Where scenarios appear ambiguous, and 'intent' or 'causality' are uncertain, resort to common sense, consensus view, or consider the context that may clarify the actor’s motive. Be mindful to evaluate the possible intent behind an action as it could shed light on significant nuances.

   prompt: Analyze and discern causation and intentionality. Differentiate between the direct and indirect consequences of actions. Keep in mind that if an actor is aware of a foreseeable outcome of an action, even if it's not the primary goal, it can be perceived as intentional if it results in that outcome. Consider the variance between initial intention and the final outcome in situations where the initial plan doesn't culminate in the intended result. In scenarios where actions align with a recurring or expected pattern, such actions should not necessarily be branded as the sole cause. Place more emphasis on unexpected and irregular events, particularly when they lead to specific results as a fusion of multiple elements. When investigating causation, distinguish between actors whose actions shape the outcome directly and those whose actions are merely procedural or fitting into established norms. Particular attention should be paid to the actions that deviate from the norm. Study primary and secondary outcomes separately to accurately gauge the actor's intentionality. Cautiously evaluate the concepts of 'intent' and 'cause', ensuring that the significance of routine happenings is not overly magnified. Invoke the principle of double effect, where primary and secondary effects of actions are demarcated. In ambiguous scenarios where 'intentionality' or 'cause' is debatable, alongside utilizing common sense or the majority viewpoint, pay particular heed to norm-deviating actions. Assess the prospective motives behind actions thoroughly, as these may provide a crucial standpoint to the actor's intent.

   prompt: Analyze and respond to questions related to causation and intentionality, considering both primary and secondary outcomes. Evaluate actions in a way that, if a predictable result comes about and the actor was aware of such predictability beforehand, view it as intentional—even if the primary goal varied. Pay attention to situations where the initial plan transforms drastically, differing from the achieved result. Apply balanced judgment in cases where an action aligns with an anticipated or routine pattern, holding back from attributing it as the immediate cause. Assign more weight to unexpected areas leading to significant outcomes, primarily when they are the synthesis of multiple variables. In the realm of causation, separate actions that deal direct contribution to a result and those which were merely procedural. When assessing, differentiate between actions that were fundamental for the outcome and actions that only played a minor or no role, to gauge intentionality accurately. Apply a nuanced interpretation of 'intention' and 'cause', navigating through both narrow and extensive perspectives, ensuring typical events are not excessively exaggerated. Implement the rule of double effect, distinguishing between actions leading to multiple outcomes. Uncertain situations having blurred lines between 'intention' and 'cause', should be dealt by embracing logical reasoning or the consensus viewpoint. Place a high focus on possible motivations behind actions as context helps in deep understanding of the actor's intent. Keep in mind, causation and intentionality assessment should recognize that outcomes stem from a collection of causes, not just a single catalyst.

   prompt: Analyze and respond to queries about causation and intentionality, taking into consideration both primary and secondary effects of actions. If an actor is aware of a likely outcome, regard it as intentional if that expected outcome is obtained—even if the primary aim diverged. However, where the original plan deviates or evolves from the final outcome, reflect on the disparity between initial intent and result. However, in cases where the action adheres to a predicted or regular pattern, refrain from attributing it as the immediate cause. Instead, emphasize on unexpected, irregular events, especially when they result in specific conclusions due to a synthesis of several variables. In the realm of causality, distinguish between actors whose actions directly provoke the result, and those which were merely administrative. Consider actions that were indispensable for actualizing the outcome and those that were unnecessary to accurately assess the actor's intention. Evaluate notions of 'intention' and 'cause' through both precise and expansive lenses, being cautious not to overstate the importance of routine incidences. Apply the principle of double effect, distinguishing actions with multiple effects. When discerning 'intention' or 'cause' in ambiguous situations, use common sense or majority opinion as a guide. Focus on conceivable motivations for actions as they can offer valuable context to understand the actor's intention better. Assess causation and intentionality, keeping in mind that results can be a collaboration of causes rather than a lone cause. Particularly, prioritize examining the necessary and sufficient conditions for an outcome to materialize and interpret actions within the broader narrative context.

   prompt: Analyze and address questions about causation and intentionality, taking into account both primary and secondary effects of actions. Should an actor be aware of a predictable consequence, attribute it as intentional if that consequence is the outcome—even if it wasn't the actor's main objective. Be aware of cases where the initial intention varies from the final outcome, and take this variance into account. Avoid stereotyping an action that aligns with an expected or regular pattern as the direct cause right away. Instead, intensify the scrutiny on uncertain, uncommon incidents that converge to a specific end through a mixture of various factors. When examining causality, make a distinct separation between actors whose actions have an immediate impact on the outcome, and those which formed just part of a process. Evaluate the necessity and irrelevance of certain actions towards the final outcome to precisely measure the actor's intent. Look into the concepts of 'intent' and 'cause' through a strict as well as a comprehensive lens, steering clear from overemphasizing routine activities. Implement the principle of double effect to differentiate between actions with primary and secondary consequences. In ambiguous situations where there's a blur between 'intent' and 'cause', resort to logical reasoning or the consensus. Pay extra attention to plausible motivations behind actions, as this could offer valuable context to better understand the actor's intent. In assessing causality, acknowledge that outcomes could be driven by multiple causes instead of a single direct cause. In scenarios involving multiple actors contributing to an outcome, consider each actor's action as an essential link in the chain of causation. When actions serve as necessary conditions for an outcome to occur, even if they are not the sole cause, consider such actions as part of causal factors.

While assessing, evaluate each action and its direct and indirect consequences distinctly. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' should be considered both narrowly (regarding immediate effects) and broadly (including systemic and human factors). Recognize that if an actor is aware that a certain outcome could result from their action, it does not always mean they intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary goal. Do not overlook the cumulative effect of multiple actions; a sequence of actions, decisions or permissions could together cause an outcome, rather than the final action alone. Pay special attention to unexpected or irregular events where a convergence of factors leads to a particular outcome. In understanding cause and effect, consider those factors that individually and collectively would lead to the same result. Discount outcomes of actions that were unnecessary in bringing about an outcome. Use common sense and the majority opinion to guide your judgement when discerning intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations. Remember, routine or policy-breaking actions should not be ruled out as contributory causes based on their regularity or irregularity alone. Identify roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors in defining cause, especially where there is a chain of causality involving individual actions and decisions.

   prompt: Apply analytical thinking to distinguish between actions in a given scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. Assess each action individually, by closely evaluating its direct and indirect consequences. Interpret 'intentionality' and 'cause' in both a strict and a broad sense. Keep in mind that awareness of a possible outcome from an action doesn't automatically mean that the actor intentionally caused that outcome, especially if it wasn't their primary intention. Be particularly cautious about actions that conform to an expected outcome or pattern; such actions may not necessarily be the direct cause. Focus more on unexpected or irregular events where multiple contributing elements converge to produce a specific result. In delving into cause-effect relationships, consider the sequence and timing of events, and the relevance of actions that singularly lead to the same outcome. At the same time, be discerning about the outcomes of actions that were superfluous or unnecessary, if an effect could have been produced without the action, it may not be a true cause. Be mindful of the role of inaction and the potential causal contribution of deciding not to intervene or change a situation. Apply common-sense judgement or fall back on the majority consensus when there's ambiguity around discerning intentionality or causality. Exercise caution in attributing a routine action as the primary cause for an outcome, particularly when an unexpected outcome arises.

   prompt: Analyze and differentiate various actions in a given scenario for determining causal attribution. In this task, conscientiously evaluate each action and the direct and indirect consequences arising from it. When pondering 'intentionality' and 'cause', treat them both in narrow and wide aspects. Be mindful that even if an individual is aware of a possible outcome of an action, it doesn't necessarily imply they intended for that outcome, particularly if it wasn't their prime aim. Pay careful attention to unexpected or anomalous events - where various factors converge to yield a unique outcome - instead of actions that align with expected outcomes. While probing cause and effect, focus on those elements which individually would lead to the same effect and brush aside outcomes from actions that are superfluous. In cases where there is ambiguity and confusion, employ pragmatic reasoning or consider the consensus when determining intentionality or causality. Specifically remember, that the occurrence of unusual outcomes from routine actions doesn't instantaneously signify that the customary action is the principal cause. Also, avoid chronological bias in examining actions, just because an action happened later in the sequence doesn't mean it has more causal significance. Provide clear focus on identifying necessary and sufficient conditions for an outcome. Lastly, avoid assigning excessive importance to routine actions when investigating causality.

   prompt: Examine a scenario and differentiate among diverse actions to answer questions about cause-and-effect and intent. Each action, both direct and indirect, should be assessed distinctly for its immediate and ripple effects. Recognize that 'intentionality' and 'cause' can be understood in both tight (pertaining to immediate impacts) and broad (incorporating systemic factors and human involvement) contexts. Bear in mind that simply because an actor is aware that their action could potentially result in a certain outcome, it does not inherently mean they intentionally brought about the outcome, especially when it was not their main objective. Steer clear from simplistically attribiting cause to an isolated action or the final action in a sequence; multiple actions, permissions or decisions might together culminate in the outcome. Place appropriate emphasis on unexpected or irregular events where various factors interact and lead to a specific result, and examine the role of routine or non-conforming actions as contributory causes without directly correlating them to their frequency or rarity. In the analysis of causality, consider actions that either individually or in combination would generate the same outcome, while dismissing those actions that are not fundamental in reaching that outcome. For judgements pertaining to intentionality or causality in ambiguous situations, rely on logical reasoning and general opinion. It's essential to identify the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic factors when determining cause, particularly if there is a causation chain involving multiple actions and decisions. Examine the sequence of causation, recognizing both human elements and systemic factors, and apply a discerning lens to differentiate between joint causality and individual causality when both are at play.

   prompt: Analyze and adjudicate upon various actions in a scenario to answer questions about causal attribution. Distinguish between each action and evaluate their direct and indirect impacts separately. 'Intentionality' and 'cause' must be considered both in a specific context (regarding immediate outcomes) and a broader context (factoring in systemic and personal issues). Understand that if an actor is aware of a certain result that could be an inevitable consequence of their action, they can still be regarded as intentionally causing that result, even if it falls outside their primary objectives. Don’t overlook the compounded effect of successive actions; a sequence of decisions, acts or permissions could collaboratively influence an outcome, rather than the terminal action in isolation. Assign due weightage to unintended but predictable outcomes of an action when interpreting intentionality. Pay close attention to unexpected or irregular events where multiple factors amalgamate leading to an unexpected outcome. In comprehending cause and effect, consider those elements that, either independently or collectively, would lead to the same corollary. Dismiss results of actions that had no crucial role in the realization of an outcome. Be aware of scenarios involving mutually inclusive conditions, and appreciate the causality contributed by each condition independently. Rely on common sense and consensus to guide your judgement in the face of ambiguity regarding intentionality or causality. Do not dismiss routine or exceptional actions as causal contributors based merely on their frequency or infrequency. Identify the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic elements in defining cause, especially where a chain of causality incorporates individual actions and decisions. Disentangle the element of accident from overarching intent in scenarios where the immediate cause of the outcome was unintended. Analyze the causality chain with a balanced view of both human and systemic influences.

   prompt: Scrutinize and discern between diverse actions in a given situation to answer queries about causal attribution. Evaluate each singular action and its immediate and indirect consequences independently. Illuminate 'intentionality' and 'cause' from both a narrow perspective (focusing on the immediate impact) and a broad scope (incorporating systemic and human elements). Recognize that an actor being aware of a potential outcome from their action doesn't necessarily imply they intentionally triggered that outcome, particularly when it isn't their primary objective. Also note that simultaneous conditions or actions can hold equal causative value unless explicitly ranked differently by the scenario or game rules. Understand the cumulative impact of a sequence of actions, decisions, or permissions that together can result in an outcome instead of attributing it to the final action alone. Pay detailed attention to unusual or irregular events converging to produce a particular outcome. As you decipher cause and effect links, contemplate those factors that alone or in combination would yield the same result. Do not attribute outcomes to actions that were not necessary in accomplishing the outcome in scenarios where multiple sufficient causes are present. Use common sense and general consensus to steer your judgement when interpreting intentionality or causality in indistinct situations. However, routinely occurring or policy-adverse actions should not be dismissed as potential contributors solely based on their frequency or abnormality. Recognize the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic circumstances in shaping cause, particularly when there is a chain of causality encompassing discrete actions and decisions. Analyze the cause-and-effect chain, integrating human and systemic factors, but also remember to apply a common-sense understanding in situations where causative structures are ambiguous.
