For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The model's input prompts the AI to determine whether there is "entailment" between the sentences, expecting the shape mentioned in the sentence following the code to be specified by the SVG path. However, the AI model seems to lack the ability to interpret the SVG path code and link it with established geometric shapes, causing it to fail to generate the correct answer. Rather, it came out with a false inference which does not follow the entailment logic, resulting in the incorrect response.

<2>
Similar to the first example, the model was unable to interpret the SVG path code to identify and derive the shape being drawn in the form of SVG paths. Its response suggests that because the shape being drawn was not explicitly stated, there was no entailment. However, this misses the point of entailment, which is not always explicitly stated in the text. The “entailment” prompt might also confuse the model, making it see no clear relationship between the two sentences.

<3> 
Once again, the model showed lack of understanding of the SVG path code. It interpreted the SVG path as a line instead of a triangle. This indicates a problem in the application of entailment command where the AI is expected to draw implied information (shape from the SVG path) that isn't explicitly mentioned.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Instead of using a simple "entailment" instruction, the prompt could be modified to give clearer direction on expectations; for instance, it could be changed to "Interpret the SVG path element and identify the shape being drawn."
2. The AI model should be equipped with prior knowledge or it should be trained to understand and interpret SVG paths.
3. Adjusting the prompt to expect implicit information might be beneficial. For example, the model could be told that the shape is not directly stated, but it should be inferred from the first sentence.
4. The prompt could specify that the answer should be one of the provided options. That way, the model has a directive to pick a response from the choices given, instead of potentially opting out with "N/A."

gradient:
<1> 
This question asked to determine the shape drawn by an SVG path element. However, the model wrongly interpreted it as a task to spot entailment between sentences. Given that the model cannot visually interpret SVG path strings, it resorted to providing the answer as (E) line, probably because lines are essential building blocks of many shapes. 

<2> 
Similar to the previous example, the model failed to interpret the question appropriately. Instead of evaluating what shape was drawn by the SVG path element, the model treated it as a language entailment task. Here again, it predictably opted for (E) line, possibly due to the lack of capability to visually interpret SVG path strings.

<3> 
The model responded with a neutral answer in this case, stating that the sentence does not entail the next. The model seems confused about the task, treating it as a task of language entailment rather than shape determination from a given SVG path. The model's choice of (E) line, however, depicts its recurring issue of failing to decipher the SVG path statement.

<4> 
Once more, the model misinterpreted the task, wrongly treating it as a language entailment task instead of determining the shape depicted in the SVG path statement. The repetitive prediction of option (E) line signifies the model's incapacity to decode the SVG path code visually.

<5> 
Despite the question's complexity due to the longer SVG path statement, the prompt’s shortcomings remain consistent. The model misunderstands the question, treating it as a sentence entailment task rather than SVG shape recognition. Once again, the model incorrectly selects (E) line.

Reasons for incorrect responses:
1. Misinterpretation of task: The model interprets the task as a task of language entailment, instead of identifying the shape drawn by an SVG path. This could be due to the prompt's initial line, "Determine whether one sentence entails the next".
2. Lack of visual interpretation of SVG paths: Even if the model understood the task, its current capability does not allow it to infer shapes from SVG path codes, leading to it defaulting to the option (E) line.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Make the task clear: Alter the initial part of the prompt to ensure that it clearly states the task, such as "Determine the shape drawn by the SVG path in the sentence".
2. Instruction to guess: Given the model's existing limitations in interpreting SVG paths, it might be useful to instruct it to make a random or educated guess when it tackles questions it does not understand.
3. Contextual Understanding: Embed the task in a context that the language model understands better, like decoding a message or solving a puzzle, so it could potentially leverage its other capabilities.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model does not understand the relationship between the SVG path element and its visual representation. Although it recognizes the mention of a line in the element, it doesn't comprehend that this 'line' is a part of the SVG path instructions and doesn't necessarily indicate the final shape. It incorrectly picks 'line' as the answer.

<2> 
Again, the model fails to understand the SVG path responsibility of drawing a shape and interprets the sentence too literally. Instead of making an educated guess, the model states that it is not possible to determine what shape is being drawn, indicating a misunderstanding of the functionality and intention of SVG paths.

<3> 
The model repeats the mistake from the first example, focusing too much on the mention of lines in the SVG path element and interpreting these as the final shape being drawn.

<4> 
The model seems to understand that a shape is being drawn from the SVG path element, but misinterprets it as an ellipse rather than a circle. This suggests that the model struggles to differentiate between similar shapes.

Based on these wrong examples, the aspects that can improve the prompt include: 
1. Highlight the connection between SVG path and the shape it represents: The prompts need to suggest that the SVG path is tasked with drawing a specific shape.
2. Teach the model about SVG paths: The model seems to lack understanding of SVG paths and their characteristics. Information about the general format of SVG paths and how the instructions correspond to drawing a shape could be useful.
3. Clarify the objective: The model should understand that the task is neither about entailment of sentences nor about finding lines in the input, but about comprehending SVG paths and the shapes they create.
4. Add explanation about differences of similar shapes: For example, model needs to know how to distinguish circle and ellipse from the SVG path.

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model seems to interpret the SVG path as a line because it doesn't analyze the multiple points created by the path. It's also possible the model does not understand the coordinate system used in SVG paths and is merely simplifying the path to a basic shape - a line - in its response.

<2> 
This example exposes the same issue as before. The model doesn't process multiple endpoints of the SVG path and hence simplifies the path to a line. It seems to not comprehend that SVG paths can create complex geometric shapes, not just basic ones.

<3> 
Again the model misidentifies the SVG path, suggesting it represents a line. Here, it seems it does not know how to differentiate between basic and more complex shapes. The difference between the prediction and the correct label indicates that the model is not correctly processing multiple points or the direction of the SVG path.

<4> 
While the SVG path may look like a line at first glance, it creates a triangle. However, as the direction of the lines alters, the model seems to have trouble understanding the transitions and likewise continues to classify it as a line.

<5> 
This example again emphasizes that the model struggles with complex shapes. The given path represents a pentagon, but the model is incorrectly simplifying it to a line. It seems that the model needs more complexity in its geometric shape understanding rather than defaulting to a line.

Improvement aspects:
1. Make sure the model understands SVG path syntax and coordinates.
2. The model must understand that SVG paths can create complex shapes, not just simple straight lines. An enhancement in the algorithm to handle multiple points of an SVG path would be necessary.
3. Implement a feature that identifies the transitions between lines in an SVG path properly. Understanding direction and intersection points will improve the prediction of complex geometric shapes.
4. The prompt could be clearer: instead of asking to interpret and infer, it might be made explicit that the path will create complex geometric shapes which might not be immediately obvious. The model might need multiple cues to fully understand the concept.
5. Possibly implement training with a larger set of geometric shapes to increase understanding complexity.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Reason for the wrong answer: The SVG path given is actually a form of a polygon. However, the model is unable to distinguish between different polygons, and only interprets it as a simple line, which is incorrect. The model might be treating the M and L commands as indicative of a straight line, and not accounting for the fact that the paths being connected by these commands can form a shape other than a line.
Improvements: The prompt needs to instruct the model to consider all coordinates given and how they connect to each other, not only in a straight line path, but also as a polygon.

<2> 
Reason for the wrong answer: Again, the path is of a polygon but the model identifies it incorrectly as a hexagon, even though the number of coordinates suggests it should be a heptagon. It seems the model lacks thorough understanding of parsing SVG path data to infer the correct shape.
Improvements: The prompt should clarify to the model how to count the number of vertices or points in the path command to deduct the correct shape.

<3> 
Reason for wrong answer: The SVG path given in this case is a circle drawn using the 'A' command in SVG. However, the model understood it as an ellipse, possibly because an ellipse is also denoted by the 'A' command in SVG paths. This signifies that the model is misinterpreting the exact specifications for creating an ellipse vs. a circle.
Improvements: The prompt should guide the model to precisely analyze the given SVG commands to differentiate between a circle that has equal radii, and an ellipse that has different radii.

<4> 
Reason for the wrong answer: The given SVG path can be interpreted as a hexagon but the model identifies it as a line. This suggests that the model does not correctly identify the rules corresponding to the drawing path behavior of a SVG element by just viewing it as simple lines instead of a complex shape.
Improvements: The model needs instruction to comprehend that multiple lines can be connected to form a geometric shape.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Guide the model to correctly interpret the 'M', 'L', and 'A' commands in SVG paths, and consider all the points given in the SVG path to form a shape.
2. Instruct the model to count the points/vertices of the path to infer polygonal shapes (hexagon, pentagon etc.).
3. Push the model to differentiate between a circle (which has equal radii), and an ellipse (which has unequal radii).
4. Clarify that multiple lines (depicted by 'L' or 'M') can be connected to form a geometric shape rather than just depict independent lines.
5. Ensure that the model gets an understanding that 'A' commands in an SVG path could indicate a full circle, a sector, or an ellipse.
6. Incorporate in the prompt instructions that check the coordinates of all points in the SVG path and handling each case separately.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the SVG path element provides a series of coordinate points forming a kite shape. Expectedly, the model only considers three points which form a triangle, rather than taking into consideration all the points. This shows that the model does not fully understand the SVG path element interpretation. The lack of clarity in the instructions might be causing confusion on how to interpret the SVG data.

<2> 
In this example, the SVG path element draws a complex shape, which is not within the options provided. However, the model deduces the shape as a kite, which appears to be an incorrect evaluation. This indicates that the model may have a weak understanding of the relationship between SVG code and the resulting images, especially for complex images.

<3> 
In the third example, the SVG path element draws a triangle, but the model recognizes it as a line. It seems that the model failed to take into consideration all the points listed, focusing only on the initial and terminal points, thereby concluding that it is a line. This is a clear indication that the task requirement is not effectively grasped by the model.

In light of the above, the following aspects can be improved in the prompt:

1. Add explicit instructions about how to interpret the SVG path element, especially taking all given points into account.
2. Provide some background information or a brief explanation of SVG paths and geometric shapes, so the model can understand SVG path elements and geometric shapes more effectively.
3. In addition to just identifying shapes, the task could include verifying if the shape derived from the SVG path element matches any of the provided in the options. This can reduce the likelihood of matching the SVG path with an incorrect shape.
4. The instruction could ask the generated model to first list the potential shapes the SVG path element could represent, then match these with the given options. This way, the model might not rush into a conclusion.
5. The use of more structured language in the question could aid in better comprehension by the model.
6. Examples could be included within the prompt to offer the model a chance to learn from them.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question asks the model to analyze the SVG path and visualize the geometric shape drawn by the path. However, it seems the model tends to misidentify the hexagonal shape as a kite shape. This could be due to the complexity in determining the path's shape merely from interpreting the listed coordinates and directions. Additionally, these coordinates might easily be misinterpreted to form different shapes.

<2>
Just like in the first example, the model misinterpreted the given SVG path coordinates and directions to form a different shape than intended. This could be a result of the model overgeneralizing certain shapes, like potentially associating multiple lines and sharp turns with a kite shape.

<3>
In this case, the model identified the shape as an ellipse instead of a circle. While both shapes involve curves, they are distinctly different. This demonstrates potential shortcomings of the model in differentiating between very similar shapes.

<4>
Once again, the model identified the shape as a kite, despite the coordinates representing a heptagon. This could be due to the specific phrasing in the prompt that emphasizes complex geometric shapes, which the model might not correctly interpret as heptagons.

<5>
The model's tendency towards interpreting the shape as a kite persists in this example, resulting in a missed heptagon again.

**Prompt Improvement**

In light of the above analysis, there are a few aspects that can improve this prompt and reduce the chance of misinterpretations:

1. More explicit instructing: The model seems to struggle with differentiating shapes with similar attributes. Therefore, the prompt could include additional instructions or questions that focus on determining the specific characteristics of each shape, such as the number of sides, angles, intersecting lines, etc.

2. Adjust focus: Instead of solely focusing on complex shapes, the prompt could encourage the model to consider simpler shapes as well.

3. Provide real examples: Giving some examples of analyzing a SVG path to shapes in the prompt could help the model understand what it needs to do.

4. Draw attention to answer list: The prompt could more explicitly highlight the importance of the answer list, encouraging the model to select answers from this list only.

5. Explain SVG properties: Additional explanation on how to interpret SVG properties, such as coordinates and direction of paths, might improve how the model analyzes the given paths. 

6. Highlighting difference between geometrical shapes: Add criteria to differentiate between shapes that involve curves like circle and ellipse. For instance, criteria that an ellipse has two different radii, whereas a circle has an equal radius.

7. Feedback loop: Incorporate a step that allows the model to reevaluate its first choice if there is ambiguity.

Improving in these areas could help the model make more accurate predictions for the geometric shapes represented by different SVG paths.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The prompt asks the model to form a complex geometric shape from given SVG coordinates, but the model selects 'kite' as the answer instead of 'pentagon'. The SVG path element's analysis seems to lack precision in the model's interpretation, as it misidentified the shape just by reading the coordinates. This implies a lack of accurate image visualization capability.

<2>
The model incorrectly identified a 'kite' instead of a 'heptagon' from the SVG path element. It might be due to the model’s inability to visualize the shape from the provided coordinates properly. It seems to lean towards common and simpler shapes like the 'kite' rather than accurately visualize complex shapes in its response.

<3>
The model chose the wrong option ('octagon') from the path's coordinates instead of 'pentagon'. The model has not correctly interpreted the instructions and is making an error in identifying the coordinates and visualizing the accurate shapes. It might be due to the complexity of the shape or the number of coordinates or lines involved.

<4>
The model's response once again incorrectly determines the shape as a 'kite', whereas it is a 'hexagon'. The model seems to favor the shape 'kite', which suggests the model might not have a wide range of understanding about geometric shapes beyond simpler shapes.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Include instructions for the model to count the number of unique points or lines, as this would aid in more accurately identifying shapes like polygons.
2. Specify that the model should consider the lengths and angles between the lines in the SVG file. This would help it distinguish between shapes with similar properties.
3. Encourage the model to consider both regular and irregular versions of shapes.
4. Elucidate more on classifying the shape. For instance, instead of simply saying 'hexagon', specify if it is a regular hexagon (where all sides and angles are equal) or an irregular hexagon (where the sides and angles differ).
5. Add instructions to have the model walk through its visualization process step-by-step, for every coordinate and every turning, to ensure it is not oversimplifying its interpretation of the complex shape.
6. The prompt could specify that the model should avoid making biased predictions, such as over-predicting simpler shapes like 'kite'.
7. Ensure the model is instructed to take into account the complexity and intricate details of the SVG path to estimate the right shape rather than just following a linear path.
8. Detailed instructions could be added regarding how to correctly interpret complex figures and making sure to not confuse them with simpler shapes.
9. Remind the model to mask any premature assumptions about shapes before analyzing all coordinates and paths.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The question prompt asks the model to visualize a complex geometric shape based on SVG path element coordinates. In this example, the path element corresponds to an ellipse-like shape, but the correct answer is a circle (A). The model, however, predicts an ellipse (K). The reasons for the wrong answer could be:

• The model might be misunderstanding or oversimplifying the SVG path commands.
• The model might be emphasizing the "complex geometric shape" part of the prompt and thus is looking for a less common shape.
• The model might not fully comprehend the properties of a circle and an ellipse and the distinction between them.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the second example, the SVG path element provided appears to form a triangle. However, the model, based on the prompt, interprets the given SVG path as a kite. The reasons for the wrong answer might be:

• The model misunderstands the pattern of how the points are connected. 
• The mention of "complex geometric shape" might have led the model to select a more complex shape (kite) over a simpler geometry (triangle).
• The model might not fully grasp the concept of intersections and turning points, leading it to visualize the wrong shape.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
From these examples and the mentioned reasons, several improvements can be made:
• Clearly specify that the shape generated might be simple or complex.
• Emphasize the need to understand the nature of the SVG path commands.
• Include instructions for the model to pay closer consideration to the differences between the different geometric figures.
• Request explicit consideration of the properties that distinguish similar shapes, like circles and ellipses, or triangles and kites.
• Encourage deeper understanding of geometric principles, intersections, and turning points. 
• Include guidance that not all SVG paths will result in complex geometric shapes.
• Add a request for the model to verify its choice by cross-checking the properties of the finalized shape with the SVG path commands.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided consists of four coordinates: (37.77, 75.87), (55.86, 59.05), (48.33, 32.16), and (37.77, 75.87). By connecting these points in order, we can visualize a shape that resembles a kite. The path starts at the first point, moves to the second point, then to the third point, and finally back to the first point, forming a shape with intersecting lines and distinct endpoints.

Therefore, the geometric shape that this path could form is a kite.

<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: J
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The question prompt asks the model to visualize a complex geometric shape based on SVG path element coordinates. In this example, the path element corresponds to an ellipse-like shape, but the correct answer is a circle (A). The model, however, predicts an ellipse (K). The reasons for the wrong answer could be:

• The model might be misunderstanding or oversimplifying the SVG path commands.
• The model might be emphasizing the "complex geometric shape" part of the prompt and thus is looking for a less common shape.
• The model might not fully comprehend the properties of a circle and an ellipse and the distinction between them.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
In the second example, the SVG path element provided appears to form a triangle. However, the model, based on the prompt, interprets the given SVG path as a kite. The reasons for the wrong answer might be:

• The model misunderstands the pattern of how the points are connected. 
• The mention of "complex geometric shape" might have led the model to select a more complex shape (kite) over a simpler geometry (triangle).
• The model might not fully grasp the concept of intersections and turning points, leading it to visualize the wrong shape.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
From these examples and the mentioned reasons, several improvements can be made:
• Clearly specify that the shape generated might be simple or complex.
• Emphasize the need to understand the nature of the SVG path commands.
• Include instructions for the model to pay closer consideration to the differences between the different geometric figures.
• Request explicit consideration of the properties that distinguish similar shapes, like circles and ellipses, or triangles and kites.
• Encourage deeper understanding of geometric principles, intersections, and turning points. 
• Include guidance that not all SVG paths will result in complex geometric shapes.
• Add a request for the model to verify its choice by cross-checking the properties of the finalized shape with the SVG path commands.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model predicts that the SVG element provided, which is a series of commands and coordinates, creates a hexagon (C). However, the correct answer is a kite (D). Even though counting line segments could provide a clue about the shape (4 lines in this case, which matches both a kite and a hexagon), it seems the model may be overly relying on this information and not being able to properly visualize the geometric shape. The model also overlooks considering the angles formed by the connecting lines which is an integral part of distinguishing shapes like a hexagon and a kite.

<2> 
The model’s answer for this SVG path is a triangle (J). However, it's supposed to be a kite (D). Again, even though the number of sides/lines is correctly interpreted, the model does not seem to correctly interpret the arrangement of the line segments. It seems to rely heavily on the number of segments instead of the structure and positioning of the line segments. Distinguishing between shapes like kites, rectangles, squares, etc., requires an understanding of the spatial arrangement and the interior angles of the vertices, rather than just how many vertices are present.

<3> 
In this example, the model assumes the drawn object by the provided path is a rectangle (H), but the correct answer is a kite (D). Once again, the model identifies the correct number of line segments but fails to accurately visualize and interpret the geometric properties of the completed shape (such as angles and line lengths). This demonstrates the model's inability to effectively visualize and interpret the sequence of path commands.

In conclusion, the prompt's focus on counting specific features such as line segments does not seem to be enough to guide the model towards the right answer. It lacks in pointing out the need to comprehend the spatial arrangement of these line segments, the angles formed at vertices, and lengths of line segments, which are crucial in identifying geometric shapes. 

Possible improvements to the prompts would include focusing less on counting features and placing more emphasis on visualizing the geometric arrangement of the shape or the values of angles formed. The model should be prompted to also consider whether any line segments are parallel or whether the shape may be symmetrical. Furthermore, including a specific mention in the prompt about correctly identifying different geometric shapes based on the characteristics of their angles and sides may be of value.  

Lastly, introducing the requirement or consideration for the SVG path to return to the starting point (to form a closed shape) might help to better distinguish between different shape options which have the same number of sides. For example, a rectangle or a square has the same number of sides as a kite, but the sides of the former shapes are parallel and the shape returns to the starting point, which isn't necessarily the case for a kite.

The model's response is: 
Analyzing the SVG path element, we can see that it consists of 8 individual line segments forming a closed loop. The path starts at point (49.84, 46.75) and moves to (48.31, 22.49), then to (64.08, 21.50), (65.61, 45.76), (81.38, 44.77), (58.72, 71.77), (34.07, 47.74), and finally back to the starting point (49.84, 46.75).

Based on the coordinates and the sequence of the lines, the shape formed is a polygon with 8 sides, which is an octagon.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(F) octagon</answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Reason:
In the first example, the model incorrectly recognized the number of line segments as the number of sides. In the given SVG path, there are indeed eight line segments. However, the geometric shape they form is not an octagon, but a heptagon. It seems that the model had a counting issue where there was a 90 degree or less sharp angle (turning). When there is a sharp turn, the path's coordinates and directions remain the same, but the count of sides is increased by two rather than one.

Improvement:
The prompt could be improved by adding extra instructions on handling points where the angle is 90 degrees or less. The model needs to identify these as two separate lines forming two different sides instead of one.

<2>
Reason:
Similarly, in the second example, the model again miscounted the number of sides, labeling a four-sided shape (kite) as a hexagon. This could be because of the complexity of the directions in the SVG path, which led the model to overestimate.

Improvement:
The prompt could underline the importance of not only counting individual line segments but also properly visualizing them based on their coordinates and directions to form the correct shape.

<3>
Reason:
In the third example, the model made a mistake in differentiating between a circle and an ellipse. Even though the SVG path element consists of two arcs with the same radius (9.79), they actually form a circle, not an ellipse. The model seems to misunderstand that the same radii for two arcs in the same path would result in an ellipse.

Improvement:
The prompt needs to include more accurate instructions about how to interpret arcs and their radii in an SVG path. Here, the fact that all radii are the same indicates a circle, not an ellipse.


Summary for Improvements:
1. Add instructions on handling points where the turning degree is 90 degrees or less.
2. Emphasize the importance of correctly visualizing the lines based on their coordinates and directions to truly understand the shape.
3. Include more specific guidelines on interpreting arcs and their radii in a SVG path.
4. The model has to understand the basic definition of geometrical shapes to avoid incorrect matches.
5. Be clear that more complex shapes might be formed from multiple simple shapes, and the model should consider this in its analysis.

Wrong Example 1:

The SVG path mentioned in the question appears to draw a complex shape and the language model, depending on the reading, interpreted this draws a triangle due to the three different points. However, the correct shape according to the options was a kite. This could be because the language model was not able to accurately interpret the SVG path in terms of both direction and magnitude which led to a failure to visualize the shape accurately. 

On analyzing the SVG path, it appears that the shape described by the path moves from the starting point to a second point then to a third point and returns back to a point different from the starting point forming a closed shape which had to be a four-sided polygon. The model, however, interpreted the returning to a different point as the same point which led to the false conclusion of the shape being a triangle.

Wrong Example 2: 

In this example, the SVG path describes an arc of a circle, not an ellipse. The language model seems to have been misled by the inclusion of two radii in the given SVG path, which are indeed equal, making the shape a circle. However, the model interpreted this as an ellipse probably because it couldn't comprehend the equality of the radii.

Improvements:

1. Improve the phrasing: While the language model does a reasonable job parsing the SVG, it seems to struggle at fully comprehending the implications of the instructions. The prompt could explicitly mention that not all the points are corners of the polygon. It could also stress on the importance of checking whether the radii of given curves are equal before concluding it's a circle or an ellipse.

2. Specific instruction for curved shapes: The current prompt instructs to differentiate between curves but does not explicitly instruct the model to check for the radius equality in case of arcs to conclude if it's a circle or an ellipse.

3. Include instruction for simple shapes: Sometimes, the SVG path might return to a point which is not the starting point but still forms a closed shape. Instructions to check for such cases can be included.

For instance, the improved prompt could be:

"Analyze the given SVG path element, taking particular note of the coordinates and sequence. Remember that not all vertices may be corners of the polygons. In the case of curves, check for equality of radii to determine if it's a circle or an ellipse. Watch out for simpler shapes that might return to a point not necessarily the starting point but still form a closed shape. After visualizing the geometric shape, select the most suitable option from the list, and place it between <answer> and </answer>."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully read the SVG path element in the first sentence. Take note of the detailed coordinates and the order in which they are sequenced. Make sure to also pay attention to the path's intersections, curves, turnings, endpoints, and whether any line segments intersect. Your task is to visualize the geometric shape from the path's coordinates and directions, keeping in mind that it might represent a complex or a simple shape. Count the number of individual lines and closed loops that might give clues about the shape. Differentiate between curves, for instance, remember an ellipse shape has two different radii while a circle has the same radius all around its center. Once you have analyzed and visualized the shape, use the conclusion to select the best matching option from the list provided. Remember, your answer should be present in the list, and express your final answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the model appears to have miscounted the number of unique corners of the polygon formed by the SVG path element. Instead of identifying the path as a seven-cornered (thus, a heptagon) polygon, the model misjudged it as a four-cornered polygon (a kite).

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of SVG Path: The model didn't correctly interpret the SVG path "M" commands as containing new subpaths or disconnected parts of the image rather than as corners of the main polygonal shape. This misunderstanding caused the model to incorrectly visualize and count the shape's corners.
2. Ignoring Polygons with Intersections: The model seems to struggle with identifying polygons that have intersecting lines or disjoint segments. As per the initial SVG path, there might be a case of overlapping shapes.

Wrong Example 2:
Again, the model seems to have misinterpreted the SVG path element. It regarded the shape as a five-cornered polygon (pentagon), while it actually forms an eight-cornered polygon (octagon).

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of SVG Path: Like in the first example, the model didn't correctly count the corners of the polygon. The model seems to regard the moves ("M") in the path as indicators of new subpaths, rather than geometric points that are part of the main shape.
2. Overlooking Connections: The model might be missing connections between points due to the layout of the SVG path.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Clearer Task Explanation: The interpretation and processing of SVG path commands should be better explained to avoid misinterpretation. Especially for "M" commands.
2. Handling Intersections and Turns: The model should be better equipped to follow the path delineated by the SVG commands and identify intersections or turns as distinct corners.
3. Refinement of Visualization: The model should be refined to better visualize potentially complex shapes and path intersections, and correctly identify endpoints that might form corners of the polygon.
4. Consideration for Overlapping Shapes: The model should consider the possibility of overlapping shapes while calculating the number of sides and corners.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided describes a shape with the following coordinates and directions: 
1. Starting at (40.59, 71.40) and moving to (40.34, 65.66)
2. Moving from (40.34, 65.66) to (46.61, 64.69)
3. Moving from (46.61, 64.69) to (45.64, 58.42)
4. Moving from (45.64, 58.42) to (51.19, 56.91)
5. Moving from (51.19, 56.91) to (56.45, 61.88)
6. Moving from (56.45, 61.88) to (55.30, 71.05)
7. Moving from (55.30, 71.05) to (46.19, 74.38)
8. Finally, moving from (46.19, 74.38) back to the starting point at (40.59, 71.40)

Based on the sequence of coordinates and the closed circuit formed, the shape described by the SVG path element is a (G) pentagon.

<answer>(G) pentagon</answer>

The correct label is: F
The model's prediction is: G.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the model appears to have miscounted the number of unique corners of the polygon formed by the SVG path element. Instead of identifying the path as a seven-cornered (thus, a heptagon) polygon, the model misjudged it as a four-cornered polygon (a kite).

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of SVG Path: The model didn't correctly interpret the SVG path "M" commands as containing new subpaths or disconnected parts of the image rather than as corners of the main polygonal shape. This misunderstanding caused the model to incorrectly visualize and count the shape's corners.
2. Ignoring Polygons with Intersections: The model seems to struggle with identifying polygons that have intersecting lines or disjoint segments. As per the initial SVG path, there might be a case of overlapping shapes.

Wrong Example 2:
Again, the model seems to have misinterpreted the SVG path element. It regarded the shape as a five-cornered polygon (pentagon), while it actually forms an eight-cornered polygon (octagon).

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of SVG Path: Like in the first example, the model didn't correctly count the corners of the polygon. The model seems to regard the moves ("M") in the path as indicators of new subpaths, rather than geometric points that are part of the main shape.
2. Overlooking Connections: The model might be missing connections between points due to the layout of the SVG path.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Clearer Task Explanation: The interpretation and processing of SVG path commands should be better explained to avoid misinterpretation. Especially for "M" commands.
2. Handling Intersections and Turns: The model should be better equipped to follow the path delineated by the SVG commands and identify intersections or turns as distinct corners.
3. Refinement of Visualization: The model should be refined to better visualize potentially complex shapes and path intersections, and correctly identify endpoints that might form corners of the polygon.
4. Consideration for Overlapping Shapes: The model should consider the possibility of overlapping shapes while calculating the number of sides and corners.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Interpret the SVG path element in the first sentence and infer the geometric shape it represents from the options provided. Then, express your answer by indicating the corresponding option.
(2) Analyze the SVG path element in the first sentence, taking into account every coordinate and the direction of the path. Try to visualize a complex geometric shape that this path could form, beyond just a simple line, by considering intersections, turnings, and endpoints. Once you determine the geometric shape, express your answer by selecting the most accurate option from the list provided. At the end, show your answer option by encapsulating it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Carefully read the SVG path element in the first sentence. Take note of the detailed coordinates and the order in which they are sequenced. Make sure to also pay attention to the path's intersections, curves, turnings, endpoints, and whether any line segments intersect. Your task is to visualize the geometric shape from the path's coordinates and directions, keeping in mind that it might represent a complex or a simple shape. Count the number of individual lines and closed loops that might give clues about the shape. Differentiate between curves, for instance, remember an ellipse shape has two different radii while a circle has the same radius all around its center. Once you have analyzed and visualized the shape, use the conclusion to select the best matching option from the list provided. Remember, your answer should be present in the list, and express your final answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Thoroughly examine the SVG path element in the first sentence. Note every single coordinate and their sequence. Keep in mind that not all points necessarily form corners of the polygon. Be attentive to path's characteristics like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and the possibility of line segments colliding. Visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions - it could be elaborate or straightforward. Count all individual line sections and identify closed circuits that might suggest a shape. For curved shapes, differentiate between a circle and an ellipse by checking the radii for equality. If both radii are equal it denotes a circle, if not it's an ellipse. Also, remember that a path might return to a point which is not the starting point, still forming a closed shape. Upon analyzing and visualizing the shape, select the most fitting option based on your conclusion from the list provided. Please make sure the selected answer is placed between <answer> and </answer>.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Analyze in detail the SVG path element in the opening sentence, noting each coordinate and the order in which they appear. It's important to understand that not all points necessarily form vertices of the polygon, but could also be part of curves or straight lines. Be thorough in examining the path, considering elements such as intersecting lines, rounds, changes in direction, start, and end points, and the potential for collision between line segments. From the coordinates and directional information given, visualize the constructed shape - this could range from simple geometric forms to more intricate designs. Identify all separate line segments and discern closed paths that might suggest the formation of a specific shape. In the case of curved shapes, distinguish between a circle and an ellipse by comparing the radii. If the radii are equal, then the shape is a circle; if different, it's an ellipse. Keep in mind that a path can loop back to a point other than the starting point and still form a closed figure. After evaluating and visualizing the shape, choose the closest geometric form to represent the figure from the list provided. Please make sure to wrap your selected answer between <answer> and </answer> tags. Special attention should be given to understand "M" as a "move to" command in the path string which does not indicate a new subpath but is part of the overall shape. Be cautious with polygons that have intersecting lines or disjointed segments as they might indicate a more complex shape or overlapping figures. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Reason: Although the model correctly understood the prompt and followed its instructions, the shape drawn was incorrectly recognized as a hexagon. This may have been due to incorrect interpretation of the coordinates, counting the same line twice or considering angles as distinct lines thereby. The model does not seem to differentiate correctly between different polygon types.

<2> 
Reason: The model seemingly misunderstood the SVG path. It suggested a triangle, however, the correct answer was a kite. It appears to have made an error in interpreting the shape's properties (possibly assuming a three-sided closed circuit instead of four).

<3> 
Reason: The model again seemed to misinterpret the SVG path. While recognizing that the path forms a closed shape, it incorrectly identified the shape as a hexagon rather than a heptagon. This would suggest an issue with correctly recognizing or distinguishing between polygons with different numbers of sides.

<4> 
Reason: In this case, the model misinterpreted the arcs described in the SVG path element as forming an ellipse when they, in fact, form a circle. This suggests the model might struggle to differentiate between circles and ellipses based on the directions in the SVG path - specifically, it seems to not correctly identify when both radii are equal.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Differentiation between polygons: The model seems to struggle distinguishing between polygons based on their number of sides and vertices. The concept could be simplified, or the model could be trained more specifically using a variety of polygon examples.
2. Interpretation of SVG path: The model appears to misunderstand certain directions in SVG paths. More specific instructions about interpreting 'move to' (M) or 'arc' (A) commands might improve the results.
3. Understanding of geometric shapes and their properties: The model seems to struggle with understanding curves, circles, and ellipses. Making the instructions about curved shapes more unambiguous and explicit could help.
4. Improving visualization ability: The model, in its current state, seems to struggle with visualizing the shapes from the given coordinates and directions. In order to make the instructions more effective, the prompts could encourage better visualization or include more examples or practice sets involving spatial reasoning skills.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided consists of the following coordinates and directions: 
1. Starting point at (45.69, 25.31)
2. Line to (40.91, 29.82)
3. Line to (38.10, 30.67)
4. Line to (39.84, 28.30)
5. Line to (45.69, 25.31)

Upon visualizing the shape described by these coordinates, it forms a closed circuit that resembles a triangle. Therefore, the most fitting option is:
<answer>(J) triangle</answer>

The correct label is: D

The model's input is:
Thoroughly examine the SVG path element in the first sentence. Note every single coordinate and their sequence. Keep in mind that not all points necessarily form corners of the polygon. Be attentive to path's characteristics like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and the possibility of line segments colliding. Visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions - it could be elaborate or straightforward. Count all individual line sections and identify closed circuits that might suggest a shape. For curved shapes, differentiate between a circle and an ellipse by checking the radii for equality. If both radii are equal it denotes a circle, if not it's an ellipse. Also, remember that a path might return to a point which is not the starting point, still forming a closed shape.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided consists of two elliptical arcs. The first arc starts at point (12.89, 87.25) and has a radius of 28.33 units. It spans an angle of 124.93 degrees and is drawn in a counterclockwise direction. The arc ends at point (45.33, 40.79). The second arc starts at point (45.33, 40.79) and also has a radius of 28.33 units. It spans the same angle of 124.93 degrees and is drawn in a counterclockwise direction, ending back at the starting point (12.89, 87.25).

Based on the analysis, the shape described by the SVG path element is an (K) ellipse.

<answer>(K) ellipse</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: K.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Reason: Although the model correctly understood the prompt and followed its instructions, the shape drawn was incorrectly recognized as a hexagon. This may have been due to incorrect interpretation of the coordinates, counting the same line twice or considering angles as distinct lines thereby. The model does not seem to differentiate correctly between different polygon types.

<2> 
Reason: The model seemingly misunderstood the SVG path. It suggested a triangle, however, the correct answer was a kite. It appears to have made an error in interpreting the shape's properties (possibly assuming a three-sided closed circuit instead of four).

<3> 
Reason: The model again seemed to misinterpret the SVG path. While recognizing that the path forms a closed shape, it incorrectly identified the shape as a hexagon rather than a heptagon. This would suggest an issue with correctly recognizing or distinguishing between polygons with different numbers of sides.

<4> 
Reason: In this case, the model misinterpreted the arcs described in the SVG path element as forming an ellipse when they, in fact, form a circle. This suggests the model might struggle to differentiate between circles and ellipses based on the directions in the SVG path - specifically, it seems to not correctly identify when both radii are equal.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Differentiation between polygons: The model seems to struggle distinguishing between polygons based on their number of sides and vertices. The concept could be simplified, or the model could be trained more specifically using a variety of polygon examples.
2. Interpretation of SVG path: The model appears to misunderstand certain directions in SVG paths. More specific instructions about interpreting 'move to' (M) or 'arc' (A) commands might improve the results.
3. Understanding of geometric shapes and their properties: The model seems to struggle with understanding curves, circles, and ellipses. Making the instructions about curved shapes more unambiguous and explicit could help.
4. Improving visualization ability: The model, in its current state, seems to struggle with visualizing the shapes from the given coordinates and directions. In order to make the instructions more effective, the prompts could encourage better visualization or include more examples or practice sets involving spatial reasoning skills.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Interpret the SVG path element in the first sentence and infer the geometric shape it represents from the options provided. Then, express your answer by indicating the corresponding option.
(2) Analyze the SVG path element in the first sentence, taking into account every coordinate and the direction of the path.

(3) Carefully read the SVG path element in the first sentence. Take note of the detailed coordinates and the order in which they are sequenced. Make sure to also pay attention to the path's intersections, curves, turnings, endpoints, and whether any line segments intersect. Your task is to visualize the geometric shape from the path's coordinates and directions, keeping in mind that it might represent a complex or a simple shape. Count the number of individual lines and closed loops that might give clues about the shape. Differentiate between curves, for instance, remember an ellipse shape has two different radii while a circle has the same radius all around its center. Once you have analyzed and visualized the shape, use the conclusion to select the best matching option from the list provided. Remember, your answer should be present in the list, and express your final answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

Be attentive to path's characteristics like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and the possibility of line segments colliding. Visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions - it could be elaborate or straightforward. Count all individual line sections and identify closed circuits that might suggest a shape. For curved shapes, differentiate between a circle and an ellipse by checking the radii for equality. If both radii are equal it denotes a circle, if not it's an ellipse. Also, remember that a path might return to a point which is not the starting point, still forming a closed shape.

<START> Examine the SVG path element in the first sentence with precision, paying close attention to every coordinate and their ordered sequence. Keep in mind that not all points can be regarded as vertices. Notice the attributes of the path like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and potential for colliding line segments.

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The question asks the AI to analyze the SVG path element to determine what shape it forms. The model misidentifies a pentagon (G) instead of the correct answer - a kite (H). Analyzing the SVG path `<path d="M 91.75,59.03 L 21.94,80.38 L 10.27,42.20 L 80.07,20.85 L 91.75,59.03"/>`, it forms a kite shape, but the model did not take the correct measure of interpreting the paths as corners, and it instead counted four line segments and incorrectly identified them as forming a pentagon.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
This SVG path `<path d="M 39.53,40.66 L 36.95,20.64 L 49.96,18.96 M 49.96,18.96 L 52.55,38.98 L 65.56,37.30 L 47.99,58.90 L 26.52,42.34 L 39.53,40.66"/>` forms a heptagon (7 sides), but the model incorrectly identifies it as a kite (D). The model erroneously excluded some path segments, which resulted in it visualizing a different shape.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Make it clear that the model needs to only count the unique points for determining the potential polygon shapes. This would help avoid misconceptions related to considering any line sections as forming separate corners.
2. Include instructions for properly identifying polygons by the number of unique points.
3. The prompt should include guidance on dealing with consecutive lines, i.e., interpreting the subsequence of moves ("M") and lines ("L") to form separate shapes as in example 2. The instructions should specify more clearly that a closed polygonal path should end at its initial starting point.
4. The model should refine the understanding of the path direction in SVG format to ensure that it doesn't count any re-visited points as extra corners or endpoints.
5. Refine the language model's understanding of the mathematical characteristics of geometric polygons and shapes. Including more specifications about line segments, points, angles and how to deduce a shape's form. This could potentially help to avoid confusion in predicting the correct shape.

This SVG path `<path d="M 39.53,40.66 L 36.95,20.64 L 49.96,18.96 M 49.96,18.96 L 52.55,38.98 L 65.56,37.30 L 47.99,58.90 L 26.52,42.34 L 39.53,40.66"/>` forms a heptagon (7 sides), but the model incorrectly identifies it as a kite (D). The model erroneously excluded some path segments, which resulted in it visualizing a different shape.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Make it clear that the model needs to only count the unique points for determining the potential polygon shapes. This would help avoid misconceptions related to considering any line sections as forming separate corners.
2. Include instructions for properly identifying polygons by the number of unique points.
3. The prompt should include guidance on dealing with consecutive lines, i.e., interpreting the subsequence of moves ("M") and lines ("L") to form separate shapes as in example 2. The instructions should specify more clearly that a closed polygonal path should end at its initial starting point.
4. The model should refine the understanding of the path direction in SVG format to ensure that it doesn't count any re-visited points as extra corners or endpoints.
5. Refine the language model's understanding of the mathematical characteristics of geometric polygons and shapes. Including more specifications about line segments, points, angles and how to deduce a shape's form. This could potentially help to avoid confusion in predicting the correct shape.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Interpret the SVG path element in the first sentence and infer the geometric shape it represents from the options provided. Then, express your answer by indicating the corresponding option.
(2) Analyze the SVG path element in the first sentence, taking into account every coordinate and the direction of the path. Try to visualize a complex geometric shape that this path could form, beyond just a simple line, by considering intersections, turnings, and endpoints. Once you determine the geometric shape, express your answer by selecting the most accurate option from the list provided. At the end, show your answer option by encapsulating it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Carefully read the SVG path element in the first sentence. Take note of the detailed coordinates and the order in which they are sequenced. Make sure to also pay attention to the path's intersections, curves, turnings, endpoints, and whether any line segments intersect. Your task is to visualize the geometric shape from the path's coordinates and directions, keeping in mind that it might represent a complex or a simple shape. Count the number of individual lines and closed loops that might give clues about the shape. Differentiate between curves, for instance, remember an ellipse shape has two different radii while a circle has the same radius all around its center. Once you have analyzed and visualized the shape, use the conclusion to select the best matching option from the list provided. Remember, your answer should be present in the list, and express your final answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Thoroughly examine the SVG path element in the first sentence. Note every single coordinate and their sequence. Keep in mind that not all points necessarily form corners of the polygon. Be attentive to path's characteristics like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and the possibility of line segments colliding. Visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions - it could be elaborate or straightforward. Count all individual line sections and identify closed circuits that might suggest a shape. For curved shapes, differentiate between a circle and an ellipse by checking the radii for equality. If both radii are equal it denotes a circle, if not it's an ellipse. Also, remember that a path might return to a point which is not the starting point, still forming a closed shape. Upon analyzing and visualizing the shape, select the most fitting option based on your conclusion from the list provided. Please make sure the selected answer is placed between <answer> and </answer>.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Carefully analyze the SVG path element from the first sentence. Pay close attention to every unique coordinate and their ordered sequence. Note that it's the unique points that determine the corners of the potential polygon - so don't count repeated coordinates as separate corners. Consider the path's distinct characteristics such as intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and evaluate whether any line segments intersect. Make an attempt to visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions, which might be complex or simple. If there's a closed circuit, consider it as a potential shape, and remember that a path might loop back to a non-starting point, still encapsulating a shape. Identify polygons by the number of unique points in the SVG path, which will help in determining the correct geometric shape. For curved paths, infer if it's a circle or an ellipse by checking if both radii are equal (denoting a circle), or they have distinct values (indicating an ellipse). Make sure distinguished shapes forming when there is a consecutive sequence of moves ("M") and lines ("L") to ensure correct shape identification.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided represents a shape that has four endpoints and is formed by connecting those endpoints with straight lines. This indicates that the shape is a quadrilateral. Looking at the coordinates of the endpoints, it can be observed that the shape is not a regular quadrilateral like a rectangle or a square. Instead, it has one pair of opposite sides that are parallel (8.62,89.32 to 87.94,93.98 and 11.17,45.94 to 90.49,50.60), which suggests that it is a kite.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this case, the model misjudges the shape as a kite. While there are four points connected by straight lines, the model incorrectly identified the shape as a kite due to similarities in structure. However, the coordinates do not form a kite but instead form a rectangle due to parallel sides of equal length. This demonstrates that the model does not understand the nuances around each shape that differentiate them from each other specifically. The model needs to refine its understanding of the defining properties of each shape.

<2>
The model's incorrect response of a 'line' indicates that it has failed to identify multiple connected points as separate edges of a shape. Instead, it is interpreting the entire set of coordinates as one continuous straight line. This case further emphasizes that the model is unable to fully grasp the concept of a path of an SVG element representing a geometric shape with multiple sides and straight lines.

<3> 
The model gave the same wrong answer as the previous example: a ‘line’. This shows that the model has difficulty distinguishing between a single straight line and a set of lines that form a shape. In this case, looking at the provided path shows that it could be representing the shape of a rectangle (H), which again has parallel sides of equal length.

<4>  
The model incorrectly identified the shape as a 'kite'. It appears that when the model sees multiple straight lines connecting points, it leans towards a 'kite' as an answer. The issue here is that the model does not identify the correct number of lines forming the shape and their arrangement, further indicating understanding issues surrounding the properties of individual shapes.

From the analysis of these examples, several areas for improvement become evident. 

1. Clearly explaining the nature of the task: While SVG path information is mentioned in the prompt, it does not explicitly instruct the model that it's required to translate SVG paths into geometric shapes. Explicit details will ensure the model understands the relationship between SVG paths, their constituent parts, and their relation to geometric shapes.
2. Understanding geometry and its vocabulary: There are certain terminologies and defining attributes for each geometric shape, the model's understanding and application of these need to be improved for accurate prediction.
3. Incorporate deeper SVG knowledge: The model must understand that a single SVG path may represent more complex shapes by connecting multiple individual line segments, rather than viewing the path only as a continuous straight line.
4. Reinforce the decision-making process: The model should be clearly directed to evaluate the angles, lengths, and relationships between the lines in the SVG path to correctly assess the shape.
5. Make the listing of answer procedure clear: Especially for this type of question, the model needs to be instructed to properly analyze each option before making a final decision.
6. Emphasize verification: The model should cross-verify the chosen shape’s properties with the given SVG coordinates, facilitating a double-check process.

4. Reinforce the decision-making process: The model should be clearly directed to evaluate the angles, lengths, and relationships between the lines in the SVG path to correctly assess the shape.
5. Make the listing of answer procedure clear: Especially for this type of question, the model needs to be instructed to properly analyze each option before making a final decision.
6. Emphasize verification: The model should cross-verify the chosen shape’s properties with the given SVG coordinates, facilitating a double-check process.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Interpret the SVG path element in the first sentence and infer the geometric shape it represents from the options provided. Then, express your answer by indicating the corresponding option.
(2) Analyze the SVG path element in the first sentence, taking into account every coordinate and the direction of the path. Try to visualize a complex geometric shape that this path could form, beyond just a simple line, by considering intersections, turnings, and endpoints. Once you determine the geometric shape, express your answer by selecting the most accurate option from the list provided. At the end, show your answer option by encapsulating it between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Carefully analyze the SVG path element provided in the first sentence. Take into account all coordinates and the direction of the path. Keep both simple and complex geometric shapes in mind. To understand the shape this path represents, you must consider the number of intersections, turnings, and endpoints. Keep in mind the properties of all possible shapes provided on the list, and the differences that distinguish one shape from another, such as between a circle and an ellipse or a triangle and a kite. Once you have visualized the geometric shape, express the shape accurately by choosing the correct option from the list. Cross-verify your choice by ensuring that the properties of the chosen shape match with the provided SVG path element. Finally, encapsulate your selected answer option between <answer> and </answer>.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> In the first sentence, you are provided with an SVG path element. Your task is to deduce the exact geometric shape that this path represents. Carefully analyze the SVG path, paying close attention to all the coordinates and the direction of movement - these are crucial for reconstructing the abstract shape. The path might represent simple or complex geometric shapes, but it's essential to distinguish between a path comprising one single straight line and a path that forms distinct shapes with multiple lines, which could mark the boundaries of a two-dimensional object. 

Take into account every detail - the number of intersections, turns, and endpoints in the path. Consider the distinctive properties of each possible shape provided on the list, such as the difference in properties of a circle and an ellipse or between a triangle and a kite. Use this knowledge to visualize the geometric shape that the path represents.

After visualizing the shape, you have to express the shape accurately by choosing the most suitable option from the provided list. Each option is a different geometric shape, represented by a letter from (A) to (K). First, analyze each option in-depth, comparing its defining properties to those of the visualized shape. Next, choose the one that best matches the path. 

Finally, always cross-verify your choice. Ensure that all the properties of the chosen shape align perfectly with those depicted by the path. Once you have chosen and affirmed your answer, encapsulate the letter of your answer in <answer> and </answer> brackets. 

Note: Each SVG path may represent more complex shapes by connecting multiple individual line segments, rather than viewing the path only as a single continuous straight line. Also, ensure you are respecting the order of the points and the path direction in your answer. 

For instance, if you believe that the SVG path element represents a rectangle, and rectangle is option (H), your final answer should be <answer>(H) rectangle</answer>.  <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Example 1:
   
In this example, the correct answer is a heptagon (B), but the model predicted a triangle (J). It's clear the language model cannot properly interpret SVG path or cannot visualize the imagery of the shape. The prompt may be too complex or requires a level of execution beyond the model's capability. 

2. Example 2:
   
Similar to the first scenario, the model predicted a triangle (J) instead of the correct solution which is a pentagon (G). Again, the model appears to struggle with geometric visualization from SVG path. 

3. Example 3:
   
In this instance, the model incorrectly predicted that the SVG path referred to a line (E), while the correct answer was a kite (D). It’s apparent that the model is oversimplifying the task, reducing the paths to simple lines.

4. Example 4: 

The model, in this example, made the same mistake as before, predicting a line (E) instead of a kite (D). It repeated its error from the previous instance where it chose a simple shape over a complex one. 

Summary:

Conclusively, the model tends to simplify the shapes into lines or triangles, suggesting an issue with complex geometric visualization. It indicates that the current prompt struggles in stimulating the model's ability to decipher complex shapes or fails to cause the model to correlate the SVG paths to the encoded geometric information. 

Areas to improve:
- Geometric Imagery: Current prompt might be amended to induce the model to visualize or interpret geometric aspects more accurately.
- Oversimplification: The prompt might benefit from a more explicit instruction to discourage the model from simplifying the SVG paths.
- Contextual Clues: The prompt may potentially highlight the fact that SVG paths may represent a variety of shapes, not just basic triangles and lines. That might help the model recognize that it needs to consider all potential shapes.
- Enhanced Understanding: The prompt may encourage the model to understand SVG path element structure and its correspondence with geometric shapes.

<1> Example:

Question: Analyzing the SVG path element <path d="M 63.87,16.63 L 66.66,42.93 L 38.28,45.94 L 35.49,19.64 M 35.49,19.64 L 63.87,16.63"/> draws a...
Correct answer: H - rectangle 
Model's answer: J - triangle

Analysis: The SVG path creates a rectangle, not a triangle. It is possible that the model misinterpreted because, the four lines might have been mistaken for forming three edges, akin to a triangle. Additionally, the language model may not fully comprehend SVG paths or be able to effectively evaluate coordinates to discern shapes.

<2> Example:

Question: Analyzing the SVG path element <path d="M 39.65,95.57 A 27.46,27.46 92.15 1,0 41.70,40.68 A 27.46,27.46 92.15 1,0 39.65,95.57"/> draws a...
Correct answer: A - circle
Model's answer: K - ellipse

Analysis: The SVG path provided describes a circle, not an ellipse. Background knowledge of SVG instructions suggests that the path instruction 'A' represents an 'Elliptical Arc Curve', which may lead the model to assume an ellipse. Understandably, a circle is a special case of an ellipse, but the model is unable to discern this subtly.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. The prompt could explicitly request that the language model 'visualize' the SVG path rather than 'analyze', to encourage the correct interpretation of the path.
2. Provide clear distinctions in the prompt between similar shapes (e.g. circle and ellipse, rectangle and square).
3. Include SVG path instructions in the prompt or as a reference to help the model understand 'M', 'L', 'A', etc.
4. Add more clarifications about recognizing a shape based on its properties, like number of sides or angles, instead of relying on the direction and intersections.
5. Specify that the model should take into account the possibility of a shape being a part of another category (e.g. a circle being a special case of an ellipse).
6. Lastly, the prompts should reinforce the understanding that precise accuracy is required when discerning shapes, as even one mistaken identification could lead to a completely wrong answer.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided represents a shape that starts at point (41.00, 42.00), then moves to point (37.00, 32.00), followed by points (41.00, 30.00), (45.00, 32.00), and finally back to the starting point (41.00, 42.00). This sequence of points forms a closed shape with four sides, where the first and last points are the same.

Based on the given coordinates and the nature of the shape described, the shape represented by the SVG path element is a triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.

The model's prediction is: J.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> The SVG path element describes an octagon, but the model predicted it to be a kite. The mistake seems to be because the model does not have the ability to interpret SVG path elements in a geometrically accurate way. Despite having intricate instructions on what to consider, the model lacks the spatial reasoning or shape recognition abilities that would enable it to visualize and identify complex geometric shapes from reading SVG codes.

<2> The SVG path element describes a heptagon, but the model determined it to be a kite. Similar to the first example, the model appears to be unable to visualize and accurately identify more complex geometric shapes from the SVG path element. 

<3> This SVG path element is actually drawing a kite. However, the model parsed the SVG path element as a triangle. This again underscores the model's inability to accurately convert SVG path elements into their corresponding geometric shapes. It seems to struggle particularly with more complex shapes and polygons with more vertices.

In summary, the main issues with the prompt are:

- The prompt assumes the model can interpret SVG path elements to visualize and identify geometric shapes, an ability the model currently does not possess.
- The task requires a high degree of spatial reasoning and shape recognition, something the AI model may not be able to do.
- The prompt might be too detailed and complex for the model to utilize effectively in formulating a correct response.

Improvements based on these issues could include:

- Redesigning the prompt to more accurately reflect the model's abilities. For instance, a question that requires text-based analysis rather than geometric interpretation might be more appropriate.
- Simplifying the task and prompt, removing unnecessary details that the language model cannot utilize.
- Possibly including example responses within the prompt where the model correctly translates SVG path to the geometric shape, thus teaching it through examples.
- Splitting the prompt into more manageable tasks which can be executed in separate stages.

Analyze the SVG path element provided in the first sentence. Rather than simplifying it to a basic form, strive to visualize the complex shape it might represent. Consider every detail - the coordinates, directionality, endpoints, intersections, and turns. The list of possible shapes includes not only simple ones like lines and triangles but also complex ones like circles, ovals, and various polygons. Remember, these shapes have distinctive properties - for instance, the difference between a circle and an ellipse, or between a heptagon and a hexagon or between a triangle and a kite. Make sure to consider these distinctions when analyzing the SVG path element. Your task does not stop at just visualizing the shape. You also need to cross-check whether the properties of the shape that you visualize match with the details provided in the SVG path element. Choose the correct geometric shape from the options and express your answer accordingly. Make sure to encapsulate your answer option between <answer> and </answer>. Keep in mind that this task requires careful thought and detailed analysis, so consider every shape without simplification before finalizing your answer.

This SVG path element <path d="M 41.00,42.00 L 37.00,32.00 L 41.00,30.00 L 45.00,32.00 L 41.00,42.00"/> draws a

(J) triangle

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided represents a shape that starts at point (41.00, 42.00), then moves to point (37.00, 32.00), followed by points (41.00, 30.00), (45.00, 32.00), and finally back to the starting point (41.00, 42.00). This sequence of points forms a closed shape with four sides, where the first and last points are the same.

Based on the given coordinates and the nature of the shape described, the shape represented by the SVG path element is a triangle.

Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: J.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> The SVG path element describes an octagon, but the model predicted it to be a kite. The mistake seems to be because the model does not have the ability to interpret SVG path elements in a geometrically accurate way. Despite having intricate instructions on what to consider, the model lacks the spatial reasoning or shape recognition abilities that would enable it to visualize and identify complex geometric shapes from reading SVG codes.

<2> The SVG path element describes a heptagon, but the model determined it to be a kite. Similar to the first example, the model appears to be unable to visualize and accurately identify more complex geometric shapes from the SVG path element. 

<3> This SVG path element is actually drawing a kite. However, the model parsed the SVG path element as a triangle. This again underscores the model's inability to accurately convert SVG path elements into their corresponding geometric shapes. It seems to struggle particularly with more complex shapes and polygons with more vertices.

In summary, the main issues with the prompt are:

- The prompt assumes the model can interpret SVG path elements to visualize and identify geometric shapes, an ability the model currently does not possess.
- The task requires a high degree of spatial reasoning and shape recognition, something the AI model may not be able to do.
- The prompt might be too detailed and complex for the model to utilize effectively in formulating a correct response.

Improvements based on these issues could include:

- Redesigning the prompt to more accurately reflect the model's abilities. For instance, a question that requires text-based analysis rather than geometric interpretation might be more appropriate.
- Simplifying the task and prompt, removing unnecessary details that the language model cannot utilize.
- Possibly including example responses within the prompt where the model correctly translates SVG path to the geometric shape, thus teaching it through examples.
- Splitting the prompt into more manageable tasks which can be executed in separate stages.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 14.44,11.99 L 76.77,22.48 L 40.71,55.25 M 40.71,55.25 L 14.44,11.99"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>triangle</answer>
Correct label: J
Model's prediction: I.

Reason:
The error could arise from misunderstanding the SVG path syntax. "M" stands for "move to" without drawing anything. "L" means "line to". The model might have got confused by the multiple M commands which usually used to create disjoint pieces of paths. However, in this example, the single path actually forms a triangle, but the model misinterpreted it.

<2>
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 45.00,97.00 L 87.00,78.00 L 80.00,31.00 L 37.00,9.00 L -3.00,46.00 L 9.00,82.00 L 45.00,97.00"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Correct label: C
Model's prediction: D.

Reason:
The SVG path provided represents a hexagon. However, the model incorrectly identified it as a kite. This could be because the coordinates provided might visually result in a shape that could be confused with a kite. Hence, the error might be due to an incorrect interpretation of the coordinates provided in the SVG path.

<3> 
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 41.97,21.34 L 12.23,35.25 M 12.23,35.25 L 4.62,18.98 L 34.36,5.07 L 41.97,21.34"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Correct label: H
Model's prediction: D.

Reason:
It seems the SVG path represents a rectangle, not a kite as predicted by the model. Given that the SVG path instruction does not clearly specify the form of the shape (e.g., straight or curved lines), understanding the shape's true form can be challenging. The model might have been confused by the repeated "M" and "L" instructions leading to misclassification.

<4> 
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 57.33,25.85 A 18.81,18.81 351.25 1,0 20.15,31.57 A 18.81,18.81 351.25 1,0 57.33,25.85"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>(K) ellipse</answer>
Correct label: A
Model's prediction: K.

Reason:
The SVG path is seemingly creating arcs through its "A" commands. When put together, these arcs build a circle, not an ellipse as the model predicted. The error possibly stemmed from the model's confusion between the two similar but distinct geometric shapes.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Be Specific: The prompt could be enhanced by giving more specifics about how to interpret SVG path syntax. 
2. Instruction Clarification: The prompt could include instructions emphasizing that multiple Move "M" commands within a single path can lead to a single geometric shape rather than disjoint outcomes.
3. Shape Differences: Reiterate the differences among similar shapes, like a circle and an ellipse, to help the model differentiate better.
4. Non-Simplistic Approach: The prompt could be clarified to explain that while the shapes must not be simplified, the path instructions like "M", "L" and "A" might need to break down for better understanding.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 14.44,11.99 L 76.77,22.48 L 40.71,55.25 M 40.71,55.25 L 14.44,11.99"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>triangle</answer>
Correct label: J
Model's prediction: I.

Reason:
The error could arise from misunderstanding the SVG path syntax. "M" stands for "move to" without drawing anything. "L" means "line to". The model might have got confused by the multiple M commands which usually used to create disjoint pieces of paths. However, in this example, the single path actually forms a triangle, but the model misinterpreted it.

<2>
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 45.00,97.00 L 87.00,78.00 L 80.00,31.00 L 37.00,9.00 L -3.00,46.00 L 9.00,82.00 L 45.00,97.00"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Correct label: C
Model's prediction: D.

Reason:
The SVG path provided represents a hexagon. However, the model incorrectly identified it as a kite. This could be because the coordinates provided might visually result in a shape that could be confused with a kite. Hence, the error might be due to an incorrect interpretation of the coordinates provided in the SVG path.

<3> 
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 41.97,21.34 L 12.23,35.25 M 12.23,35.25 L 4.62,18.98 L 34.36,5.07 L 41.97,21.34"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Correct label: H
Model's prediction: D.

Reason:
It seems the SVG path represents a rectangle, not a kite as predicted by the model. Given that the SVG path instruction does not clearly specify the form of the shape (e.g., straight or curved lines), understanding the shape's true form can be challenging. The model might have been confused by the repeated "M" and "L" instructions leading to misclassification.

<4> 
Question: This SVG path element <path d="M 57.33,25.85 A 18.81,18.81 351.25 1,0 20.15,31.57 A 18.81,18.81 351.25 1,0 57.33,25.85"/> draws a 
Wrong answer: <answer>(K) ellipse</answer>
Correct label: A
Model's prediction: K.

Reason:
The SVG path is seemingly creating arcs through its "A" commands. When put together, these arcs build a circle, not an ellipse as the model predicted. The error possibly stemmed from the model's confusion between the two similar but distinct geometric shapes.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Be Specific: The prompt could be enhanced by giving more specifics about how to interpret SVG path syntax. 
2. Instruction Clarification: The prompt could include instructions emphasizing that multiple Move "M" commands within a single path can lead to a single geometric shape rather than disjoint outcomes.
3. Shape Differences: Reiterate the differences among similar shapes, like a circle and an ellipse, to help the model differentiate better.
4. Non-Simplistic Approach: The prompt could be clarified to explain that while the shapes must not be simplified, the path instructions like "M", "L" and "A" might need to break down for better understanding.

<START> Analyze the SVG path element in the first sentence. Remember, SVG paths employ several commands, such as "M" for moving the pen without inking, "L" to draw a line and "A" for an arc.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In the first question, the model picked the kite over the actual correct answer, the heptagon. This could be because complex shapes such as kites, heptagons, and hexagons can look similar when visualized from the given SVG path element. The prompt might fail to guide the language model to distinguish these shapes accurately. Moreover, the model might not fully understand the structure of SVG path element to correctly predict the shape.

<2>
In the second question, the model chose ellipse instead of the correct answer circle. It's dominating because the ARC command "A" was used in the path element. However, the model wrongly interpreted the values for the axes of the ellipse (which are the same, making it a circle) leading to the wrong conclusion. The instruction of the prompt might not be clear enough in this regard, considering the fine difference between a circle and an ellipse within the SVG command context.

<3>
The same problem occurred in the third question, where the model chose a kite instead of the correct answer, a hexagon. It suggests the model may have struggled in understanding SVG path commands leading to a misinterpretation of the shape that the square brackets create.

<4> 
In the fourth example, the model again chose kite over the correct answer pentagon. This continual selection of the 'kite' option may suggest the current prompt leans too much towards considering quadrilateral shapes over others. The model’s struggle to accurately interpret the SVG path data for more complex shapes may be due to the lack of explicit instructions in the prompt regarding how to distinguish these from each other.

Improvements:
1. Decision-making process: Encourage the model to clearly outline its decision-making process in distinguishing between similar shapes, such as a kite, pentagon, and hexagon.
2. SVG Commands Understanding: Make it clear that the model needs to understand SVG commands and their nuances to make accurate shape predictions. For instance, in the case of "A" command, if two radius values are the same, it's a circle not an ellipse.
3. Shape Properties: Focus more on the properties of the shapes - their sides, vertices, and symmetry. This could help in differentiation between similar shapes.   
4. No Bias: Ensure that the model doesn't lean towards one shape type over others, as it seemed to prefer the kite option in these examples.
5. Explanation: Ask the language model to explain the analysis of the SVG path and how this leads to the conclusion about the shape.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided represents a kite. 

<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: G
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
In the first question, the model picked the kite over the actual correct answer, the heptagon. This could be because complex shapes such as kites, heptagons, and hexagons can look similar when visualized from the given SVG path element. The prompt might fail to guide the language model to distinguish these shapes accurately. Moreover, the model might not fully understand the structure of SVG path element to correctly predict the shape.

<2>
In the second question, the model chose ellipse instead of the correct answer circle. It's dominating because the ARC command "A" was used in the path element. However, the model wrongly interpreted the values for the axes of the ellipse (which are the same, making it a circle) leading to the wrong conclusion. The instruction of the prompt might not be clear enough in this regard, considering the fine difference between a circle and an ellipse within the SVG command context.

<3>
The same problem occurred in the third question, where the model chose a kite instead of the correct answer, a hexagon. It suggests the model may have struggled in understanding SVG path commands leading to a misinterpretation of the shape that the square brackets create.

<4> 
In the fourth example, the model again chose kite over the correct answer pentagon. This continual selection of the 'kite' option may suggest the current prompt leans too much towards considering quadrilateral shapes over others. The model’s struggle to accurately interpret the SVG path data for more complex shapes may be due to the lack of explicit instructions in the prompt regarding how to distinguish these from each other.

Improvements:
1. Decision-making process: Encourage the model to clearly outline its decision-making process in distinguishing between similar shapes, such as a kite, pentagon, and hexagon.
2. SVG Commands Understanding: Make it clear that the model needs to understand SVG commands and their nuances to make accurate shape predictions. For instance, in the case of "A" command, if two radius values are the same, it's a circle not an ellipse.
3. Shape Properties: Focus more on the properties of the shapes - their sides, vertices, and symmetry. This could help in differentiation between similar shapes.   
4. No Bias: Ensure that the model doesn't lean towards one shape type over others, as it seemed to prefer the kite option in these examples.
5. Explanation: Ask the language model to explain the analysis of the SVG path and how this leads to the conclusion about the shape.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: Analyze the SVG path element and infer what geometric shape the points represent when connected in sequence. This SVG path element <path d="M 83.34,41.82 L 22.52,69.63 M 22.52,69.63 L 7.52,36.82 M 7.52,36.82 L 68.34,9.01 L 83.34,41.82"/> draws a...
Wrong Answer: <answer>(J)</answer> triangle
Correct label: H
Reason: The SVG path indicates a number of sequential points but not all of the points are being connected to form the shape. The model incorrectly inferred a triangle based on a subset of the total points. 

<2> 
Question: Analyze the SVG path element and infer what geometric shape the points represent when connected in sequence. This SVG path element <path d="M 74.18,59.65 L 50.54,71.20 M 50.54,71.20 L 38.08,45.69 M 38.08,45.69 L 61.71,34.14 M 61.71,34.14 L 74.18,59.65"/> draws a...
Wrong Answer: <answer>(D)</answer> kite
Correct label: H
Reason: The misclassification again likely stems from the model looking at isolated segments within the path rather than considering all points in sequence as outlined in the prompt. Treating the entire SVG path as one comprehensive shape might have allowed the correct identification of the shape as a rectangle (H).

<3> 
Question: Analyze the SVG path element and infer what geometric shape the points represent when connected in sequence. This SVG path element <path d="M 57.00,57.00 A 5.00,5.00 0.00 1,0 47.00,57.00 A 5.00,5.00 0.00 1,0 57.00,57.00"/> draws a...
Wrong Answer: <answer>(I)</answer> sector
Correct label: A
Reason: The model seems to have attached too much importance to the 'A' command which draws arcs, thus leading to the identification of the figure as a "sector". However, given the specific parameters in the command, it actually spells out a complete circle which the model failed to identify.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(D)</answer> kite
Correct label: B
Reason: The model appears to identify early matches, such as a kite shape in this instance, rather than evaluating all the points before predicting an answer.

Evaluation:
Despite the explicit prompt to consider all points and evaluate the entire sequence in the SVG path, the model seems to be paying undue attention to isolated segments. Furthermore, it may be getting tripped over specific commands in the SVG path.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Emphasize the importance of looking at the entire picture, possibly by adding a warning about early matches.
2. Provide clarification about how to interpret SVG paths, focusing not only on 'M' and 'L' but also on other commands such as 'A' for arcs.
3. Remind the model to consider the list of available options before making an answer prediction.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: Analyze the SVG path element and infer what geometric shape the points represent when connected in sequence. This SVG path element <path d="M 83.34,41.82 L 22.52,69.63 M 22.52,69.63 L 7.52,36.82 M 7.52,36.82 L 68.34,9.01 L 83.34,41.82"/> draws a...
Wrong Answer: <answer>(J)</answer> triangle
Correct label: H
Reason: The SVG path indicates a number of sequential points but not all of the points are being connected to form the shape. The model incorrectly inferred a triangle based on a subset of the total points. 

<2> 
Question: Analyze the SVG path element and infer what geometric shape the points represent when connected in sequence. This SVG path element <path d="M 74.18,59.65 L 50.54,71.20 M 50.54,71.20 L 38.08,45.69 M 38.08,45.69 L 61.71,34.14 M 61.71,34.14 L 74.18,59.65"/> draws a...
Wrong Answer: <answer>(D)</answer> kite
Correct label: H
Reason: The misclassification again likely stems from the model looking at isolated segments within the path rather than considering all points in sequence as outlined in the prompt. Treating the entire SVG path as one comprehensive shape might have allowed the correct identification of the shape as a rectangle (H).

<3> 
Question: Analyze the SVG path element and infer what geometric shape the points represent when connected in sequence. This SVG path element <path d="M 57.00,57.00 A 5.00,5.00 0.00 1,0 47.00,57.00 A 5.00,5.00 0.00 1,0 57.00,57.00"/> draws a...
Wrong Answer: <answer>(I)</answer> sector
Correct label: A
Reason: The model seems to have attached too much importance to the 'A' command which draws arcs, thus leading to the identification of the figure as a "sector". However, given the specific parameters in the command, it actually spells out a complete circle which the model failed to identify.

Wrong Answer: <answer>(D)</answer> kite
Correct label: B
Reason: The model appears to identify early matches, such as a kite shape in this instance, rather than evaluating all the points before predicting an answer.

Evaluation:
Despite the explicit prompt to consider all points and evaluate the entire sequence in the SVG path, the model seems to be paying undue attention to isolated segments. Furthermore, it may be getting tripped over specific commands in the SVG path.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Emphasize the importance of looking at the entire picture, possibly by adding a warning about early matches.
2. Provide clarification about how to interpret SVG paths, focusing not only on 'M' and 'L' but also on other commands such as 'A' for arcs.
3. Remind the model to consider the list of available options before making an answer prediction.

gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

1. Ambiguity in Analyzing SVG Path: The current prompt asks the model to infer the geometric shape from the SVG path. However, it appears the model misinterpreted the SVG path and subsequently misidentified the shape. The SVG coordinate points clearly imply a heptagon, but the model inaccurately inferred a kite instead. The instructions given for analyzation might not be explicitly clear or detailed enough for correct inference. 

2. Overemphasis on Shape Resolution: The current prompt puts heavy emphasis on the resemblance of the shape. This might have led the model to focus on how closely the interpreted shape resembles a standard geometric shape, which can lead to incorrect inferences if the resulting path depicts a geometrically accurate but visually skewed version of a particular shape.

3. Lack of Clarity on Sequence of Points: The prompt instructs the consideration of sequence of points, but it might not clarify enough on how to properly understand the sequence of points within the SVG path. The model might have incorrectly analyzed the sequence, resulting in the misidentification of the shape.

4. Absence of Instructions on M and L Commands: The prompt mentions M and L commands in SVG but does not clear their pertinence in inferring the shape. Misinterpretation of these commands may lead to a wrong prediction.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Elaborate on SVG Path Analysis: Make sure the instructions clearly explain how to accurately analyze SVG paths. 

2. Detail Shape-Inference Mechanism: Provide specific instructions about how geometric shapes could vary and differ in SVG paths from their standard representations that we typically visualize.

3. Clarify Sequence of Points: Provide more detailed instructions on interpreting and understanding the sequence of points within the SVG path.

4. Explain M and L Commands: Describe how to appropriately interpret and use the 'M' and 'L' commands in SVG for predicting the shape.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reason for Model Failure: For the first example, the model misinterpreted the SVG path as forming two arcs based on the 'A' (arc) character in the raw SVG code. The way the prompt was structured did not specifically instruct the model to analyze arcs to determine if they form a complete circle. 

<2> Reason for Model Failure: For the second example, the model incorrectly identified the shape in the SVG path as a heptagon (7-sided polygon) whereas it was indeed a hexagon (6-sided polygon). This indicates that the model encountered difficulty accurately interpreting the number of vertices specified by the `M` and `L` commands in the SVG path.

<3> Reason for Model Failure: For the third example, the model interpreted the shape as a kite which might have been because it recognized four lines in the SVG path instructions. This suggests that the model struggled with correctly identifying shapes, possibly due to complexity or overlapping in the SVG path.

<4> Reason for Model Failure: In the fourth example, the model again incorrectly predicted the shape as a kite. It seems to struggle with paths that have more intricate or complex sequences of points, suggesting an issue with the model's ability to count or delineate vertices in SVG paths.

Based on these incorrect responses, the following improvements could be made to the prompt:
1. Clarification regarding the analysis of arcs: The prompt should specifically instruct the model to analyze arcs and check if they complete 360 degrees to form a circle. This can be outlined in the prompt, for instance, "Consider whether any arc command ('A') in the SVG path forms a complete or partial circle."
2. Enhanced explicit instructions for vertices analysis: Include instructions for the model to count vertices identified by the `M` and `L` path commands to determine the number of sides in a geometric shape.
3. Handling complexity in SVG paths: The wording of the prompt should address complexity and overlapping points in SVG paths to prevent misinterpretation.
4. Precision in identifying shapes: The model should be guided to be more accurate in identifying complex shapes, perhaps by examining the lengths and angles between lines, not just the number of lines.
5. Request for detailed reasoning or step-by-step analysis: Ask the model to provide a step by step analysis of the drawing process, which might help it make a more accurate prediction.
Overall, the model needs to be stronger at interpreting SVG paths and understanding how different path commands might interact to form a geometric shape.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In this example, the SVG path provided describes line segments connected in some way. However, it's not clear how these line segments form any specific shape. The language model made an educated guess based on the information given, but in this case, its guess of a kite (D) was incorrect. The correct answer was a rectangle (H).

Reason for the wrong answer:
- Lack of context: The language model does not have any understanding or context for SVG paths, especially when it comes to interpreting and visualizing them to identify shapes. It lacks the capability to understand the numerical values used in the SVG path code concerning lengths and angles of lines.
- Unspecific directions: The prompt asks the model to make an "educated guess," but this is vague since the model lacks a way to make an educated guess in this context.

<2>
In this example, again, the SVG code is given, and the model is required to identify the shape it draws. The model incorrectly predicted the shape to be a kite (D), while the correct answer was a pentagon (G).

Reason for the wrong answer:
- Not enough information: Just like in the previous example, the model does not have enough information or context to correctly interpret the SVG path.
- Lack of understanding: The prompt might not be clear enough for the model, and it does not provide specific instructions that would help it to understand the SVG path's numerical values and relate them to geometry.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Further context: The prompt could provide more context about SVG paths and how they relate to various shapes.
2. More specific instructions: Rather than asking for an "educated guess," the prompt could be more explicit about the kind of analysis the model needs to perform.
3. Handling complexity: The prompt could break down the task into simpler sub-tasks. For example, asking the model to first determine the number of points or lines, and then identify shapes based on this information.
4. Clearer expectations: The prompt should be clearer about what is expected in the response. Are exact shape matches required, or is the goal to find the closest possible match?
5. The prompt could be optimized based on the model's capabilities. If the model lacks the ability to visualize or interpret HTML/SVG code, then it might make sense to revise the prompt accordingly.

The model's response is: 
This SVG path element draws a kite. 
<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: G
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
In this example, the SVG path provided describes line segments connected in some way. However, it's not clear how these line segments form any specific shape. The language model made an educated guess based on the information given, but in this case, its guess of a kite (D) was incorrect. The correct answer was a rectangle (H).

Reason for the wrong answer:
- Lack of context: The language model does not have any understanding or context for SVG paths, especially when it comes to interpreting and visualizing them to identify shapes. It lacks the capability to understand the numerical values used in the SVG path code concerning lengths and angles of lines.
- Unspecific directions: The prompt asks the model to make an "educated guess," but this is vague since the model lacks a way to make an educated guess in this context.

<2>
In this example, again, the SVG code is given, and the model is required to identify the shape it draws. The model incorrectly predicted the shape to be a kite (D), while the correct answer was a pentagon (G).

Reason for the wrong answer:
- Not enough information: Just like in the previous example, the model does not have enough information or context to correctly interpret the SVG path.
- Lack of understanding: The prompt might not be clear enough for the model, and it does not provide specific instructions that would help it to understand the SVG path's numerical values and relate them to geometry.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Further context: The prompt could provide more context about SVG paths and how they relate to various shapes.
2. More specific instructions: Rather than asking for an "educated guess," the prompt could be more explicit about the kind of analysis the model needs to perform.
3. Handling complexity: The prompt could break down the task into simpler sub-tasks. For example, asking the model to first determine the number of points or lines, and then identify shapes based on this information.
4. Clearer expectations: The prompt should be clearer about what is expected in the response. Are exact shape matches required, or is the goal to find the closest possible match?
5. The prompt could be optimized based on the model's capabilities. If the model lacks the ability to visualize or interpret HTML/SVG code, then it might make sense to revise the prompt accordingly.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. Wrong Example 1:
The model mistook the SVG path for a 'kite' but it was a 'heptagon'. The mistake can be attributed to misinterpretation of the SVG path data. It took only the sharp angular points into consideration without recognizing the total number of points, which fits the description of a kite but not a heptagon. The prompt didn't sufficiently emphasize the need to count the points or lines that can better determine the shape.

Reasons:
 - Incomplete interpretation of path data: The model possibly took only the major angle points into consideration in the SVG path data and not the actual number of points or lines that are necessary to form a heptagon.
 - Misunderstanding of specific shape attributes: The heptagon shape has seven sides, but the model predicted the shape to be a kite which normally has fewer sides (four sides).

2. Wrong Example 2:
Again, the model identified the SVG path as a 'kite', when it is actually a 'heptagon'. The incorrect interpretation of SVG path data leads the model to wrongly identify the shape. The same issues identified in scenario 1 are also evident here.

Reasons:
- Misinterpretation of SVG path data: Similar to the first example, the model used only the primary angle points to determine the shape, rather than considering the total number of distinct points or lines that create a heptagon.
- Ignorance of specific shape attributes: As before, it appears that the model lacks understanding of what constitutes a 'heptagon', hence mistakenly identifying the shape as a 'kite'.

Prompt Improvement Recommendations:
- Prompt Enhancement: Encourage the model to count and consider the total number of points, rather than only examining sharp angles. This could potentially help it predict a wide range of polygonal shapes accurately.
- Vocabulary Enhancement: Prompt should demand a better understanding of shape attributes (like number of sides).
- Clarity: The prompt could clearly signify the importance of considering all data points in the SVG path or even the specific attributes of shapes.
- Example Illustrations: Providing some examples of how to interpret SVG data could make it easier for the model to understand how to determine shapes from SVG paths.

Answer: "<answer>(K) ellipse</answer>."
Correct Label: (A) circle

Reasons: The model has misunderstood the given SVG path. It interprets this as drawing two arcs, leading to the conclusion it is an ellipse. However, the SVG forms a perfect circle, which can be difficult to discern without an understanding of SVG paths.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: Determine the shape drawn by the SVG path element "<path d="M 34.08,19.65 L 43.45,30.98 L 38.19,35.33 L 28.82,24.00 L 26.80,25.67 L 24.63,13.16 L 36.11,17.98 M 36.11,17.98 L 34.08,19.65"/>."
Answer: "<answer>(C) hexagon</answer>."
Correct Label: (B) heptagon

Reasons: The model tries to determine the shape based on the number of points, but it gets the count wrong. It appears to be misreading the SVG path data. The 'M' and 'L' commands indicating move and draw line, but it seems not able to accurately translate these into respective points and lines, which leads it to wrongly predict as hexagon when the answer is a heptagon.

How to Improve the Prompt:

1. Make it clear that the model must understand SVG paths: The command letters 'M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A' and 'Z' in an SVG path string have specific meanings which are important to consider in order to recognize the shape created.
2. Request visual interpretation: If understanding SVG path strings is beyond the model's capabilities, another approach could be asking the model to imagine or visualize the shape described by the path, which may give a more accurate result.
3. Encourage more careful counting: The model needs to carefully count the number of points or lines described in the path element, especially when the path is complex.
4. Allow for uncertainty: Sometimes, the path might not directly infer the shape. In these cases, the model should be instructed to indicate when it cannot ascertain a definite answer, rather than guessing incorrectly.
5. Clarify the meaning of "educated guess": Make it clear that an "educated guess" requires more than just counting lines or points but includes a deeper understanding of SVG paths.

The 'M' and 'L' commands indicating move and draw line, but it seems not able to accurately translate these into respective points and lines, which leads it to wrongly predict as hexagon when the answer is a heptagon.

How to Improve the Prompt:

1. Make it clear that the model must understand SVG paths: The command letters 'M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A' and 'Z' in an SVG path string have specific meanings which are important to consider in order to recognize the shape created.
2. Request visual interpretation: If understanding SVG path strings is beyond the model's capabilities, another approach could be asking the model to imagine or visualize the shape described by the path, which may give a more accurate result.
3. Encourage more careful counting: The model needs to carefully count the number of points or lines described in the path element, especially when the path is complex.
4. Allow for uncertainty: Sometimes, the path might not directly infer the shape. In these cases, the model should be instructed to indicate when it cannot ascertain a definite answer, rather than guessing incorrectly.
5. Clarify the meaning of "educated guess": Make it clear that an "educated guess" requires more than just counting lines or points but includes a deeper understanding of SVG paths.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The model interprets the SVG path and outlines the commands used. However, it ultimately misidentifies the shape. This is due to the model counting only 'L' commands and not considering the actual plotting of points that form a distinct shape. It could also be a misunderstanding of how lines form shapes when they connect in a certain order, manually or automatically by closing a loop. 

<2>
Similar to the first example, the model only focuses on the number of 'L' commands in the SVG path and does not consider how the lines form a shape. The model predicts the shape to be a line, however, the SVG path draws a kite when the points are connected, indicating that the model has limited understanding of shapes formed from SVG lines or points.

<3>
The model again mainly focuses on the number of 'L' commands and reiterates that they correspond to straight lines without noting the order and connection of these lines. Furthermore, no emphasis is placed on the 'M' commands which serve to move the 'pen' to a new location without drawing a line. This points to a lack of understanding of how 'M' and 'L' commands together form a path. As a result, the model incorrectly predicts the shape as a triangle instead of a kite.

The prompt could potentially be improved in the following ways:

1. More emphasis could be put on how the SVG commands work together to form a path. The current prompt essentially puts all commands on equal footing, which seem to cause confusion for the model. The model needs a better understanding of how commands form a path, and how a path forms a specific shape.
2. Include instruction for the model to visualize the path by assessing the interplay of the commands rather than solely counting them.
3. The instructions can push the model to cross-verify with the options provided. For example, even if the model initially guesses the shape as 'line', it should reconsider when the option is not available in the multiple choice.
4. The prompt could better emphasize that a "shape" implies an enclosed space, which could help prevent incorrect predictions like 'line'.
5. Add specificity on how to deduce shapes from line connections and the significance of the 'M' command on influencing the overall path and hence the shape.
6. Additional hints for enhancing the model's educated guessing criteria can be included. For instance, consider how commands interact or how changing one point can alter the shape identification.

To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this instance, the model interprets two 'A' (elliptical arc) commands as an indicator for an ellipse, which leads it to incorrectly choose option K. However, the SVG given was actually creating a circle. This mistake makes it evident that the model doesn't have a profound understanding of how various SVG path commands, particularly the elliptical arc command, contribute in forming a particular shape. Adjustments to the prompt should consider emphasizing on the technicalities of SVG path formation.

<2> 
In the second example, the model falsely identifies three 'L' commands (line-to) as forming a line, when they are in fact forming a triangle. Once again, the model is demonstrating a problem with understanding how the SVG path commands contribute to forming the shape. The presence of multiple 'L' commands should not directly translate to a line but should rather prompt the model to count the number of distinct points or lines drawn to infer the appropriate shape. This suggests that the instructions regarding counting points or lines were not clear or specific enough.

<3>
In the third example, the model confuses the shape with a kite instead of the correct shape, which is a hexagon. Despite the presence of multiple 'L' commands that connect various points, the model fails to correctly identify the shape. This underlines the need to incorporate more explicit instructions to consider the arrangement and connectivity of the points formed by the 'L' commands. Counting only the number of line commands or points is not sufficient; the model should also consider how these points are connected to form a specific shape.

Based on the above analysis, improvements can be made in the following aspects:

1. The model needs specific instructions to better understand how SVG path commands indicate specific shapes. Inform the model that the presence of a specific command doesn't imply a particular shape outrightly. The 'A' command doesn't always form an ellipse and multiple 'L' commands do not necessarily form a line.

2. Instructions to count points can be misunderstood as counting the number of 'L' commands. Enhance the clarity of such instructions to differentiate between points and commands, and emphasize the importance of considering how these points are connected.

3. There is a need to instruct the language model about an educated guess. Rather than just considering individual SVG commands or points, it should also evaluate their arrangements and connection patterns to inform its guesses.

4. Define uncertainty better. There seems to be no provided guideline on what level of uncertainty warrants not providing an answer. Providing an uncertainty threshold can help.

5. Clarify that 'L' command connects two points with a straight line and depending upon the arrangement of these lines different shapes can be formed.

response:
<START> Given the SVG path element provided, your mission is to precisely identify the shape it represents. It is essential to understand how different SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') shape the outcome. Remember, not all 'A' commands create an ellipse, and multiple 'L' commands do not always form a line. The aesthetic of the shape is determined by the arrangement and connectivity of these points and lines, not just their count. Therefore, when analyzing the path, identify how many distinct points and lines there are but also contemplate how they come together to make the shape. 

An educated guess should dissect the pattern of SVG commands and their specific details rather than merely counting points. If despite your analysis, the shape isn't evident, state your uncertainty clearly. Such uncertain situations may arise when the connectivity of points doesn't clearly align with any of the options provided. Rather than forcing an incorrect prediction, acknowledge the ambiguity.

In conclusion, share the answer you deduce from your understanding of SVG commands and the displayed path. Don't forget to include the answer option flanked by <answer> and </answer> tags, even if you encounter uncertainty. Remember, an 'L' command lays a straight line between two points but the pattern these lines form can vary broadly, from triangles to hexagons, depending on the other SVG paths in the data. Your aim is that your understanding of SVG commands and paths, not assumptions, guides your answer.

Now, consider the SVG path included and identify the shape it forms or express your uncertainty if the shape is non-definite amongst the options. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Reason:
This wrong answer originates from the model's reliance on the 'A' command in forming its conclusion. It interprets 'A' command as forming an ellipse. However, the 'A' command indicates an arc of an elliptical path in SVG and does not necessarily mean the shape formed is an ellipse. This shows a gap in the model's understanding of SVG path commands.

<2> 
Reason:
Here, the model correctly identifies that the 'L' commands are responsible for the formation of a shape. However, it incorrectly identifies that shape as a kite. This could be due to the model's struggle to translate SVG commands into a clear visual of the produced shape. For a human, it's evident that the sequence of points produces a rectangle (or rhombus), but the model might have miscounted points or misidentified the shape due to the way the commands were run.

<3> 
Reason:
This error repeats the problem found in the first example. Again, the model infers from the 'A' command that the shape is, therefore, an ellipse, which is not the case given that the SVG path commands form a circle.

<4> 
Reason:
Similar to the second example, the model identifies the shape based on 'L' commands but fails to translate it into the correct shape (a kite). Again, it might be due to difficulties visualizing the end result of these sequential points. In this prompt, the model interprets the sequence as a line rather than a kite.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Provide Clearer Understanding of SVG Commands: The model seems to struggle with the interpretation of SVG commands, especially 'A'. It should be clarified that the 'A' command represents arcs of an elliptical path and does not necessarily define the entire shape. 

2. Improve Visualizing Capability: Some errors result from the model's inability to visualize the sequential points into a clear shape, leading to incorrect identification like in examples 2 and 4.

3. Encourage Comprehensive Analysis: The prompt should encourage the model to engage in a more comprehensive analysis of SVG commands, including a better system of counting points and interpreting line sequences.

4. Enhance Uncertainty Handling: If the shape cannot be unquestionably identified through interpretation of the SVG paths, the model should lean towards acknowledging the uncertain prediction rather than guessing erroneously.

5. Expand Command Understanding: Explain explicitly in the prompt that paths can be open (not forming a complete shape) or closed (forming a complete shape). This is vital in interpreting shapes like 'ellipse' or 'circle'. 

6. Examples: Provide examples of how specific SVG commands correspond to different shapes to help guide the model's understanding.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reasoning:
In the first example, the model interprets the SVG commands and their associated data points and chooses the option for a Line. However, the correct response to the prompt is Hexagon (C). This wrong response illustrates that the model has trouble visualizing paths comprised of multiple lines as a single, closed shape as per the SVG rules. Even though there are multiple 'L' commands, this does not necessarily mean that the final shape is a line. The model also fails to predict the shape based on the number of unique points.

<2> Reasoning:
In the second example, the model again interprets the SVG path commands and concludes the shape to be a Triangle, but the correct shape is a Rectangle. The confusion arises due to the model misunderstanding the 'M' command which signifies the start of a new sub-path. The mistake again underscores the model's difficulty in correlating multiple 'M' points to form a closed shape other than a triangle or line.

<3> Reasoning:
In the third example, the model again fails to predict the correct shape, a Rectangle, and instead predicts a Pentagon. This suggests that the model may be mistakenly associating each 'L' command as a new point of the shape, rather than interpreting the entire string of SVG commands as a whole to identify the outlined shape.

Improvements:
1. Clarify in the prompt that the SVG commands should be interpreted as a whole to form a closed shape, rather than each 'M' and 'L' command creating a new subshape (e.g., line or triangle).
2. Stress the importance of "enclosed space" in defining a shape and mention that lines or points should not be confused with identification of complete shapes.
3. Provide guidance on interpreting the 'M' and 'L' commands not as individual lines but as points creating an outline of the shape.
4. The prompt should mention that the number of points are not necessarily equivalent to the number of vertices in the shape, for example a rectangle can have more than four points but still remains a rectangle.
5. The model should be encouraged to make guesses based on expected attributes of the shape (e.g., closed figure, number of sides) from certain command combinations rather than making independent judgments for each path command.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(G) pentagon</answer>

The correct label is: H
The model's prediction is: G.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Reasoning:
In the first example, the model interprets the SVG commands and their associated data points and chooses the option for a Line. However, the correct response to the prompt is Hexagon (C). This wrong response illustrates that the model has trouble visualizing paths comprised of multiple lines as a single, closed shape as per the SVG rules. Even though there are multiple 'L' commands, this does not necessarily mean that the final shape is a line. The model also fails to predict the shape based on the number of unique points.

<2> Reasoning:
In the second example, the model again interprets the SVG path commands and concludes the shape to be a Triangle, but the correct shape is a Rectangle. The confusion arises due to the model misunderstanding the 'M' command which signifies the start of a new sub-path. The mistake again underscores the model's difficulty in correlating multiple 'M' points to form a closed shape other than a triangle or line.

<3> Reasoning:
In the third example, the model again fails to predict the correct shape, a Rectangle, and instead predicts a Pentagon. This suggests that the model may be mistakenly associating each 'L' command as a new point of the shape, rather than interpreting the entire string of SVG commands as a whole to identify the outlined shape.

Improvements:
1. Clarify in the prompt that the SVG commands should be interpreted as a whole to form a closed shape, rather than each 'M' and 'L' command creating a new subshape (e.g., line or triangle).
2. Stress the importance of "enclosed space" in defining a shape and mention that lines or points should not be confused with identification of complete shapes.
3. Provide guidance on interpreting the 'M' and 'L' commands not as individual lines but as points creating an outline of the shape.
4. The prompt should mention that the number of points are not necessarily equivalent to the number of vertices in the shape, for example a rectangle can have more than four points but still remains a rectangle.
5. The model should be encouraged to make guesses based on expected attributes of the shape (e.g., closed figure, number of sides) from certain command combinations rather than making independent judgments for each path command.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the model had trouble identifying the proper shape on the basis of commanded points. The SVG path has distinct movements which outline a kite, not a triangle. The two triangles, formed by points, seem to have confused the model.

<2> The same difficulty occurred in the second example, where the model counted the points and concluded it is a pentagon. However, it failed to understand the interconnectedness and "direction" of the lines. This highlights the challenge of the model in recreating an accurate mental representation of the SVG directive.

<3> In the third example, the model incorrectly identified the shape as a triangle. The commands consist of 'M' and 'L', which are indicative of starting points and line drawings respectively. The SVG path suggests a rectangle but the model overlooks that because it seems to focus more on the number of points rather than considering how these points connect together to form a shape.

The following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. Emphasize on not just counting the points, but also interpreting their interconnections. Make it clear that the order, direction, and connection of the points matter as much as their quantity.
2. Provide more specific instructions about understanding the formation of the shapes. This could involve asking it to think about how changes in a shape might affect the number and order of points required to represent it.
3. Highlight that the SVG path not only contains instructions on the creation of lines and points, but also includes their directions and the way they should be connected.
4. Encourage the model to take into account previous 'M' movements in the command sequence while interpreting subsequent 'L' line commands. This will assist in creating a comprehensive picture of the shape.
5. Encourage the model to consider symmetry and repetition within the SVG commands as these are often clues to the shape being formed. 
6. Because the prompt focuses heavily on 'M' and 'L' commands, the model could be missing how other commands like 'H', 'V', 'C', etc., significantly contribute to the shape's outline. Strive for a more balanced emphasis or provide examples of how various commands can change the shape's form.
7. Ask the model to provide a step-by-step analysis of its thought process to foster better debugging of its reasoning methodology.
8. Lastly, the prompt could provide a mini-guide on how to interpret common shapes from SVG paths, like how a circle might look compared to a line or rectangle. While this might not cover all possibilities, it will give the model a good starting point for making logical deductions.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The given SVG path element outlines a shape that starts at point (23.33, 42.35), then moves to point (22.72, 41.71), followed by a line to point (7.96, 55.69). From there, it continues to point (8.56, 56.33) and finally connects back to the starting point (23.33, 42.35).

Based on the provided commands and points, the shape outlined is a triangle.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(J) triangle</answer>.

The correct label is: H
The model's prediction is: J.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the first example, the model had trouble identifying the proper shape on the basis of commanded points. The SVG path has distinct movements which outline a kite, not a triangle. The two triangles, formed by points, seem to have confused the model.

<2> The same difficulty occurred in the second example, where the model counted the points and concluded it is a pentagon. However, it failed to understand the interconnectedness and "direction" of the lines. This highlights the challenge of the model in recreating an accurate mental representation of the SVG directive.

<3> In the third example, the model incorrectly identified the shape as a triangle. The commands consist of 'M' and 'L', which are indicative of starting points and line drawings respectively. The SVG path suggests a rectangle but the model overlooks that because it seems to focus more on the number of points rather than considering how these points connect together to form a shape.

The following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. Emphasize on not just counting the points, but also interpreting their interconnections. Make it clear that the order, direction, and connection of the points matter as much as their quantity.
2. Provide more specific instructions about understanding the formation of the shapes. This could involve asking it to think about how changes in a shape might affect the number and order of points required to represent it.
3. Highlight that the SVG path not only contains instructions on the creation of lines and points, but also includes their directions and the way they should be connected.
4. Encourage the model to take into account previous 'M' movements in the command sequence while interpreting subsequent 'L' line commands. This will assist in creating a comprehensive picture of the shape.
5. Encourage the model to consider symmetry and repetition within the SVG commands as these are often clues to the shape being formed. 
6. Because the prompt focuses heavily on 'M' and 'L' commands, the model could be missing how other commands like 'H', 'V', 'C', etc., significantly contribute to the shape's outline. Strive for a more balanced emphasis or provide examples of how various commands can change the shape's form.
7. Ask the model to provide a step-by-step analysis of its thought process to foster better debugging of its reasoning methodology.
8. Lastly, the prompt could provide a mini-guide on how to interpret common shapes from SVG paths, like how a circle might look compared to a line or rectangle. While this might not cover all possibilities, it will give the model a good starting point for making logical deductions.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1> 

Question: <path d="M 66.80,92.60 A 28.15,28.15 64.71 1,0 42.74,41.70 A 28.15,28.15 64.71 1,0 66.80,92.60"/> draws a 

Wrong Answer: (K) ellipse

The model interpreted the SVG path element to represent an ellipse. The reason behind this could potentially be due to the interpretation of the 'A' command which is related to elliptical arc curves. Even though the given path actually forms a circle, the model may have over-thought the instruction to consider how "altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape". It could have focused too much on the 'A' command and failed to consider the overall description and values that shape the final form into a circle.

<2> 

Question: <path d="M 41.00,43.00 L 37.00,34.00 L 41.00,33.00 L 45.00,34.00 L 41.00,43.00"/> draws a 

Wrong Answer: (J) triangle

For this question, the model interpreted the SVG path as a triangle. This could be due to the presence of three clear 'L' (line) commands after the initial 'M' (move to) command. However, the model didn’t take into account that the last point 41.00,43.00 returns back to the start, making four points in total which construct a kite rather than a triangle.

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Clearer Explanation: The prompt can include clearer explanations or examples of how different commands form different shapes in SVG path elements.

2. Deciphering Complex Paths: The prompt needs to emphasize the systematic breakdown of more complex paths for the proper understanding of the formed shape.

3. Handling Alternative Interpretations: The prompt should outline better how the model should prioritize different commands especially when multiple could apply.

4. Shape Identification: Rather than focusing solely on how commands and individual points influence the final shape, the prompt could also include guidance on identifying common characteristics or features of different shapes.

5. Complete Path Evaluation: The prompt should stress the importance of evaluating the entire SVG path and taking into account all commands and points before reaching a conclusion.

6. Emphasize closed paths: Include guidance on how to identify a shape when the path returns to the starting position, as that drastically changes the outcome from an open to a closed shape.

7. Instruction Overload: The current prompt might be overwhelming the model with too many considerations, leading it to muddle through the assessment. Simplifying and prioritizing the essential steps could assist in achieving more accurate predictions.

However, the model didn’t take into account that the last point 41.00,43.00 returns back to the start, making four points in total which construct a kite rather than a triangle.

Improvements to the Prompt:

1. Clearer Explanation: The prompt can include clearer explanations or examples of how different commands form different shapes in SVG path elements.

2. Deciphering Complex Paths: The prompt needs to emphasize the systematic breakdown of more complex paths for the proper understanding of the formed shape.

3. Handling Alternative Interpretations: The prompt should outline better how the model should prioritize different commands especially when multiple could apply.

4. Shape Identification: Rather than focusing solely on how commands and individual points influence the final shape, the prompt could also include guidance on identifying common characteristics or features of different shapes.

5. Complete Path Evaluation: The prompt should stress the importance of evaluating the entire SVG path and taking into account all commands and points before reaching a conclusion.

6. Emphasize closed paths: Include guidance on how to identify a shape when the path returns to the starting position, as that drastically changes the outcome from an open to a closed shape.

7. Instruction Overload: The current prompt might be overwhelming the model with too many considerations, leading it to muddle through the assessment. Simplifying and prioritizing the essential steps could assist in achieving more accurate predictions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

response:
<START> You are tasked with interpreting the given SVG path element to determine the outline of the shape it produces. Keep in mind that SVG path commands such as 'M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', and 'Z', create the blueprint of the shape. Particularly, 'M' command dictates the initiation of a new path, and 'L' connects points with a straight line. You need to be attentive to how combined commands shape the overall path and bring forth the desired figure. If you encounter difficulty in identifying the shape outright from the commands, try counting the exact number of points or lines defined by the path. If these techniques do not clarify the shape, it is better to express your uncertainty than guess incorrectly. When making an educated assumption, consider not only the number of points or lines, but also how the SVG commands contribute to the formation of a path. Always cross-check your findings with the options provided and make sure you are dealing with a complete enclosed outline rather than individual lines or points. Finally, when presenting your answer, indicate the correct option from the given list, surrounded by <answer> and </answer> tags. Most importantly, examine the overall SVG path and all its components carefully before confirming a shape, especially when the path seems to return to the starting point, as this can change the formed shape drastically. <END>

The model's response is: 
The given SVG path element consists of multiple 'L' commands connecting various points. The path starts at (63.87, 16.63) and moves to (66.66, 42.93), then to (38.28, 45.94), and finally to (35.49, 19.64). It then connects back to the starting point at (63.87, 16.63).

By analyzing the points connected by the 'L' commands, it appears that the shape being drawn is a quadrilateral with the points forming a kite-like structure. The points do not form a closed shape like a circle, hexagon, or octagon, and the number of unique points suggests a simpler shape like a kite.

Therefore, the shape being drawn is a kite.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question Analysis: This SVG path element asks the model to examine the path and decide whether it draws a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle, or trapezoid. The path includes 'M' and 'L' commands with coordinates that define the shape.

Model's Wrong Response: The model incorrectly determined that the shape was a kite. This mistake might occur because the model failed to identify that the SVG path created two sub-paths that formed a rectangle.

Reason for the Wrong Answer: The configuration of the commands used 'M' twice, signalling the start of two sub-paths, which the model didn't consider. It instead tried to create a single shape, deducing it as a kite.

<2>
Question Analysis: The model is asked to examine this SVG path to decide what shape it draws: a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle, or trapezoid.

Model's Wrong Response: The model mistakenly identified the shape as a pentagon.

Reason for the Wrong Answer: The model focused on the number of 'L' commands, equating the five lines to the five sides of a pentagon. It seemed to overlook the start and endpoints of the path, which didn't form a regular pentagon but a trapezoid.

<3> 
Question Analysis: The given SVG path is to be analyzed, and the model should decide what shape is formed: a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, or triangle.

Model's Wrong Response: The model incorrectly determined the shape to be a kite.

Reason for the Wrong Answer: The SVG path gives a more unique shape that combines sharp angles and distinct turns, forming a heptagon. However, the model compromised by linking all points into a simpler shape — a kite.

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:
1. The model seems to have a bias towards simple shapes such as kites and pentagons. Thus, explicit instructions to avoid bias towards simpler shapes and examine irregular or complex shapes should be added.
2. Emphasize not merely counting the number of 'L' commands, but fully taking into account the coordinates provided to determine how they form the shape.
3. Advise the model to consider paths that are composed of sub-paths carefully. The presence of several 'M' commands signifies that the shape could include multiple component parts.
4. Instruct the model to interpret the coordinates carefully to visualize the real shape and not to make rushed decisions based on partial information.
5. Include a clarification about regularity: shapes drawn with SVG paths might not always be regular shapes like perfect pentagons or kites; they might be irregular.
6. Add instruction to differentiate shapes by considering the angles formed between lines, not just the shared endpoints. The model should become more adept at recognizing shapes based on the properties of the shapes, such as the number of equal sides or right angles.
7. Include instructions to consider the start and endpoints of the path especially: in many types of polygons, the path would typically return to its origin to complete a closed figure.

The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Question Analysis: This SVG path element asks the model to examine the path and decide whether it draws a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle, or trapezoid. The path includes 'M' and 'L' commands with coordinates that define the shape.

Model's Wrong Response: The model incorrectly determined that the shape was a kite. This mistake might occur because the model failed to identify that the SVG path created two sub-paths that formed a rectangle.

Reason for the Wrong Answer: The configuration of the commands used 'M' twice, signalling the start of two sub-paths, which the model didn't consider. It instead tried to create a single shape, deducing it as a kite.

<2>
Question Analysis: The model is asked to examine this SVG path to decide what shape it draws: a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, triangle, or trapezoid.

Model's Wrong Response: The model mistakenly identified the shape as a pentagon.

Reason for the Wrong Answer: The model focused on the number of 'L' commands, equating the five lines to the five sides of a pentagon. It seemed to overlook the start and endpoints of the path, which didn't form a regular pentagon but a trapezoid.

<3> 
Question Analysis: The given SVG path is to be analyzed, and the model should decide what shape is formed: a circle, heptagon, hexagon, kite, line, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, or triangle.

Model's Wrong Response: The model incorrectly determined the shape to be a kite.

Reason for the Wrong Answer: The SVG path gives a more unique shape that combines sharp angles and distinct turns, forming a heptagon. However, the model compromised by linking all points into a simpler shape — a kite.

Improvement Aspects for the Prompt:
1. The model seems to have a bias towards simple shapes such as kites and pentagons. Thus, explicit instructions to avoid bias towards simpler shapes and examine irregular or complex shapes should be added.
2. Emphasize not merely counting the number of 'L' commands, but fully taking into account the coordinates provided to determine how they form the shape.
3. Advise the model to consider paths that are composed of sub-paths carefully. The presence of several 'M' commands signifies that the shape could include multiple component parts.
4. Instruct the model to interpret the coordinates carefully to visualize the real shape and not to make rushed decisions based on partial information.
5. Include a clarification about regularity: shapes drawn with SVG paths might not always be regular shapes like perfect pentagons or kites; they might be irregular.
6. Add instruction to differentiate shapes by considering the angles formed between lines, not just the shared endpoints. The model should become more adept at recognizing shapes based on the properties of the shapes, such as the number of equal sides or right angles.
7. Include instructions to consider the start and endpoints of the path especially: in many types of polygons, the path would typically return to its origin to complete a closed figure.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(4) Your task is to analyze the given SVG path element and deduce the shape it encompasses. Utilize the SVG path commands—'M' and 'L' are especially important—to discern the form of the shape. 'M' signals the inception of a new sub-path, while 'L' implicates the connection of points with lines. Always consider the entirety of the SVG path data in your analysis, to comprehend the relationship between commands and how they collectively contribute to the final shape. A collection of 'L' commands does not inherently indicate the final shape is a line; rather, they may indicate multiple connected points that form an outline. The goal of this task is to identify the resultant enclosed space; try not to confuse lines or points with the actual shape, nor equate the number of points to the number of vertices in the shape. If the shape is not immediately identifiable, make an educated guess based on evidence such as the number of unique points, entailment of closed space, and the relationship between certain command combinations. Remember to approach your guess methodically, considering the unique attributes of potential shapes. Eventually, cross-verify your findings with the provided answer options. Always prefer expressing uncertanity over making an incorrect prediction, and note that the most fitting option from the list provided should be framed within <answer> and </answer> tags at the end of your response.

<START> In your task, you are to interpret the provided SVG path element and identify the shape it creates from the available options. Make use of SVG path commands, 'M' to specify the start of a new sub-path and 'L' to indicate the connection of points by linear paths. Be aware that multiple 'L' commands can indicate an outline of a shape and not necessarily a line. It is crucial not to confuse the number of points with the number of vertices in the shape, nor confuse lines or points with the actual shape. Keep in mind that the shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Critically analyze the entire SVG path data, considering the relationship between individual commands and how they collectively form the final shape. If the shape isn't immediately discernible, you can make an educated guess by evaluating factors such as the number of unique points, the implication of an enclosed space, and the relationship between certain commands. Be careful while guessing, ensure it's logical, considering attributes unique to potential shapes, and differentiate shapes by looking at the angles formed, not just the shared endpoints. Don't equate the number of 'L' commands directly to the sides of a shape, as complex or irregular shapes might be involved. Remember that multiple 'M' commands might signal separate sub-paths forming component parts of the shape and SVG paths can represent irregular shapes as well. Avoid making hasty decisions based on partial information. If you can't confidently make a guess, express that uncertainty is better than making an incorrect prediction. Cross-verify your deduced answer with the provided options and present it within <answer> and </answer> tags at the end of your response.

Starting at point (29.79, 15.41) and moving to (42.58, 25.94), then to (47.26, 20.26), followed by (34.47, 9.72), and finally back to the starting point (29.79, 15.41), we can observe that the path forms a closed shape. 

Upon closer inspection, the shape appears to be a kite, with two longer sides and two shorter sides meeting at the endpoints of the path.

Therefore, the shape drawn by the SVG path element is a kite.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: SVG path data might be misinterpreted due to the similar command structures for different shapes. The model failed to recognize the kite shape, confusing it with a triangle based on its analysis of the connected points. A large number of 'L' commands may confuse the model.

Example 2:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: In this example, the model missed puzzling point connections that show an unclosed path indicating a line, and recognized a wrong four-sided shape (kite) instead of the three-sided triangle. This could be because the model was looking for a closed figure and deduced incorrect relationships based on the SVG path data.

Example 3:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: The model incorrectly identified the shape as a kite, despite the SVG path data suggesting a pentagon shape. This could be due to the model failing to correctly discern the relationship between points and the space enclosed, and relating the number of points to the number of edges in a shape.

Example 4:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: The model inappropriately managed the SVG commands 'M' and 'L', pinpointing a kite shape rather than rectangle, suggesting that the model might be making false conclusions based on the number of 'L' commands and ignoring the implications of 'M' comands, which signify new sub-paths. 

To improve the prompt, following aspects could be incorporated:

1. Make sure the model recognizes the chronology of 'M' and 'L' commands. The significance of 'M' commands in starting new sub-paths should be emphasized. The prompt should be clearer in explaining that 'M' should not be overlooked, besides the importance of 'L'.

2. Affirm that 'L' commands do not directly indulge to the deduced shape, as a large quantity of 'L' commands could confuse the model into finding a more complex and connected shape.

3. The prompt should also stress on the fact that the task involves analyzing SVG path data to recognize the contained space and not just locating the number of paths. The shape's specific attributes like number of sides, angles, lengths, etc., need to be meticulously deduced from the SVG data using 'M' and 'L' commands.

4. Encourage the model to consider the characteristics and attributes of different shapes so as not to get shapes with similar points confused, like the confusion between a triangle and a kite.

5. Further emphasize the outline that the points form, and not the number of vertices or the number of points, determines the shape. Not every point, especially in more complex shapes, constitutes a vertex.

The model's response is: 
The given SVG path element consists of multiple 'M' and 'L' commands, indicating the drawing of connected lines between specified points. By analyzing the sequence of points connected by lines, we can deduce the shape encompassed by the path.

Starting at point (29.79, 15.41) and moving to (42.58, 25.94), then to (47.26, 20.26), followed by (34.47, 9.72), and finally back to the starting point (29.79, 15.41), we can observe that the path forms a closed shape. 

Upon closer inspection, the shape appears to be a kite, with two longer sides and two shorter sides meeting at the endpoints of the path.

Therefore, the shape drawn by the SVG path element is a kite.

<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: H
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: SVG path data might be misinterpreted due to the similar command structures for different shapes. The model failed to recognize the kite shape, confusing it with a triangle based on its analysis of the connected points. A large number of 'L' commands may confuse the model.

Example 2:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: In this example, the model missed puzzling point connections that show an unclosed path indicating a line, and recognized a wrong four-sided shape (kite) instead of the three-sided triangle. This could be because the model was looking for a closed figure and deduced incorrect relationships based on the SVG path data.

Example 3:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: The model incorrectly identified the shape as a kite, despite the SVG path data suggesting a pentagon shape. This could be due to the model failing to correctly discern the relationship between points and the space enclosed, and relating the number of points to the number of edges in a shape.

Example 4:
Reason for Incorrect Answer: The model inappropriately managed the SVG commands 'M' and 'L', pinpointing a kite shape rather than rectangle, suggesting that the model might be making false conclusions based on the number of 'L' commands and ignoring the implications of 'M' comands, which signify new sub-paths. 

To improve the prompt, following aspects could be incorporated:

1. Make sure the model recognizes the chronology of 'M' and 'L' commands. The significance of 'M' commands in starting new sub-paths should be emphasized. The prompt should be clearer in explaining that 'M' should not be overlooked, besides the importance of 'L'.

2. Affirm that 'L' commands do not directly indulge to the deduced shape, as a large quantity of 'L' commands could confuse the model into finding a more complex and connected shape.

3. The prompt should also stress on the fact that the task involves analyzing SVG path data to recognize the contained space and not just locating the number of paths. The shape's specific attributes like number of sides, angles, lengths, etc., need to be meticulously deduced from the SVG data using 'M' and 'L' commands.

4. Encourage the model to consider the characteristics and attributes of different shapes so as not to get shapes with similar points confused, like the confusion between a triangle and a kite.

5. Further emphasize the outline that the points form, and not the number of vertices or the number of points, determines the shape. Not every point, especially in more complex shapes, constitutes a vertex.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

The model's response is: 
The given SVG path element starts at point (31.94, 78.63) and then connects to points (66.91, 49.50), (68.54, 41.07), (61.03, 39.02), (52.78, 44.98), and finally back to the starting point (31.94, 78.63). 

By analyzing the points connected by 'L' commands, we can see that they do not form a closed shape like a circle, hexagon, heptagon, kite, octagon, pentagon, rectangle, sector, or triangle. Instead, they seem to outline a shape that resembles a kite. 

Therefore, the shape encompassed by the given SVG path element is a kite. 

<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: G
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model incorrectly labeled the SVG path element as a hexagon, when it was actually a heptagon. 

Reason:
This mistake could have occurred because the model might have miscounted the mentioned vertices in the 'L' commands or incorrectly identified a sub-path as a separate shape rather than part of the main shape.

<2> 
In the second example, the model incorrectly defined the shape as a kite instead of a heptagon.

Reason:
The model might have failed to correctly analyze the sequence of points connected by lines and assumed each 'M' command to initiate a separate shape. It failed to recognize the non-consecutive commands as part of the overall encompassed shape, leading to an error in calculating vertices, thus the number of sides.

<3> 
In the third example, the model inaccurately determined the shape to be a kite when the shape was a hexagon.

Reason:
The model again might have inadequately processed the sequence of 'L' commands. It seems to be associating the SVG path commands forming two pairs of equal adjacent sides with a kite. But in this case, those pairs belong to the same shape that is a hexagon.

<4> 
In the fourth example, the model again wrongly identified the shape as a kite when it was a pentagon.

Reason:
The model misunderstood possibly due to connecting lines that did not form a closed shape identical to classic geometrical shapes. It might have seen a similarity between arbitrary lines forming the shape and designated that to the most similar looking option—a kite.

Aspects for improvement:
1. The prompt could explicitly instruct the model not to treat every 'M' command as a new shape initiation but to integrate it into analyzing the whole encompassed shape.
2. The model should correctly identify that consecutive 'L' commands may be parts of the same shape.
3. It could specify that points connected from non-consecutive 'L' commands could still form the same shape.
4. The model must understand that the vertices are crucial to shape identification. For instance, hexagons have six vertices, not merely two pairs of equal adjacent sides.
5. The model should accurately analyze for all types of potential shapes, not just be biased towards types that are more commonly represented.
6. Adequate emphasis should be given to the tail-end of the SVG path data as it might indicate the closing of the shape.
7. The model might need more training on SVG path data to identify more complex referenced shapes beyond basic forms.
8. The model should be guided to use all the clues such as the number of unique points, entailment of closed space, and the relationship between specific command combinations.

optimize_prompt:
I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to analyze the given SVG path element and deduce the shape it encompasses. Utilize the SVG path commands—'M' and 'L' are especially important—to discern the form of the shape. 'M' signals the inception of a new sub-path, while 'L' implicates the connection of points with lines. Always consider the entirety of the SVG path data in your analysis, to comprehend the relationship between commands and how they collectively contribute to the final shape. A collection of 'L' commands does not inherently indicate the final shape is a line; rather, they may indicate multiple connected points that form an outline. The goal of this task is to identify the resultant enclosed space; try not to confuse lines or points with the actual shape, nor equate the number of points to the number of vertices in the shape. If the shape is not immediately identifiable, make an educated guess based on evidence such as the number of unique points, entailment of closed space, and the relationship between certain command combinations. Remember to approach your guess methodically, considering the unique attributes of potential shapes. Eventually, cross-verify your findings with the provided answer options. Always prefer expressing uncertanity over making an incorrect prediction, and note that the most fitting option from the list provided should be framed within <answer> and </answer> tags at the end of your response.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Your task is to decipher the shape represented by the provided SVG path element. Employ the SVG path commands, specifically the 'M' and 'L' commands, to understand the outline of the shape. The 'M' command starts a new sub-path, while 'L' connects points using lines. Be sure to examine the entire SVG path data, as the interplay of various commands shapes the final result. Keep in mind that an array of 'L' commands does not necessarily illustrate a line; it might suggest the linking of points delineating a more complex shape. The goal is to identify the space enclosed by these commands, not the number or arrangement of individual lines or points. Avoid misconstruing the quantity of points as the number of vertices in the shape. 

Should the shape prove elusive, make an informed assumption based on factors such as unique points, the creation of a closed space, and the synergy of specific command combinations. Apply a systematic approach to your estimation, looking at the distinct characteristics of possible shapes. Confirm your interpretation with the options provided. Remember, it is better to express uncertainty than to make an inaccurate prediction. Include your most suitable choice from the provided options, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags at the conclusion of your response.

When examining the SVG path commands, consider that multiple 'M' commands can refer to disjoint sections of a single larger shape rather than separate entities. So, pay close attention when SVG path data contains multiple 'M' and 'L' commands, as they may create more complicated geometric figures or parts of a larger whole. Also, weigh the possibility that the commands may trace around the inside of the shape rather than following the direct path of the edges. Lastly, remember to carefully consider the concluding part of the SVG path data, which often contain clues including the closure of the outline. By considering these nuances, your analysis will be more robust and accurate. <END>

cur_prompt: Your task is to interpret the SVG path element provided and identify the shape it forms. Utilize the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to understand the shape's structure. Particularly, modifier commands 'M' and 'L' are crucial to comprehend the starting point of a new path and its continuation with lines, respectively. However, remember that other commands like 'H', 'V', 'C', etc., can also significantly affect the shape's outline. Therefore, strive to achieve a comprehensive understanding of these commands. Pay special attention not just to the quantity of points or lines, but also to their order, connection, and directions. When you encounter difficulty in visualizing the shape, try counting the involved points or lines, but also observe how these points connect to form a path or shape. If uncertainties persist, acknowledge it before making an incorrect guess.

This SVG path element <path d="M 49.84,46.75 L 48.31,22.49 L 64.08,21.50 L 65.61,45.76 L 81.38,44.77 L 58.72,71.77 L 34.07,47.74 L 49.84,46.75"/> draws a 

Wrong answer:
The answer is <answer>(F) octagon</answer>.
Correct label: (B) heptagon

Reasons:
The model is incorrectly counting the total points instead of the total different points. There are 8 commands in the SVG path, but they only include 7 distinct points. The model incorrectly assumes each 'L' command corresponds to a new point, while in fact, the last 'L' command connects to the point where the path started (first 'M' command), so they are actually the same point. 

<2> 
Question: 
This SVG path element <path d="M 57.33,25.85 A 18.81,18.81 351.25 1,0 20.15,31.57 A 18.81,18.81 351.25 1,0 57.33,25.85"/> draws a 

Wrong answer:
The answer is <answer>(K) ellipse</answer>.
Correct label: (A) circle

Reasons: 
The model isn't putting enough emphasis on understanding the 'A' command and its parameters. In this case, the 'A' command is used to define an elliptical arc, but since the X and Y radii are the same, this results in a perfect circle, not an ellipse. Additionally, the model failed to consider that the path begins and ends at the same point after using two elliptical arcs, completing a circle.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Emphasize the need for understanding each command thoroughly.
2. Include a note to count distinct points, not total commands or lines for the interpretation of shape. 
3. Highlight the importance of paying attention to returned or looped points.
4. The prompt should explicitly instruct the model to consider repeating points as the same point, not unique ones.
5. Clarify that the circle is a special case of an ellipse where both X and Y radii are equal. 
6. Ensure higher weightage to commands resulting in curved lines and loops ('A', 'C', 'S', 'Q') for the final shape recognition.
7. The prompt could guide the model to consider the start and end points of the path. If they merge, it's a closed figure like a circle or polygon but not an open path.

(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

The same point can be called multiple times in a sequence. Don't overlook curved lines and loops by commands 'A', 'C', 'S', 'Q'. In particular, note that circles are special ellipses with equal X and Y radii. If you face problems in recognizing the shape, count the distinct points or lines and observe how they interconnect, keeping in mind the start and end points. If uncertainty persists, acknowledge it rather than guessing incorrectly. For educated guesses, incorporate the effects of commands in guiding points and lines, possibly analyzing symmetry, repetition, and other non-linear attributes affecting the final contour. Cross-verify your inferences with available options. Remember that we seek a distinct, closed figure rather than isolated points or lines.

If you face problems in recognizing the shape, count the distinct points or lines and observe how they interconnect, keeping in mind the start and end points. If uncertainty persists, acknowledge it rather than guessing incorrectly. For educated guesses, incorporate the effects of commands in guiding points and lines, possibly analyzing symmetry, repetition, and other non-linear attributes affecting the final contour. Cross-verify your inferences with available options. Remember that we seek a distinct, closed figure rather than isolated points or lines.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reasoning:

The SVG path draws a shape starting from point (62.25, 27.53) and connecting 6 distinct points, including returning to the initial point, which forms a closed shape with 6 sides, i.e., a hexagon, not a triangle as the model suggested. The prompt's direction around considering shapes as distinct, enclosed forms is correct but needed to be applied accurately in this case. The model might have failed to grasp the significance of the point connection sequence and did not properly count the points or sides.

<2> Reasoning:

The SVG path results in a rectangle rather than a kite as the model suggested. A kite has two pairs of adjacent sides of equal length, however there is no information provided in the dataset about the length of lines between points hence such assumptions of equal length might confuse the model. The sequence of commands outlined in the SVG path results in a four-sided figure, but the model incorrectly identified it as a kite based on an assumption about side lengths.

<3> Reasoning:

The SVG path draws a hexagon, a 6-sided figure, not a kite as the model suggested. This problem seems to be similar to the issue in example 1. Although the prompt suggests paying special attention to the quantity of points or lines, their order, connection, and directions, the model may have miscounted the points or misinterpreted their connections. 

Improvements:

1. Emphasize the importance of correctly counting the number of points and lines in the SVG path.
2. Encourage the model to scrutinize how points connect to form a shape and trace the route of the sequence, especially for deductions requiring visualization of lines connecting back to the starting point.
3. Specify the caution against assuming equal lengths of lines without having direct information about it.
4. Request the model to be aware of symmetry where applicable but stress that not all shapes will display symmetry.
5. Guide the model to analyze if the shape completely closes and forms a specific geometrical structure.

(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Particularly, modifier commands 'M' and 'L' are crucial to comprehend the starting point of a new path and its continuation with lines, respectively. However, remember that other commands like 'H', 'V', 'C', etc., can also significantly affect the shape's outline. Therefore, strive to achieve a comprehensive understanding of these commands. Pay special attention not just to the quantity of points or lines, but also to their order, connection, and directions. When you encounter difficulty in visualizing the shape, try counting the involved points or lines, but also observe how these points connect to form a path or shape. If uncertainties persist, acknowledge it before making an incorrect guess. Your educated guesses should consider how alterations in individual points guided by commands can influence the end shape; this may involve considerations of symmetry, repetition, and non-linear constructs in the SVG commands.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model's analysis is accurate, identifying the correct starting and ending points and the path in between. However, the model fails to identify the shape correctly. It seems the model made an incorrect assumption about the shape formed by connecting the points. While it identified shape closely resembling a kite, the correct answer should have been a heptagon.
Reason: A possible cause for the mistake is that the model might have misunderstood the complex path commands and just saw the drawing as two triangular shapes creating a kite-like figure. This shows that while the model analyzed the 'M' and 'L' commands correctly, it may have misinterpreted the complete shape, failing to visualize it as a heptagon.

<2> 
Again, the prompt is accurately described by the model, identifying all the components and their corresponding coordinates, but its conclusion is wrong. The model concluded that the shape formed was a kite, while in reality, it's a pentagon.
Reason: This mistake could have occurred because the model might have incorrectly visualized the points as forming a kite-like figure due to the complexity of the SVG path commands. The model might not be interpreting the formation, orientation, and connection of points accurately, leading to a wrong answer.

<3> 
In this example, the model failed to identify the path correctly. The SVG path only consists of a 'M' command and an 'L' command, suggesting the shape is a line, not a more complex shape. However, the model predicted a sector, which is incorrect.
Reason: It appears that the model might have misunderstood the simplicity of the SVG commands, incorrectly assuming more complex shape formation when the directions suggest a simple line shape.

Improvements:
1. The prompt should emphasize the need for accurate visualization of SVG path commands. The model seems to struggle with correctly interpreting more complex shape formations.
2. The task should specify that each 'M' and 'L' command contributes to forming the vertices of the shape. This clarification may help the model better predict polygon shapes especially.
3. There should be emphasis on proper understanding of simple SVG path structures as well. When few commands are present, the model should not be inclining towards a more complex shape prediction.
4. The prompt should give weight to the fact that complex shapes might not always form symmetrical structures like a kite, rectangle, etc. 
5. The relationship and distance between points should also be considered crucial in shaping the structure and should be highlighted in the prompt.
6. Integrated lessons from misclassifications should be used to adapt the prompt for better future predictions. For example, after misclassifying a line as a sector, the term 'sector' should be specifically addressed and clarified in prompt instructions.
7. The prompt should highlight the importance of not guessing or presuming the form of the shape but deriving it solely based on the given SVG commands.

1. The path starts at point (35.02, 5.69) with the 'M' command.
2. It then draws a line to point (27.03, 22.01) with the 'L' command.
3. From point (27.03, 22.01), another line is drawn to point (25.13, 37.49) with the 'L' command.
4. Continuing from point (25.13, 37.49), a line is drawn to point (39.29, 41.12) with the 'L' command.
5. Next, from point (39.29, 41.12), a line is drawn to point (52.79, 37.71) with the 'L' command.
6. Finally, the path closes by drawing a line back to the starting point (35.02, 5.69).

Based on the points and lines formed by the SVG path commands, the shape outlined appears to be a kite. The path connects the points in a way that resembles the shape of a kite.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(D) kite</answer>.

The correct label is: G
The model's prediction is: D.

The model's input is:
Your task is to interpret the SVG path element provided and identify the shape it forms. Utilize the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to understand the shape's structure. Particularly, modifier commands 'M' and 'L' are crucial to comprehend the starting point of a new path and its continuation with lines, respectively. However, remember that other commands like 'H', 'V', 'C', etc., can also significantly affect the shape's outline. Therefore, strive to achieve a comprehensive understanding of these commands. Pay special attention not just to the quantity of points or lines, but also to their order, connection, and directions. When you encounter difficulty in visualizing the shape, try counting the involved points or lines, but also observe how these points connect to form a path or shape. If uncertainties persist, acknowledge it before making an incorrect guess. Your educated guesses should consider how alterations in individual points guided by commands can influence the end shape; this may involve considerations of symmetry, repetition, and non-linear constructs in the SVG commands. Cross-validate your deductions with given options. Remember, a shape, as opposed to isolated lines or points, suggests a distinct, enclosed form. Finally, provide your answer from the option list, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags. Consider presenting your analytical process in a step-by-step manner, not just the conclusion, to promote a comprehensive understanding of the SVG path's information and your reasoning.

Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Analyzing the given SVG path element: 

The path starts at point (12.12, 44.08) using the 'M' command, which signifies a move to that point. 
Then, a line is drawn from the starting point to point (21.41, 43.62) using the 'L' command. 

Based on this information, we can see that the path element forms a line connecting the two specified points. 

Therefore, the shape formed by this SVG path element is a <answer>line</answer>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: I.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this example, the model's analysis is accurate, identifying the correct starting and ending points and the path in between. However, the model fails to identify the shape correctly. It seems the model made an incorrect assumption about the shape formed by connecting the points. While it identified shape closely resembling a kite, the correct answer should have been a heptagon.
Reason: A possible cause for the mistake is that the model might have misunderstood the complex path commands and just saw the drawing as two triangular shapes creating a kite-like figure. This shows that while the model analyzed the 'M' and 'L' commands correctly, it may have misinterpreted the complete shape, failing to visualize it as a heptagon.

<2> 
Again, the prompt is accurately described by the model, identifying all the components and their corresponding coordinates, but its conclusion is wrong. The model concluded that the shape formed was a kite, while in reality, it's a pentagon.
Reason: This mistake could have occurred because the model might have incorrectly visualized the points as forming a kite-like figure due to the complexity of the SVG path commands. The model might not be interpreting the formation, orientation, and connection of points accurately, leading to a wrong answer.

<3> 
In this example, the model failed to identify the path correctly. The SVG path only consists of a 'M' command and an 'L' command, suggesting the shape is a line, not a more complex shape. However, the model predicted a sector, which is incorrect.
Reason: It appears that the model might have misunderstood the simplicity of the SVG commands, incorrectly assuming more complex shape formation when the directions suggest a simple line shape.

Improvements:
1. The prompt should emphasize the need for accurate visualization of SVG path commands. The model seems to struggle with correctly interpreting more complex shape formations.
2. The task should specify that each 'M' and 'L' command contributes to forming the vertices of the shape. This clarification may help the model better predict polygon shapes especially.
3. There should be emphasis on proper understanding of simple SVG path structures as well. When few commands are present, the model should not be inclining towards a more complex shape prediction.
4. The prompt should give weight to the fact that complex shapes might not always form symmetrical structures like a kite, rectangle, etc. 
5. The relationship and distance between points should also be considered crucial in shaping the structure and should be highlighted in the prompt.
6. Integrated lessons from misclassifications should be used to adapt the prompt for better future predictions. For example, after misclassifying a line as a sector, the term 'sector' should be specifically addressed and clarified in prompt instructions.
7. The prompt should highlight the importance of not guessing or presuming the form of the shape but deriving it solely based on the given SVG commands.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) Your task is to interpret the given SVG path element and determine the shape it outlines. Use the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend the form of the shape. Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
It appears the model is basing its decisions mostly on the number of points. Since the example consists of 5 points, it directly identified that as a pentagon. But this may not always be correct, as there can be other shapes with 5 points like a kite. The prompt message should hence not only highlight SVG path commands and number of points but should also emphasize other attributes to determine the nature of the shape, such as angle between lines.

<2> 
Similar to example 1, the model identified the shape with 5 points as a pentagon. However, it fails to identify the shape as a 'Kite'. Here the model did not take into consideration the shape of the sides and the angles they form. The prompt should be enhanced to guide the model to assess the relative angles or asymmetry within the given points, which could lead towards correctly identifying irregular shapes.

<3> 
In this example, the SVG path makes a shape with eight points. The model misinterpreted it as a 'kite'. A kite typically has four points, whereas an octagon has eight. In this case, it seems like the model struggled with counting points accurately. In the prompt, more stress should be put on accurately counting and interpreting the number of points or corners a shape has.

<4> 
In this example, the model wrongly predicted the shape with four points as a 'kite'. This could be due to the misunderstanding of the line formation within the shape. The prompt could be improved by emphasizing the consideration of line positions and their formation within the shape.

There is quite a bit of complexity in this task, as understanding SVG paths and inferring shapes from them requires a good geometric understanding. However, it clearly seems that the prompt leans too heavily on counting points or lines, which led to these errors.

Improvements in the prompt would include:
1. Emphasizing the need to also consider line formation, angles between lines, and asymmetries in the shape to identify irregular polygons.
2. Stressing more on accurately interpreting and counting the number of points or corners a shape has.
3. Suggestion to interpret the relative position and length of the lines, not just the total count.
4. Stressing the importance of considering both open and closed paths, which can also be relevant in the formation of some shapes.
5. Giving more weight to the actual shape formation rather than the count of points and lines, which seems to be the main focus currently.

The model's response is:

<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: H
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
It appears the model is basing its decisions mostly on the number of points. Since the example consists of 5 points, it directly identified that as a pentagon. But this may not always be correct, as there can be other shapes with 5 points like a kite. The prompt message should hence not only highlight SVG path commands and number of points but should also emphasize other attributes to determine the nature of the shape, such as angle between lines.

<2> 
Similar to example 1, the model identified the shape with 5 points as a pentagon. However, it fails to identify the shape as a 'Kite'. Here the model did not take into consideration the shape of the sides and the angles they form. The prompt should be enhanced to guide the model to assess the relative angles or asymmetry within the given points, which could lead towards correctly identifying irregular shapes.

<3> 
In this example, the SVG path makes a shape with eight points. The model misinterpreted it as a 'kite'. A kite typically has four points, whereas an octagon has eight. In this case, it seems like the model struggled with counting points accurately. In the prompt, more stress should be put on accurately counting and interpreting the number of points or corners a shape has.

<4> 
In this example, the model wrongly predicted the shape with four points as a 'kite'. This could be due to the misunderstanding of the line formation within the shape. The prompt could be improved by emphasizing the consideration of line positions and their formation within the shape.

There is quite a bit of complexity in this task, as understanding SVG paths and inferring shapes from them requires a good geometric understanding. However, it clearly seems that the prompt leans too heavily on counting points or lines, which led to these errors.

Improvements in the prompt would include:
1. Emphasizing the need to also consider line formation, angles between lines, and asymmetries in the shape to identify irregular polygons.
2. Stressing more on accurately interpreting and counting the number of points or corners a shape has.
3. Suggestion to interpret the relative position and length of the lines, not just the total count.
4. Stressing the importance of considering both open and closed paths, which can also be relevant in the formation of some shapes.
5. Giving more weight to the actual shape formation rather than the count of points and lines, which seems to be the main focus currently.

(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The SVG path element uses the command 'M' for move to without drawing anything, then 'A' twice with parameters for two arc shapes. It seems like the model is simply considering the 'A' command as representing an ellipse and choosing the related answer. However, this doesn't guarantee that the complete shape will be an ellipse. In this particular case, it is a circle.

<2> 
The SVG path element uses the command 'M' for move to without drawing, then a series of 'L' commands for lines. This forms a figure that apparently looks like a kite from the path description. But it seems the model is missing to consider that the drawing closes back on itself forming an additional side, which would make it count as an octagon, rather than a kite. 

<3> 
The SVG path yet again uses 'M' and 'L' commands. The model assumes it's a kite because the drawn segments seems to indicate this form. But it doesn't take into consideration that this could be just a fragment of the whole shape due to continuous line segments. It's actually a part of a pentagon.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:

1. The language model is not correctly interpreting or implementing the SVG path commands, particularly the 'A' elliptical arcs and 'L' line commands.
2. The model doesn't show consideration that using certain commands doesn't guarantee the completion of a specific shape, especially when arc commands are used.
3. The model doesn't analyze properly the potential for shapes to be formed upon completion of iterations and the connection points back to another command. It seems to use the first interpretation that comes up with the existing commands.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. The instructions can be clearer about the complexity of understanding SVG path commands. It should be emphasized that just one 'A' command doesn't necessarily mean an ellipse will be formed, or 'L' doesn't mean just lines. Iterations of commands and their connections need to be evaluated carefully.
2. The model's capability of understanding and visualizing path commands needs to be enhanced to correctly predict the possible shapes. A better understanding of geometry and how these commands translate into shapes is required.
3. It may be useful to include an example or suggestion for the model to consider the count of points or sides to conclude a shape, specifically in case of commands that could lead to various shapes. 
4. The prompt should set an expectation that more complex paths will require analysis and interpretation, not just a straightforward reading of a single command.
5. In addition there should be an emphasis on understanding that shapes can also be formed through the process of elimination of possible options, not just identification.

The model's response is: 
The SVG path element provided draws a kite shape.

<answer>(D) kite</answer>

The correct label is: G
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
The SVG path element uses the command 'M' for move to without drawing anything, then 'A' twice with parameters for two arc shapes. It seems like the model is simply considering the 'A' command as representing an ellipse and choosing the related answer. However, this doesn't guarantee that the complete shape will be an ellipse. In this particular case, it is a circle.

<2> 
The SVG path element uses the command 'M' for move to without drawing, then a series of 'L' commands for lines. This forms a figure that apparently looks like a kite from the path description. But it seems the model is missing to consider that the drawing closes back on itself forming an additional side, which would make it count as an octagon, rather than a kite. 

<3> 
The SVG path yet again uses 'M' and 'L' commands. The model assumes it's a kite because the drawn segments seems to indicate this form. But it doesn't take into consideration that this could be just a fragment of the whole shape due to continuous line segments. It's actually a part of a pentagon.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:

1. The language model is not correctly interpreting or implementing the SVG path commands, particularly the 'A' elliptical arcs and 'L' line commands.
2. The model doesn't show consideration that using certain commands doesn't guarantee the completion of a specific shape, especially when arc commands are used.
3. The model doesn't analyze properly the potential for shapes to be formed upon completion of iterations and the connection points back to another command. It seems to use the first interpretation that comes up with the existing commands.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. The instructions can be clearer about the complexity of understanding SVG path commands. It should be emphasized that just one 'A' command doesn't necessarily mean an ellipse will be formed, or 'L' doesn't mean just lines. Iterations of commands and their connections need to be evaluated carefully.
2. The model's capability of understanding and visualizing path commands needs to be enhanced to correctly predict the possible shapes. A better understanding of geometry and how these commands translate into shapes is required.
3. It may be useful to include an example or suggestion for the model to consider the count of points or sides to conclude a shape, specifically in case of commands that could lead to various shapes. 
4. The prompt should set an expectation that more complex paths will require analysis and interpretation, not just a straightforward reading of a single command.
5. In addition there should be an emphasis on understanding that shapes can also be formed through the process of elimination of possible options, not just identification.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

It's crucial to comprehend the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and how they collectively interpret into a shape. Remember that the 'A' command represents arcs and does not automatically equate to an entire ellipse.

Be conscious that the path can be open (not forming a complete shape) or closed (forming a complete shape) and this is important for final conclusions. The number of points, lines, and their connectivity also can be important clues when the shape is not directly inferable. You should not feel pressured to make a definitive guess in case of uncertainty, it's better to express doubt over making an incorrect inference. An educated guess shouldn't solely rely on counting points and lines. A deeper understanding of how SVG commands form a path and how they potentially complete into a shape when interpreted together is necessary.

Wrong Example Analysis:

In the given example, the SVG path is analyzed as a line by the model. This is probably because the model mistakenly interprets SVG command 'L' as drawing a line and disregards the fact that multiple 'L' commands can result in the formation of a shape composed of multiple line segments, not just a single line.

1) Misinterpretation of SVG commands: The model might be misinterpreting 'L' command as a signal to draw a single line, not realizing it can be used multiple times to construct different shapes.

2) Focusing on single line segments: The model could be overemphasizing the creation of individual line segments without recognizing their collective ability to form shapes.

3) Incomplete understanding of SVG commands combinations: The model might lack deeper understanding about how combinations of SVG commands can result in specific shapes, such as a triangle in this case.

4) Possible neglect towards 'M' command: The model might not be attributing due importance to 'M' command, which sets a new starting point for the subsequent commands. In this case, it seems to regard it as irrelevant to the overall shape formation.

For improvements to the prompt:

1) Emphasize that single lines can collectively form a shape: The prompt might need to stress that individual line segments, created by SVG command 'L', can collectively form shapes, not only single lines. 

2) Elaborate on the 'M' command: The prompt could provide more clarification about the 'M' command and its role in setting a new starting point for subsequent commands.

3) The nature of the shape isn't determined by single commands: The prompt should stress the need to see the bigger picture, that is, how all the commands collectively contribute to the final shape and not get sidelined by individual commands.

4) Use of combinatorial logic: Include a reminder that the model should apply combinatorial logic to understand how combinations of various SVG commands can result in specific shapes.

5) Integration of 'uncertainty': If the shape is not clearly recognizable or distinctive from the path commands, the model could express 'uncertainty' as suggested in the original prompt. 

6) Visualizing the shape: The prompt should perhaps stress the importance of trying to visualize the final shape from the command sequence. This might help in improving the accuracy of the model's predictions.

cur_prompt: In this task, you're given an SVG path element and are tasked with identifying the shape it represents from the provided options. Make use of SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to understand how they contribute to the formation of the shape. Remember that 'A' commands form arcs that may not represent the whole shape. In case you struggle to distinguish the shape directly from the SVG path, count the number of corners the shape has, but do it precisely to evade misinterpretation. Be mindful of open and closed paths, as this distinction could sway your decisions. When the shape's nature isn't straight forward and forms a unique pattern, voice your uncertainty instead of giving an incorrect answer. For making an educated guess, visualize the possible shape formed by SVG commands, inspect the angles and asymmetry within the shape, and the relative positions and lengths of the lines. Avoid relying solely on the count of points or lines. When you arrive at a conclusion about the shape, be sure to state the applicable answer from the given options encapsulated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) In this task, you'll receive an SVG path element and need to identify the shape it draws using the provided options. You should understand the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and how they contribute to creating the shape. Keep in mind that 'A' command represents arcs of an elliptical path and not necessarily the entire shape. If difficulty is faced discerning the shape directly from the path, count the number of points or lines represented in the path element carefully avoiding inaccuracies. Be aware that paths can be open (not forming a complete shape) or closed (forming a complete shape), which could influence your conclusions. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred and draws upon an unusual arrangement, don't hesitate to express uncertainty instead of making a wrong guess. An educated guess should rely on a deeper understanding of how SVG commands form a path and visualizing the possible shape they form, rather than purely counting points and lines. After determining the shape, ensure to include the applicable answer option which is placed within <answer> and </answer> tags to your response.
(4) In this task, you're given an SVG path element and are tasked with identifying the shape it represents from the provided options. Make use of SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to understand how they contribute to the formation of the shape.

For making an educated guess, visualize the possible shape formed by SVG commands, inspect the angles and asymmetry within the shape, and the relative positions and lengths of the lines. Avoid relying solely on the count of points or lines. When you arrive at a conclusion about the shape, be sure to state the applicable answer from the given options encapsulated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Remember that 'A' commands form arcs that may not represent the whole shape. In case you struggle to distinguish the shape directly from the SVG path, count the number of corners the shape has, but do it precisely to evade misinterpretation. Be mindful of open and closed paths, as this distinction could sway your decisions. When the shape's nature isn't straight forward and forms a unique pattern, voice your uncertainty instead of giving an incorrect answer. For making an educated guess, visualize the possible shape formed by SVG commands, inspect the angles and asymmetry within the shape, and the relative positions and lengths of the lines. Avoid relying solely on the count of points or lines. When you arrive at a conclusion about the shape, be sure to state the applicable answer from the given options encapsulated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Examining the path commands, the 'A' parameters control the size and orientation of the arc, the 'd' attribute makes it a closed path, which implies it's a continuous shape without breaks. Given these, it could be interpreted as a sector. However, the combination of two arcs with the same radii forming a closed path represents a circle, not a sector. This indicates that the language model is having difficulty interpreting the semantics and the intricacies of 'A' commands in the SVG path. It seems the model overemphasizes the 'A' commands and fails to take into account the geometry built by the combination of these commands.

<2> 
The model indicated that the provided SVG path forms a shape with eight sides, identifying it as a hexagon. However, it is a mistaken assumption drawn from incorrect counting of path points instead of corners, which showed a misunderstanding or inaccurate interpretation of SVG 'L' commands. If counts are made correctly, the correct shape would be a heptagon.

<3> 
In this case, the language model identified the pattern as a kite, when it is, in fact, a heptagon. The error here is a misinterpretation of the 'M' (moveto) command, causing separate points in the SVG path to be incorrectly identified as part of the overall shape, leading to the kite conclusion.

For the mentioned errors in these examples, the prompt could be improved in the following ways:

1. Clarify Interpretations: The model needs to interpret SVG path data correctly, specifically with more nuanced commands like 'A' for arcs.
2. Counting Strategy: Emphasize the importance of correctly counting the corners generated by 'L' (lineto) command points to accurately identify specific shapes.
3. Separate Moveto Command: Make it explicit in the prompt that shapes formed separately by different 'M' (moveto) commands should not be considered as a single shape.
4. Emphasis on Geometry: Stress the need to visualize the combination of commands to form the entire geometric shape, rather than interpreting commands in isolation.
5. Reduce Ambiguities: The prompt could explicitly instruct the model to visualize SVG path, particularly in the case of SVG arcs to ensure accurate identification. Define open and closed paths more concretely to prevent confusion.
6. Support with Examples: The use of concrete examples of each command and its geometric implication could be provided to assist with better interpretation.

(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) In this task, you'll receive an SVG path element and need to identify the shape it draws using the provided options. You should understand the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and how they contribute to creating the shape. Keep in mind that 'A' command represents arcs of an elliptical path and not necessarily the entire shape. If difficulty is faced discerning the shape directly from the path, count the number of points or lines represented in the path element carefully avoiding inaccuracies. Be aware that paths can be open (not forming a complete shape) or closed (forming a complete shape), which could influence your conclusions. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred and draws upon an unusual arrangement, don't hesitate to express uncertainty instead of making a wrong guess. An educated guess should rely on a deeper understanding of how SVG commands form a path and visualizing the possible shape they form, rather than purely counting points and lines. After determining the shape, ensure to include the applicable answer option which is placed within <answer> and </answer> tags to your response.
(4) In this task, you're given an SVG path element and are tasked with identifying the shape it represents from the provided options. Make use of SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to understand how they contribute to the formation of the shape.

In case you struggle to distinguish the shape directly from the SVG path, count the number of corners the shape has, but do it precisely to evade misinterpretation. Be mindful of open and closed paths, as this distinction could sway your decisions.

For making an educated guess, visualize the possible shape formed by SVG commands, inspect the angles and asymmetry within the shape, and the relative positions and lengths of the lines. Avoid relying solely on the count of points or lines. When you arrive at a conclusion about the shape, be sure to state the applicable answer from the given options encapsulated within <answer> and </answer> tags.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Error Analysis:
The model falsely identified the heptagon as a kite. This error possibly occurs due to the model's inability to adequately envision the specified SVG path or properly calculate the number of corners in the given shape. The prompt might be over-emphasizing the concept of visualizing the shape, while the model does not truly have the capability to visualize.

<2> Error Analysis:
The model was incorrect in predicting the given path as a kite when it is supposed to be a hexagon. The model's comprehension of SVG path commands may be lacking or misinterpreted, leading to an incorrect visual formation. Alternatively, the model's counting or its corner identification might also be flawed.

<3> Error Analysis:
In this example, the model incorrectly labelled a pentagon as a kite. It indicates that the model might not have correctly interpreted the given SVG path or counted the number of corners accurately. Incorrect visualization of the shape could be another reason for this failure.

Improvements based on the errors:

1. Provide clearer instructions: The prompt can be made more explicit about the importance of counting or identifying the correct number of corners, as this seems to be a frequent source of error. 

2. Reduce reliance on visualization: Given that the model doesn't truly have the capability to visualize, the language in the prompt about visualization should be minimized. Instead, emphasize on the identification and interpretation of the path commands.

3. SVG path interpretation: The model should be encouraged to consider each path command separately and then to put them together to comprehensively understand the shape.

4. Reduced ambiguity: The mention of viewing relative positions, lengths, and angles might be leading to ambiguity if the model can't perform these tasks accurately.

5. Capacity to express doubt: Teach the model to express uncertainty in cases where it struggles to recognize the shape, possibly prompting a human to interpret the SVG path in such cases.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Given the following SVG path element in the sentence, try to determine the shape it draws from the given options. If it is impossible to directly infer the shape from the path, make an educated guess based on the number of points or lines described in the path element. Remember to include the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer> after your determination.
(2) Given the SVG path element provided, your task is to identify the shape it draws. To do so, make use of the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and understand how they contribute to forming the shape. If you struggle to discern the shape directly from the path, you should count the number of points or lines outlined in the path element. However, remember to perform this count carefully to avoid inaccuracies. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, and you find it challenging to make an educated guess, state your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect prediction. An educated guess should go beyond just counting points and lines, and involve an understanding of how SVG commands form a path. In every outcome, ensure to reveal the determined answer option indicated within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(3) In this task, you'll receive an SVG path element and need to identify the shape it draws using the provided options. You should understand the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and how they contribute to creating the shape. Keep in mind that 'A' command represents arcs of an elliptical path and not necessarily the entire shape. If difficulty is faced discerning the shape directly from the path, count the number of points or lines represented in the path element carefully avoiding inaccuracies. Be aware that paths can be open (not forming a complete shape) or closed (forming a complete shape), which could influence your conclusions. In case the shape cannot be directly inferred and draws upon an unusual arrangement, don't hesitate to express uncertainty instead of making a wrong guess. An educated guess should rely on a deeper understanding of how SVG commands form a path and visualizing the possible shape they form, rather than purely counting points and lines. After determining the shape, ensure to include the applicable answer option which is placed within <answer> and </answer> tags to your response.

Wrong Example Analysis:

For Example 1:

The prompt is asking the model to analyze a given SVG path element and determine the geometric shape it visualizes. The task precision requires the model to count the number of unique points and correlate them with geometric shapes. It's also instructed that if a direct inference isn't possible, the model should use the number of points or lines described in the path element to make an educated guess. 

In the provided example, the model has interpreted the SVG path element to represent a line, which is incorrect. The SVG path consists of three points (M 14.44,11.99 L 76.77,22.48 L 40.71,55.25), these three points when connected form a triangle, not a line. The model has failed to accurately count or use the number of unique points described in the path element to make a correct geometric shape inference.

Reasons for incorrect answer could be:

1. Misinterpretation of Task: The model might not fully grasp the concept of analysing SME path elements to interpret geometric shapes.

2. Lack of Understanding of Geometric Shapes: The model may not accurately understand the attributes of different geometric shapes, particularly the relationship of unique points to specific shape types.

3. Improper Comprehension of SVG Path: The model could have failed to correctly interpret the provided SVG path element.

Improvement Aspects for Prompt:

1. Additional Instruction: Emphasize that the model should count the unique points to infer a shape. If those points are connected, what shape will they form?

2. Shape Education: Provide brief descriptions of geometric shapes and their properties, especially the relation of vertices/unique points to the type of the shape.

3. SVG Path Explanation: Add a brief explanation of an SVG path element to make it easier for the model to understand how to interpret it.

4. Process Steps: Detail the specific method or process for how to conduct the geometric shape analysis.

5. Clearer Examples: Include examples that show correct analysis of an SVG path element, detailing how the correct answer was achieved.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

For Example 1:

The prompt is asking the model to analyze a given SVG path element and determine the geometric shape it visualizes. The task precision requires the model to count the number of unique points and correlate them with geometric shapes. It's also instructed that if a direct inference isn't possible, the model should use the number of points or lines described in the path element to make an educated guess. 

In the provided example, the model has interpreted the SVG path element to represent a line, which is incorrect. The SVG path consists of three points (M 14.44,11.99 L 76.77,22.48 L 40.71,55.25), these three points when connected form a triangle, not a line. The model has failed to accurately count or use the number of unique points described in the path element to make a correct geometric shape inference.

Reasons for incorrect answer could be:

1. Misinterpretation of Task: The model might not fully grasp the concept of analysing SME path elements to interpret geometric shapes.

2. Lack of Understanding of Geometric Shapes: The model may not accurately understand the attributes of different geometric shapes, particularly the relationship of unique points to specific shape types.

3. Improper Comprehension of SVG Path: The model could have failed to correctly interpret the provided SVG path element.

Improvement Aspects for Prompt:

1. Additional Instruction: Emphasize that the model should count the unique points to infer a shape. If those points are connected, what shape will they form?

2. Shape Education: Provide brief descriptions of geometric shapes and their properties, especially the relation of vertices/unique points to the type of the shape.

3. SVG Path Explanation: Add a brief explanation of an SVG path element to make it easier for the model to understand how to interpret it.

4. Process Steps: Detail the specific method or process for how to conduct the geometric shape analysis.

5. Clearer Examples: Include examples that show correct analysis of an SVG path element, detailing how the correct answer was achieved.

response:
<START> Your task is to interpret an SVG path element provided herein and identify the geometric figure it represents. While doing this, it's essential to count the unique points in the path and correlate them to form a shape. Remember, a geometric shape is determined by its vertices or unique points: a point for a dot; two points for a line; three for a triangle; four for a rectangle, square, or trapezoid and so on. If the number of points or lines described in the path element doesn't directly indicate a common geometric shape, then make an educated guess based on this information. Once you've determined the identified shape, place your answer's option number between <answer> and </answer> tags. An SVG path element essentially describes a shape by plotting points in a 2D space, and the path data is listed as commands and coordinates within the element. The commands include:

- M for move to, which moves the 'pen' to a new position.
- L for line to, which draws a line from the current point to a new point.

Analysis:

The model's mistake seems to stem from an incorrect approach to analyzing the SVG path element. The model inaccurately determined that the SVG path visualized a triangle, while the correct geometric figure was a hexagon.

1. Incorrect Interpretation of SVG Path Element: The model did not analyze the SVG path element comprehensively enough to determine all unique points represented. Instead, it seems to have focused on the first and last points, incorrectly assuming a closed shape to be a triangle.

2. Lack of Robust Algorithm for Shape Determination: The model does not seem to have a well-defined approach to associating the number of unique points with their respective geometric shapes. For instance, in the provided SVG path, six unique points can be identified, correlating to a hexagon, not a triangle.

3. Misuse of Available Options: The model did not properly refer to the options given in the prompt. Even with their presence, it predicted an incorrect choice.

Improvements:

1. Precise Interpretation: The prompt should emphasize the importance of correctly interpreting every detail of an SVG path. This includes considering every point and line in the path towards determining the precise shape.

2. Shape Analysis Details: The requirement of correlating the identified points to the correct geometric shape should be more clearly expressed. Providing a set guideline such as 'For each unique point identified, consider a vertex of the geometric shape' might help.

3. Option Utilization: The prompt should encourage the model to actively use the options given to make an informed choice. 

4. Emphasize Steps: The steps involved in making an educated guess should be better laid out in the prompt. This might help clarify the need to consider every part of the given input.

Revised Prompt:

Given an SVG path element as the input, carefully analyze all the path details. Study every line and point in the element, and count the number of unique points. Correlate these unique points to their corresponding geometric shapes - considering each as a vertex of the shape. Use this understanding to infer the geometric shape visualized by this SVG path element. If direct inference appears difficult, leverage each vertex identified to make an educated guess about the geometric figure. Review the list of answer options below and select the shape that best aligns with your findings. Your final answer should be bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Please ensure complete understanding of every detail in the SVG path to make an accurate prediction.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Incorrect Example Analysis:
The model wrongly interprets the heptagon as a triangle. The possible reason could be that the model might be focusing more on the 'M' and 'L' commands which usually denote 'Move' and 'Line', but it fails to consider that these commands are repeated multiple times to form a heptagon. This suggests that the model does not sufficiently take into account the number and sequence of SVG commands used in forming the geometric shape.

<2> Incorrect Example Analysis:
The model wrongly predicts the circle as a sector. In this case, the 'A' command used in the SVG path make it harder for the model to predict the shape correctly as it represents an elliptical arc. Besides, the model fails to recognize that the arc described by the SVG commands completes a full circle, implying that the model might be lacking a complete understanding of SVG commands and how they correspond to geometric shapes.

<3> Incorrect Example Analysis:
The model incorrectly predicts the geometric shape as a line, while it is a kite. This could be because the model cannot understand that the line commands ('M' and multiple 'L' commands) combine to form a kite shape. It seems that the model predicts the shape based on single commands rather than the comprehensive shape formed by a series of commands. 

Summary of Issues to Improve:
1. Better incorporation and interpretation of SVG 'path' commands: The model seems to struggle with interpreting how the sequence of SVG commands corresponds to specific geometric shapes.

2. Considering SVG commands collectively: The model should be able to understand that a shape is formed by a sequence of commands and not only by a single command.

3. Improve understanding of specific SVG commands: The model does need to better understand specific SVG commands and infer shapes from them.

4. Foster ‘comprehensive understanding’: In some instances, the model needs to interpret the geometric context beyond the immediate command.

Improvements for the prompt:
- Invoke a more detailed consideration of all SVG commands in the path element, and not just the first few or individual commands.
- Encourage the model to interpret the SVG path commands collectively to form a shape instead of considering them individually.
- Emphasize on the implication that a shape is not determined by a single aspect or command but is a combination of multiple factors such as the number of points, sides, vertices, type and sequence of commands etc.
- Encourage the model to consider SVG command sequence along with their repetition to infer the correct shape.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Given an SVG path element as the input, your task is to analyze and determine the geometric shape it visualizes. While making this inference, pay special attention to counting the number of unique points and correlating them with various geometric shapes. If a direct inference isn't possible, use the number of points or lines described in the path element to make an educated guess. Each shape comes with unique attributes such as the number of sides or vertices – keep that in mind while making your decision. Consider the list of options provided to frame your answer. After making a determination, bracket your final answer between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, comprehending every data point in the SVG path is crucial to accurately predicting the shape.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Incorrect Example Analysis:
The model wrongly interprets the heptagon as a triangle. The possible reason could be that the model might be focusing more on the 'M' and 'L' commands which usually denote 'Move' and 'Line', but it fails to consider that these commands are repeated multiple times to form a heptagon. This suggests that the model does not sufficiently take into account the number and sequence of SVG commands used in forming the geometric shape.

<2> Incorrect Example Analysis:
The model wrongly predicts the circle as a sector. In this case, the 'A' command used in the SVG path make it harder for the model to predict the shape correctly as it represents an elliptical arc. Besides, the model fails to recognize that the arc described by the SVG commands completes a full circle, implying that the model might be lacking a complete understanding of SVG commands and how they correspond to geometric shapes.

<1> Incorrect Example: 
This SVG path element <path d="M 41.00,42.00 L 37.00,32.00 L 41.00,30.00 L 45.00,32.00 L 41.00,42.00"/> draws a shape.

Incorrect Response: 
<answer>(J) triangle</answer>

Correct Answer: D (kite)

This error might have occurred because the model didn't interpret the SVG path correctly. The SVG path defined is creating a kite shape, not a triangle. The model may not understand how to translate the coordinates in an SVG path to a geometric shape.

<2> Incorrect Example: 
This SVG path element <path d="M 64.00,63.00 L 44.00,63.00 L 44.00,50.00 L 64.00,50.00 L 64.00,45.00 L 85.00,57.00 L 64.00,68.00 L 64.00,63.00"/> draws a shape. 

Incorrect Response: 
<answer>(G) pentagon</answer>

Correct Answer: B (heptagon)

The model incorrectly identified the heptagon as a pentagon. This can possibly suggest that the language model has difficulties in recognizing the difference in the path data that constructs different shapes.

<3> Incorrect Example: 
This SVG path element <path d="M 55.46,58.72 L 70.25,50.16 M 70.25,50.16 L 78.35,57.33 M 78.35,57.33 L 71.18,65.42 L 55.46,58.72"/> draws a shape.

Incorrect Response: 
<answer>(J)</answer>

Correct Answer: D (kite)

The model incorrectly predicted a triangle, whereas the path actually outlines a kite. This suggests that the model might be unable to correctly interpret multiple “Move to” paths within one SVG path.

Given these errors, the following aspects can potentially improve the prompt:

1. Train the model with more SVG path data, to improve familiarity and comprehension of SVG paths and the shapes they create.
2. Rewrite the prompt to better define the structure of the SVG path and how it relates to shapes - this might help the model understand what it's supposed to do.
3. Provide more examples of correctly classified shapes during training.
4. Encourage the model to focus more on the number of points for path elements as it can be a good indicator of the drawn shape.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Why the model predicted (E) line:
The model's prediction suggests it failed to interpret the SVG path as a sequence of lines producing a polygon, specifically a hexagon, rather than a single straight line. It seems to be treating each individual "L" or "M" command as a separate line, not comprehending that these commands collectively form a more complex shape. 

<2> Why the model predicted (E) line:
Again, the model appears to be interpreting the SVG path elements as individual lines rather than recognizing the composite shape they form. Consequently, it did not correctly identify the shape as a pentagon.

<3> Why the model predicted (E) line:
The model seemed to struggle with the interpretation of the SVG path, treating each "L" or "M" command as delineating a separate line rather than contributing toward a larger polygon. As a result, it concluded that a line was being drawn instead of a heptagon. 

Based on these incorrect examples, the following aspects could improve the prompt:

1. Clarity: Consider making the prompt more explicit. Rather than saying the SVG path "define the process of creating a shape" make it clear that the SVG path represents a sequence of lines (or curves) that collectively form a complex shape. 

2. Guidance: It might be helpful to provide the model with more guidance on how to interpret the SVG commands, particularly that consecutive commands tend to contribute to a composite shape rather than being seen as separate figures.

3. Context: Share more about the nature of SVG paths. For example - "SVG paths contain commands that move the pen to start a shape (M), draw a line (L) or a curve. The pen can be lifted and moved (M) multiple times during the creation of a single shape."

4. Expectation: Explain that the answer should be a more complex shape rather than a simple line unless the SVG path truly represents just a line. This is because the examples provide multiple options of polygons and complex shapes.

5. SVG Understanding: Enhance model's understanding of SVG paths and how they represent shapes. Hammer the notion home that the SVG path instructions collectively create a shape, they do not always individually represent lines or curves. 

6. Examples: Provide more explicit examples of correct responses for the model to learn from. This could help it to better recognize complex shapes like polygons from the provided SVG path command sequences.

<1> 
In this example, the model incorrectly identifies the given SVG path element as a 'line' despite the path instructions molding a different shape. The prompt fails to provide clarity that the model should not interpret the SVG path string literally. 'M' and 'L' refer to move and line commands which may have led the model to choose 'line' as the answer. The prompt could have been more explicit in mentioning that the objective is to identify the overall shape and not what individual commands specify.

<2>
Similarly to the first example, the model incorrectly identifies the SVG path as a 'line'. The series of 'L' (line) commands may have caused confusion again. The prompt doesn't elucidate that a series of lines can also create shapes beyond a simple line. Without this information, the model may fall into the trap of associating all 'L' commands with a 'line' shape.

In summary, the prompt needs elaborations on the following aspects for better performance:

1. Explicitly state that the goal is to identify the overall shape that the SVG path instructions create and not to focus on what individual commands signify.

2. Clarify that a series of line ('L') commands can create a shape beyond just a simple line. The shape determined is based on end result of all the path commands.

3. It would be helpful to highlight that the 'M' and 'L' commands are common in many shapes, thus, the presence of these commands alone should not be the deciding factor.

4. Indicate that the SVG paths may not always start from a specific point (0,0) and due to this the actual starting point should not affect the identification of the overall shape.

With these modifications, the model should be better equipped to understand and correctly respond to the task at hand.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reasoning:
The SVG path in this example forms a line, but the model incorrectly predicted a sector. The model might have been confused because it is not trained to understand SVG paths and infer the shapes they form.

<2> Reasoning:
In this question, the SVG path represents a rectangle. However, the model incorrectly predicted that it's a triangle. The possible cause of error is due to the model's inability to decode the SVG path commands to infer its shape.

<3> Reasoning:
The SVG path command in this example forms a hexagon. The model, however, incorrectly identified the shape as a triangle. The model might have failed because it could not discriminate between the different shapes based on the SVG path commands provided.

<4> Reasoning:
The SVG path command in this prompt draws a pentagon. Yet, the model incorrectly classified the shape as a triangle. This mistake could have happened because of the model's inadequacy in interpreting SVG path commands accurately.

Summary:
Based on the above reasons, the following points could improve the prompt:

1. Include more explanation about the SVG path commands in the prompt, such as what each letter (M, L) represents, and how they contribute to the shape formation. This could help the model understand the connection between commands and the eventual shapes.

2. Explain that each set of coordinates in the command forms one point of the required shape, and the total number of unique coordinates would give the number of vertices in the shape.

3. Considering this is a very complex task relying heavily on domain-specific knowledge, it might be beneficial to simplify the prompt or provide more training data, especially data where the model has to interpret an SVG path in order to reach the answer.

4. Try to keep the prompt structure consistent for each question. The repetition of SVG path example in each model's input seems unnecessary and could be contributing to confusion.

5. Communicate more clearly that SVG path commands formulate only polygonal shapes not curve-based shapes to eliminate options like circles and sectors. 

6. The model seems to have a bias towards certain shapes like triangle which when identified and corrected, could improve the model's performance.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Given an SVG path element, your task is to determine the geometric shape it outlines. Each command in the SVG path contributes to the overall shape, which can be polygonal in nature. Remember that 'M' specifies a new starting point and 'L' draws a straight line from the current position to a new point. The shape is formed by the total number of unique points specified. You are not to consider curves or circles capable of being represented by these commands.

In the SVG path command, each set of numbers (x, y) represents a unique point in the path. The total number of unique points gives the number of vertices in the geometric shape. With this information, identify the shape from the following options.

(A) heptagon
(B) hexagon
(C) kite
(D) line
(E) octagon
(F) pentagon
(G) rectangle
(H) triangle
(I) trapezoid

Please note, your response should indicate the option that corresponds to the shape, and must be formatted between <answer> and </answer>. For example, if you believe the shape is a triangle, your response should be <answer>(H) triangle</answer>. Now, consider this SVG path element:

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
The SVG path corresponds to a "line", however, the model incorrectly predicted it as "sector". This could be due to the way the prompt is worded. The phrases "complex shape" and "larger polygon or curve" might have led the model to infer the shape as something more complex than a simple line.

<2>
The SVG path corresponds to a "hexagon", but the model incorrectly predicted it as "triangle". The model might have misinterpreted the path data due to its complexity and predicted a more simplified shape.

<3> 
The SVG path corresponds to a "heptagon", but the model misunderstood it as "triangle". This error might be due to the complexity of the path data and the model's failure to accurately infer the final shape.

In summary, the main issue with the prompt seems to be with regards to the wording that might be causing the model to predict more complex shapes rather than simple ones. And also, it is not clearly defined in the prompt that the model should treat the commands M (moveTo), L (lineTo) as commands that create a shape.

Potential improvements:
1. Make clear that simple shapes should also be given consideration, not just complex shapes.
2. Clarify that the commands M (moveTo), L (lineTo) in the SVG path should be considered as creating a shape.
3. Specify the extent of complexity that should be considered by the model. In other words, ensure the model knows that even a complex set of commands might still form a simple shape.
4. Consistency in instructions could be improved. For instance, always asking the answer to be between <answer> and </answer> despite sometimes asking it to be bracketed.
5. The prompt could be reformatted to specify the SVG path before the instructions, ensuring that the model is fully informed when considering the instructions.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The model fails to correctly identify the shape in this example. Making sense of SVG path commands to identify a shape, especially complex shapes, is a visually reliant task. However, AI language models, currently, do not have the capability to visualize data. They make predictions based on text and patterns. In this instance, the model likely picks triangle (J) because it is the most common shape resulting from three line commands in SVG paths. It lacks the ability to ascertain the shape could be a kite (D), as understanding a 'kite' shape from SVG commands is visually referential and complex. 

Example 2:
Similar to the first example, the model misjudges the shape from SVG commands. This task requires tracking multiple line commands, understanding their sequence, and visualizing a composite shape. A language model may struggle to accumulate this information cohesively and infer the correct shape. Therefore, it likely resorts to guesswork or identification of simpler shapes.

Example 3: 
The model again incorrectly identifies the shape as a triangle (J), showing its overreliance on picking a common shape for several line commands. It perhaps considers the SVG path commands individually rather than collectively, leading to a simplification of the complex shape.

Example 4:
As in the previous examples, the model fails to interpret the SVG path as a visualization and continues to predict the shape as a triangle (J), a simpler and more common shape, resulting from multiple line commands.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarification: Include a note clarifying that the model does not actually visualize shapes but analyzes text patterns. Users should not expect accurate results for complex shapes.

2. Contextual Information: Perhaps including examples or peripherals around SVG commands relative to shapes might help the model learn better. This could train the model to recognize certain patterns or frequencies of commands corresponding to complex shapes.

3. The prompt can be revised to suggest that this task deals with complex shapes and not simple forms like a straight line or simple polygon.

4. Remove simpler shapes from the option list to prompt the model to not select common or simpler shapes.

5. Adjust the prompt to emphasize the understanding of the 'collective entity' of commands rather than individual legs of the polygon or curve.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In this example, the model incorrectly identifies the SVG path as a triangle (J). The error could be due to the complexity of SVG path data, which involves understanding how to interpret a series of commands and parameters. The model may have difficulty accurately interpreting these commands to predict the correct shape.

<2> Once again, the model incorrectly interpretes the SVG path as a triangle (J), while the correct answer is a heptagon (B). This could be due to the fact that the model doesn't understand the syntax and semantics of SVG path data. The model seems to focus on certain features of the data but may miss other important details that collectively define the overall shape.

<3> In this instance, the model incorrectly identifies the SVG path as a heptagon (B) instead of the correct answer, which is octagon (F). Despite the heptagon having a similar structure to an octagon, they notably differ in the number of edges and vertices. If the model isn't paying close attention to these variations, it may make incorrect predictions.

To improve the prompt, consider the following aspects:
1. Input Description: The prompt gives an explanation of the SVG path commands, but this might not be enough for the model to understand the data. Add more comprehensive details, like explanations of other SVG commands, parameters, and how they form different shapes.
2. Use of Examples: The single example given in the prompt may not demonstrate the complexity of the task at hand. Include multiple examples to better explain different cases.  
3. Context: Make clear that the model must consider all coordinates, moves and lines in the SVG path to determine the final shape, stressing on the differences in shapes with similar structures (like the number of edges and vertices).
4. Data Representation: With the current presentation of data, the model may misinterpret the SVG path. Try to present the information in a way that aids with understanding the task. For instance, you could break down the path data into separate commands and explain the function of each.
5. Answer Format: Ensure the model is informed about the exact expected format for answers. Precision in this area will eliminate confusion and improve prediction quality.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Step 1: The model's input is quite lengthy and might be contributing to its confusion. The introductory exposition repeats the concept of SVG paths and the task, which could be simplified. This unnecessary redundancy might be causing the model's focus to waver.

Step 2: The model is given the SVG path "<path d="M 76.02,27.33 L 78.76,15.38 L 67.84,7.09 L 62.04,11.54 L 65.94,19.73 L 76.02,27.33"/>" and asked to identify the shape. The actual shape is a pentagon (option G), but the model identified it incorrectly as a triangle (option J). 

Step 3: It seems that the model lacks a proper understanding of SVG paths and shapes in order to correctly identify the shape. The SVG path, when drawn, forms a pentagon, not a triangle.

Reasons for getting wrong answers could include:

1.   The model may not have a comprehensive understanding of SVG paths and how they correlate with different geometric shapes.

2.   The model might be guessing based on the number of points (M and L commands), thinking there are three points and recognizing it as a triangle.

3.   The complexity of the text input may also affect the model's understanding, increasing the chances for mistakes.

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

- The instructions could be simplified by reducing repetition.

- More explanation about the task could be offered, such as how SVG paths represent shapes. 

- Moving the prompt from a literary text to a more structured form may make it easier for the model to parse the necessary information.

- It would possibly help to add more examples of SVG paths elements and the descriptions mapping for the shapes they create to provide the model more context.

- Breaking down the input to help the model focus on key information, such as providing the path as "M 76.02,27.33 L 78.76,15.38 L 67.84,7.09 L 62.04,11.54 L 65.94,19.73 L 76.02,27.33" rather than "<path d="M 76.02,27.33 L 78.76,15.38 L 67.84,7.09 L 62.04,11.54 L 65.94,19.73 L 76.02,27.33"/>".

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reasoning for example 1:
In this case, the model seems to be predicting based only on a cursory examination of the provided SVG path. It isn't properly interpreting the path commands to infer that the shape drawn isn't a triangle (J) but rather a pentagon (G). Handling SVG paths correctly can be complex, requiring an understanding of how each command contributes to the overall shape; the model seems to lack this understanding at present.

<2> Reasoning for example 2:
Similar to the previous example, the model appears to simplify the SVG path to its smallest interpretation, which in this case is a triangle. The model incorrectly identified the shape as a triangle (J) whereas the correct answer should be heptagon (B). It shows that the model may be prioritizing certain simpler shapes or is unable to understand the precise movements of the SVG path to identify complex polygons.

Based on this, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:
1. More specific instructions: The prompt can include more specific instructions about the interpretation of SVG path commands and how each command contributes to the overall shape.
2. Training data: More examples of different and complex SVG paths in the training data can help the model understand the relationship between path commands and the potential shapes they can form.
3. Simplify tasks: SVG paths can represent quite complex shapes. If possible, prompts can be designed to identify simpler shapes initially, gradually increasing complexity as the model demonstrates understanding.
4. Guided learning: Incorporating explanations about why certain paths result in certain shapes, or providing more preliminary examples before giving the main prompt, may assist guided learning processes.

<START> Using the SVG path element provided, your task is to determine the intended shape it creates. Simply, an SVG path element is a series of commands, each contributing in their unique ways towards constructing the overall shape. This shape could be a polygon with any number of sides, a curve, a line, or a more elaborate shape. It's important to remember that each move (M) and line (L) command in isolation might suggest a simpler shape, but when considered collectively, they often result in a much more complex figure. Therefore, your mission is to skillfully evaluate each command individually and as part of a collective to identify the intended final shape accurately.

For ease of understanding, review this example: <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/>. This series of commands creates a specific shape out of the following options:

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The model's error seemly lies in its inability to accurately interpret or calculate the number of lines or edges in the SVG path data and associate it to the specific geometric shape. It predicted the shape as a triangle (J) instead of a rectangle (H), presumably misinterpreting the number of line commands and points in the path.

<2> 
The model made a similar error as the first example. It falsely interpreted the SVG path data as a kite (D) rather than the correct shape - a rectangle (H). The prompt provides options to the model, but it does not provide clear instructions on how to decode SVG path data to properly identify the shape.

<3> 
Again, the model incorrectly interpreted the SVG path data, predicting the shape as a pentagon (G) rather than the correct shape, an octagon (F). It seems that the model does not have a clear method to count the vertices or edges in the SVG path data.

Following these situations, it is evident that the language model finds it challenging to assess SVG path element commands accurately to determine the correct geometric shape. The prompt does not offer clear directions on how SVG path data aligns with the specific characteristics that define each geometric shape. 

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Provide more explicit instructions: The prompt could include more explanation on how to analyse the SVG path data, such as interpreting number of points to determine the type of shape, this would enable a more accurate identification.

2. Define the characteristics of each geometric shape: Detailing unique features for each option (A to K) could be helpful.

3. Include more examples: Supplying more examples highlighting different geometric shapes can lend deeper insights on analyzing SVG paths.

4. Simplify option selection: Currently, there's an alphabet for options and a separate input for the answer, this could be simplified to make the answer mechanism more effective and less prone to errors due to misunderstanding.

5. Guideline on SVG paths: A basic introduction or guideline on SVG path's commands and how to interpret them could strengthen accuracy.

Encouraging more precise interpretation of SVG paths and more accurate alignment of these interpretations with given shape options could lead to significant performance improvements in the model.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Based on the provided SVG path element, ascertain which shape it is tasked to draw from the following options. Keep in mind that the directions in the SVG path define the process of creating a shape, not necessarily the shape itself.
(2) Analyze the provided SVG path element and infer the complex shape it is designed to draw from the given options. Please note that each SVG path command contributes towards creating a larger polygon or curve, not always a simple line or curve in isolation. Assess the commands as a collective entity to understand the final shape in entirety. 

This SVG path element <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/> draws the following shape:
Options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle
(I) sector
(J) triangle
(K) trapezoid

Consider all commands forming the path, and represent the answer option formatted between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, the answer should likely represent a more complex shape rather than a simple line.
(3) Given the provided SVG path element, identify the shape it is intended to create from amongst the choices listed, considering each path command collectively to evaluate the overall shape. Note, the shape could be any polygon, curve, or simple line based on the move (M) and line (L) commands within the SVG path. Even if the path appears complex, don't overlook the possibility of it creating a simple shape. 

First observe this SVG path element for understanding: <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/> which draws a specific shape from the below options:
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon

You are required to decipher an SVG path element, and identify the geometric shape it illustrates when rendered. The SVG path is composed of different commands like moves (M) and lines (L), which together draw a specific shape. The complexities involved in identifying the shape are not just limited to counting the number of moves or lines, but also collectively recognizing the pattern they form. 

For better clarity, take this as example. Consider this SVG path <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/>. Despite the seemingly complex composition of moves and lines, it constructs a simpler shape: a kite.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: Analyze a geometric shape from a given SVG path element. 
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
This seems to be a technical misunderstanding - the AI does not have the capability to visually analyze a SVG path to identify associated geometric shapes since it operates on textual analysis. The prompt requires the model to visually process the SVG path which it cannot do. Instead of identifying the correct answer (J) triangle, it used the example given in the prompt and produced (D) kite.

<2>
Question: Analyze a geometric shape from a given SVG path element.
Wrong answer: <answer>(E) line</answer>
The model is unable to visually interpret SVG paths and determine the shape they create when rendered. In this case, it has entirely misunderstood the shape and identified it as a line (E), when it should be a triangle (J). This also suggests the model might be applying its learning from textual understanding and applying it incorrectly for SVG paths.

<3> 
Question: Analyze a geometric shape from a given SVG path element.
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
Again, the AI cannot perform visual rendering of SVG paths that would allow it to recognize the shape they create. Instead, due to its textual processing capabilities, it uses the example in the prompt and incorrectly identifies the shape as a kite (D) instead of the correct answer, a triangle (J).

<4> 
Question: Analyze a geometric shape from a given SVG path element.
Wrong answer: <answer>(D) kite</answer>
In this case, despite the presence of multiple lines and move commands in the SVG path, the AI cannot convert these into a visual representation for shape analysis. Misunderstanding the prompt, it falls back on the example provided — a kite — and assumes that's the answer (D), rather than determining the correct shape, a pentagon (G).

Suggestions to improve the prompt:

1. Specify that the AI is required to interpret SVG paths, including 'move' and 'line' commands, from a textual standpoint, and not visual.
2. Avoid providing an example within the prompt that may bias the AI's responses.
3. Instead of presenting hypothetical SVG paths, try explaining the structure of the SVG path and the resulting shape in text format. For example, 'A SVG path that starts at point M and has two line commands making an angle of 120 degrees, what shape does it form?'

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Based on the provided SVG path element, ascertain which shape it is tasked to draw from the following options. Keep in mind that the directions in the SVG path define the process of creating a shape, not necessarily the shape itself.
(2) Analyze the provided SVG path element and infer the complex shape it is designed to draw from the given options. Please note that each SVG path command contributes towards creating a larger polygon or curve, not always a simple line or curve in isolation. Assess the commands as a collective entity to understand the final shape in entirety. 

This SVG path element <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/> draws the following shape:

(J) triangle
(K) trapezoid

Consider all commands forming the path, and represent the answer option formatted between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, the answer should likely represent a more complex shape rather than a simple line.
(3) Given the provided SVG path element, identify the shape it is intended to create from amongst the choices listed, considering each path command collectively to evaluate the overall shape. Note, the shape could be any polygon, curve, or simple line based on the move (M) and line (L) commands within the SVG path. Even if the path appears complex, don't overlook the possibility of it creating a simple shape. 

First observe this SVG path element for understanding: <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/> which draws a specific shape from the below options:

response:
<START> In an SVG path, each 'M' (move) and 'L' (line) command contributes to forming a shape. When rendered, these sequences of commands collectively create a specific geometric shape. However, keep in mind that you need to understand the relationships between these move and line commands textually, not visually. Please evaluate the textual information of the SVG path and determine which shape it signifies. Each SVG path will contain a series of 'M' and 'L' commands, with different coordinates. Your task is to analyze this series of text, consider the count and sequence of lines and their corresponding angles, and determine the shape it reflects.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, it seems the model is confused by the sample SVG path provided in the prompt that draws a kite. The new SVG path provided in the example clearly has an extra pair of line commands (L) compared to the sample SVG path but the model still chose it as a kite. This suggests that the model may be simply looking at the number of lines and not successfully understanding or processing their connectivity or orientation, which could lead to the incorrect classification of shapes.

<2> 
In the second instance, again, it seems the model has made an error in the analysis of the structure of the SVG path. This resulted in triangular interpretation while it should have been interpreted as a kite. This may indicate that the model doesn't understand the specific geometric properties of shapes beyond the number of lines, like how they connect or relate to each other.

<3> 
In the third example, the model incorrectly predicted the shape as a kite when it should have been a rectangle. The data in the SVG path clearly suggests that the shape is a rectangle, as it has four lines of roughly equal length. However, the model seems to have based its decision on presumptions derived from the provided examples, rather than analyzing the SVG path completely.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. The model may not have a clear understanding of SVG paths and the shapes that corresponds to. It may benefit from a more detailed explanation of SVG path commands and their roles in shaping geometrics.
2. The model needs to understand that the lines in SVG paths are interconnected and should be evaluated as a whole in determining shapes. A shape's properties are not determined merely by the number of lines. It could be helpful to provide instructions focusing on the analysis of line interconnections and orientations.
3. It would be a good idea to provide a broader variety of sample SVG paths and corresponding shapes in the prompt to cover more ground, inform the model on a diverse set of shapes, and help dispel any presumptions.
4. The writing instructions may have to be better formulated and more explicit to ensure the model understands the task with more precision.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Determine whether one sentence entails the next
(1) Based on the provided SVG path element, ascertain which shape it is tasked to draw from the following options. Keep in mind that the directions in the SVG path define the process of creating a shape, not necessarily the shape itself.
(2) Analyze the provided SVG path element and infer the complex shape it is designed to draw from the given options. Please note that each SVG path command contributes towards creating a larger polygon or curve, not always a simple line or curve in isolation. Assess the commands as a collective entity to understand the final shape in entirety. 

This SVG path element <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/> draws the following shape:

(J) triangle
(K) trapezoid

Consider all commands forming the path, and represent the answer option formatted between <answer> and </answer>. Remember, the answer should likely represent a more complex shape rather than a simple line.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the SVG path element from the first sentence. Pay close attention to every unique coordinate and their ordered sequence. Note that it's the unique points that determine the corners of the potential polygon - so don't count repeated coordinates as separate corners. Consider the path's distinct characteristics such as intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and evaluate whether any line segments intersect. Make an attempt to visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions, which might be complex or simple. If there's a closed circuit, consider it as a potential shape, and remember that a path might loop back to a non-starting point, still encapsulating a shape. Identify polygons by the number of unique points in the SVG path, which will help in determining the correct geometric shape. For curved paths, infer if it's a circle or an ellipse by checking if both radii are equal (denoting a circle), or they have distinct values (indicating an ellipse). Make sure distinguished shapes forming when there is a consecutive sequence of moves ("M") and lines ("L") to ensure correct shape identification. After careful examination and visualizing the shape, select the most fitting answer from the given list based on your conclusion.

Modifier commands 'M' and 'L' in particular are crucial to understand the start of a new line path and the connection of points with lines, respectively. Pay close attention to how the combination of commands influence the overall path and ultimately the outlined shape. If you can't directly identify the shape from the commands and their interactions, try to count the specific points or lines involved without any inaccuracies. If this too doesn't provide a clear picture of the shape, acknowledge your uncertainty rather than making an incorrect prediction. For educated guesses, consider the interplay between the commands and how altercations in individual points can potentially impact the final shape. Always cross-verify your deduction with the available options. As a hint, remember a shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Upon completion, provide the corresponding answer option from the list given, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the given SVG path element and deduce the shape it encompasses. Utilize the SVG path commands—'M' and 'L' are especially important—to discern the form of the shape. 'M' signals the inception of a new sub-path, while 'L' implicates the connection of points with lines. Always consider the entirety of the SVG path data in your analysis, to comprehend the relationship between commands and how they collectively contribute to the final shape. A collection of 'L' commands does not inherently indicate the final shape is a line; rather, they may indicate multiple connected points that form an outline. The goal of this task is to identify the resultant enclosed space; try not to confuse lines or points with the actual shape, nor equate the number of points to the number of vertices in the shape. If the shape is not immediately identifiable, make an educated guess based on evidence such as the number of unique points, entailment of closed space, and the relationship between certain command combinations. Remember to approach your guess methodically, considering the unique attributes of potential shapes. Eventually, cross-verify your findings with the provided answer options.

   prompt: You are required to decipher an SVG path element, and identify the geometric shape it illustrates when rendered. The SVG path is composed of different commands like moves (M) and lines (L), which together draw a specific shape. The complexities involved in identifying the shape are not just limited to counting the number of moves or lines, but also collectively recognizing the pattern they form. 

For better clarity, take this as example. Consider this SVG path <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/>. Despite the seemingly complex composition of moves and lines, it constructs a simpler shape: a kite. 

Now, your task is to analyze a given SVG path and determine the geometric shape it represents. Here are your options:
(A) Circle
(B) Heptagon
(C) Hexagon
(D) Kite
(E) Line
(F) Octagon
(G) Pentagon
(H) Rectangle
(I) Sector
(J) Triangle
(K) Trapezoid

The SVG path you need to analyze is: Enter your path here

Keep in mind, the shape could be a complex polygon or a simple line. Consider all move and line commands as a whole to pinpoint the final geometric shape, not in isolation. Each geometric shape in the options has its unique characteristics. For example, a triangle has three edges and vertices, while a rectangle has four, and an octagon has eight. 

Once you have determined the shape, please format your answer as follows: <answer>(X) YourAnswer</answer>, where "X" represents the corresponding option letter, and YourAnswer is the name of the identified shape.

   prompt: Analyze the provided SVG path in the first sentence. This path consists of a series of commands and coordinates laid out in a specific sequence. To interpret it correctly, pay attention to both the number and order of detailed coordinates. While noting intersections, curves, turnings, and endpoints are essential, it's crucial to understand the spatial configuration and relationship between these elements. Make sure to identify whether there are parallel lines, symmetrical sections, or specific angle values that could give more insight into the shape's identity. Additionally, differentiate between curves, for instance, remember a circle has the same radius all around the center, while an ellipse has two different radii. Consider if the path returns to its starting point forming a closed shape, as it might be key to distinguish between different shapes with the same number of sides. After creating a mental visualization of the dynamic geometric shape that could be formed by following this path, select the most appropriate option from the given list which best represents your conclusions.

   prompt: Analyze the SVG path element given in the first sentence. Pay attention to the individual coordinates and the order of their sequence. Acknowledge that sharp turns, specifically those with 90 degrees or less, should be treated as marking two separate edges, not one. Emphasize on the path's intersections, curves, turnings, endpoints, and how line segments intersect. Also consider that the path might form complex shapes that integrate multiple simple shapes. Your task is not just to count individual lines but to visualize the corresponding geometric shape they form based on the coordinates and directions, including endpoints and turnings. Differentiate between curves: remember, an ellipse has two different radii while a circle has the same radius all around its center. When it comes to arcs, consider that two arcs with the same radii in the same path tend to form a circle, not an ellipse. Once you have analyzed and accurately visualized the shape, pick the most applicable option from the list provided. Remember, your answer must be present on the list.

   prompt: Thoroughly examine the SVG path element in the first sentence. Note every single coordinate and their sequence. Keep in mind that not all points necessarily form corners of the polygon. Be attentive to path's characteristics like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and the possibility of line segments colliding. Visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions - it could be elaborate or straightforward. Count all individual line sections and identify closed circuits that might suggest a shape. For curved shapes, differentiate between a circle and an ellipse by checking the radii for equality. If both radii are equal it denotes a circle, if not it's an ellipse. Also, remember that a path might return to a point which is not the starting point, still forming a closed shape. Upon analyzing and visualizing the shape, select the most fitting option based on your conclusion from the list provided.

   prompt: Analyze in detail the SVG path element in the opening sentence, noting each coordinate and the order in which they appear. It's important to understand that not all points necessarily form vertices of the polygon, but could also be part of curves or straight lines. Be thorough in examining the path, considering elements such as intersecting lines, rounds, changes in direction, start, and end points, and the potential for collision between line segments. From the coordinates and directional information given, visualize the constructed shape - this could range from simple geometric forms to more intricate designs. Identify all separate line segments and discern closed paths that might suggest the formation of a specific shape. In the case of curved shapes, distinguish between a circle and an ellipse by comparing the radii. If the radii are equal, then the shape is a circle; if different, it's an ellipse. Keep in mind that a path can loop back to a point other than the starting point and still form a closed figure. After evaluating and visualizing the shape, choose the closest geometric form to represent the figure from the list provided. Please make sure to wrap your selected answer between <answer> and </answer> tags. Special attention should be given to understand "M" as a "move to" command in the path string which does not indicate a new subpath but is part of the overall shape. Be cautious with polygons that have intersecting lines or disjointed segments as they might indicate a more complex shape or overlapping figures.

   prompt: Examine the SVG path element in the first sentence with precision, paying close attention to every coordinate and their ordered sequence. Keep in mind that not all points can be regarded as vertices. Notice the attributes of the path like intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and potential for colliding line segments. Construct a mental image of the entity represented by interpreting the coordinates and the sequence of movement. This formed shape could be either complex or simple. Document every line segment and recognize any closed loops that could indicate a particular shape. Should you encounter curved shapes, distinguish if it's a circle or an ellipse by comparing the radii - if they're exact a circle is formed, else it's an ellipse. Bear in mind, a path can return to a non-origin point while still maintaining a closed shape. Carefully inspect, project and interpret the shape, then select an option that you believe best matches the sketch based on your conclusion from the list provided. Whatever option you choose, be sure to place it between <answer> and </answer>. Also, consider the progress of lines while counting; remember that overlapping lines or backtracks on the same line should not be counted multiple times. For polygons, pay special attention to the number of unique vertices to distinguish shapes with different sides.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the SVG path element from the first sentence. Pay close attention to every unique coordinate and their ordered sequence. Note that it's the unique points that determine the corners of the potential polygon - so don't count repeated coordinates as separate corners. Consider the path's distinct characteristics such as intersections, curves, turns, endpoints, and evaluate whether any line segments intersect. Make an attempt to visualize the entity described by the coordinates and directions, which might be complex or simple. If there's a closed circuit, consider it as a potential shape, and remember that a path might loop back to a non-starting point, still encapsulating a shape. Identify polygons by the number of unique points in the SVG path, which will help in determining the correct geometric shape. For curved paths, infer if it's a circle or an ellipse by checking if both radii are equal (denoting a circle), or they have distinct values (indicating an ellipse). Make sure distinguished shapes forming when there is a consecutive sequence of moves ("M") and lines ("L") to ensure correct shape identification. After careful examination and visualizing the shape, select the most fitting answer from the given list based on your conclusion.

   prompt: In the first sentence, you are provided with an SVG path element. Your task is to deduce the exact geometric shape that this path represents. Carefully analyze the SVG path, paying close attention to all the coordinates and the direction of movement - these are crucial for reconstructing the abstract shape. The path might represent simple or complex geometric shapes, but it's essential to distinguish between a path comprising one single straight line and a path that forms distinct shapes with multiple lines, which could mark the boundaries of a two-dimensional object. 

Take into account every detail - the number of intersections, turns, and endpoints in the path. Consider the distinctive properties of each possible shape provided on the list, such as the difference in properties of a circle and an ellipse or between a triangle and a kite. Use this knowledge to visualize the geometric shape that the path represents.

After visualizing the shape, you have to express the shape accurately by choosing the most suitable option from the provided list. Each option is a different geometric shape, represented by a letter from (A) to (K). First, analyze each option in-depth, comparing its defining properties to those of the visualized shape. Next, choose the one that best matches the path. 

Finally, always cross-verify your choice. Ensure that all the properties of the chosen shape align perfectly with those depicted by the path. Once you have chosen and affirmed your answer, encapsulate the letter of your answer in <answer> and </answer> brackets. 

Note: Each SVG path may represent more complex shapes by connecting multiple individual line segments, rather than viewing the path only as a single continuous straight line. Also, ensure you are respecting the order of the points and the path direction in your answer. 

For instance, if you believe that the SVG path element represents a rectangle, and rectangle is option (H), your final answer should be <answer>(H) rectangle</answer>.

   prompt: Analyze the SVG path element in the first sentence. Remember, SVG paths employ several commands, such as "M" for moving the pen without inking, "L" to draw a line and "A" for an arc. Multiple "M" or "L" commands in a path don't necessarily mean independent shapes but can form a single complex shape. Take into account every detail - the coordinates, directionality, movement, curve, and turns. Envision the shape based on these details. Among the possible shapes are relatively simple ones like lines and triangles, as well as complex figures like circles, ovals, and various polygons. Some shapes may have similar characteristics, but their distinguishing properties, like the circularity of a circle vs. the elongation of an ellipse or the dimensions of a kite vs. a triangle, are critical. Do not merely visualize the shape; match it to the properties specified in the SVG path element. Choose the most accurate geometric shape from the options and provide your answer. Ensure your answer comes after the phrase "The SVG path element represents a". Also, remember to encapsulate your selected option between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Begin by analyzing the SVG path element revealed in the first sentence. Rather than simplifying it in any way, challenge yourself to visualize the possible complex shape it might characterize. Absorb every detail - the coordinates, their directionality, endpoints, intersections, and turns. Your consideration should cover a spectrum of shapes, from simple ones like lines and triangles to more complex ones like circles, ovals, and diverse polygons. It's crucial to remember that these shapes have defining properties, whether it's the difference between a circle and an elliptical shape, or between a heptagon and a hexagon, or between shapes like triangles and kites. This sort of meticulous shape discernment has to be employed when deciphering the SVG path element. Also, cross-check whether the properties and attributes that you discern from your visualized shape align with the details outlined in the SVG path element, especially the SVG commands and their nuances like the radius values in 'A' command.

   prompt: Given the SVG path element provided, your mission is to precisely identify the shape it represents. It is essential to understand how different SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') shape the outcome. Remember, not all 'A' commands create an ellipse, and multiple 'L' commands do not always form a line. The aesthetic of the shape is determined by the arrangement and connectivity of these points and lines, not just their count. Therefore, when analyzing the path, identify how many distinct points and lines there are but also contemplate how they come together to make the shape. 

An educated guess should dissect the pattern of SVG commands and their specific details rather than merely counting points. If despite your analysis, the shape isn't evident, state your uncertainty clearly. Such uncertain situations may arise when the connectivity of points doesn't clearly align with any of the options provided. Rather than forcing an incorrect prediction, acknowledge the ambiguity.

In conclusion, share the answer you deduce from your understanding of SVG commands and the displayed path. Don't forget to include the answer option flanked by <answer> and </answer> tags, even if you encounter uncertainty. Remember, an 'L' command lays a straight line between two points but the pattern these lines form can vary broadly, from triangles to hexagons, depending on the other SVG paths in the data.

   prompt: In your task, you are to interpret the provided SVG path element and identify the shape it creates from the available options. Make use of SVG path commands, 'M' to specify the start of a new sub-path and 'L' to indicate the connection of points by linear paths. Be aware that multiple 'L' commands can indicate an outline of a shape and not necessarily a line. It is crucial not to confuse the number of points with the number of vertices in the shape, nor confuse lines or points with the actual shape. Keep in mind that the shape suggests an enclosed space, distinct from mere lines or points. Critically analyze the entire SVG path data, considering the relationship between individual commands and how they collectively form the final shape. If the shape isn't immediately discernible, you can make an educated guess by evaluating factors such as the number of unique points, the implication of an enclosed space, and the relationship between certain commands. Be careful while guessing, ensure it's logical, considering attributes unique to potential shapes, and differentiate shapes by looking at the angles formed, not just the shared endpoints. Don't equate the number of 'L' commands directly to the sides of a shape, as complex or irregular shapes might be involved. Remember that multiple 'M' commands might signal separate sub-paths forming component parts of the shape and SVG paths can represent irregular shapes as well. Avoid making hasty decisions based on partial information. If you can't confidently make a guess, express that uncertainty is better than making an incorrect prediction.

   prompt: Your task is to decipher the shape represented by the provided SVG path element. Employ the SVG path commands, specifically the 'M' and 'L' commands, to understand the outline of the shape. The 'M' command starts a new sub-path, while 'L' connects points using lines. Be sure to examine the entire SVG path data, as the interplay of various commands shapes the final result. Keep in mind that an array of 'L' commands does not necessarily illustrate a line; it might suggest the linking of points delineating a more complex shape. The goal is to identify the space enclosed by these commands, not the number or arrangement of individual lines or points. Avoid misconstruing the quantity of points as the number of vertices in the shape. 

Should the shape prove elusive, make an informed assumption based on factors such as unique points, the creation of a closed space, and the synergy of specific command combinations. Apply a systematic approach to your estimation, looking at the distinct characteristics of possible shapes. Confirm your interpretation with the options provided. Remember, it is better to express uncertainty than to make an inaccurate prediction. Include your most suitable choice from the provided options, enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags at the conclusion of your response.

When examining the SVG path commands, consider that multiple 'M' commands can refer to disjoint sections of a single larger shape rather than separate entities. So, pay close attention when SVG path data contains multiple 'M' and 'L' commands, as they may create more complicated geometric figures or parts of a larger whole. Also, weigh the possibility that the commands may trace around the inside of the shape rather than following the direct path of the edges. Lastly, remember to carefully consider the concluding part of the SVG path data, which often contain clues including the closure of the outline. By considering these nuances, your analysis will be more robust and accurate.

To achieve this, understand and apply the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z'). Keep in mind that modifier commands 'M' and 'L' are crucial for identifying the start of a new path and for connecting points with lines, respectively. However, also pay attention to other commands like 'H', 'V', 'C', etc., as these profoundly impact the shape's formation. Make sure to count and understand the distinct points, not just the total commands or lines; remember that a path returning to its start point does not add a new distinct point. The same point can be called multiple times in a sequence. Don't overlook curved lines and loops by commands 'A', 'C', 'S', 'Q'. In particular, note that circles are special ellipses with equal X and Y radii. If you face problems in recognizing the shape, count the distinct points or lines and observe how they interconnect, keeping in mind the start and end points.

   prompt: In this task, you will receive an SVG path element and you are required to identify the shape it draws using the provided options. It's crucial to comprehend the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') and how they collectively interpret into a shape. Remember that the 'A' command represents arcs and does not automatically equate to an entire ellipse. Similarly participation of 'L' or any command alone doesn't necessarily mean the shape will be related to them directly. Be conscious that the path can be open (not forming a complete shape) or closed (forming a complete shape) and this is important for final conclusions. The number of points, lines, and their connectivity also can be important clues when the shape is not directly inferable. You should not feel pressured to make a definitive guess in case of uncertainty, it's better to express doubt over making an incorrect inference. An educated guess shouldn't solely rely on counting points and lines. A deeper understanding of how SVG commands form a path and how they potentially complete into a shape when interpreted together is necessary. Also consider the possibility that some shapes may be ruled out based on the commands used, so the process of elimination could also be helpful.

   prompt: In this task, you are presented with an SVG path element from which you must discern the shape being drawn. You must understand and apply SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z'), noting that the 'A' command represents arcs of an elliptical path and isn't exclusive to depicting complete shapes. Constrain your focus to the whole picture of the structure formed by these commands rather than concentrating solely on individual lines or segments. When faced with difficulty in challenging cases where the shape cannot be directly inferred from the path, remember that 'M' command sets a new starting point for subsequent commands. Even in the presence of unusual and ambiguous arrangements, strive to make an educated guess, which is an understanding derived from how the SVG commands collectively interact to form a path. Be reminded that a single 'L' command represents a line segment and multiple 'L' commands can portray various shapes. Hence, don't fall into the trap of seeing lines when complex shapes are formed. Also, keep in mind that answers should not be based solely on the counting of points or lines; a deeper understanding of how SVG commands form different shapes is essential. Be ready to express uncertainty when the shape is not entirely unique or recognizable. Your final answer should be based on a combination of these elements and should visualize the final shape from the command sequence.

   prompt: In this task, you're given an SVG path element and your aim is to determine the shape it signifies from the provided options. Dive deep into SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') to comprehend their role in shaping up the figure. Remember that 'A' command creates arcs, which may not give the full picture of the overall shape. If you struggle to identify the shape from the SVG path, consider the count of corners the figure has. This should be done with great precision to avoid any misinterpretation. You are advised to take the path's status, whether open or closed, into account as it might alter your interpretation. If the shape is complex and forms a unique pattern that's hard to decipher, do not hesitate to express uncertainty instead of yielding an incorrect answer. For educated guesswork, imagine the potential shape formed by the SVG commands, scrutinize the angles, asymmetry within the shape, and sequential relations and lengths of different lines. Don't rely solely on the count of lines or points. In the case of polygons (shapes with straight sides), consider whether the sides or angles are equal. Once you've determined the shape, mention the relevant response from the given options and enclose it within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: In this task, you're provided an SVG path element. Your goal is to identify what geometric shape it sketches out from the given alternatives. Use the SVG path commands 'M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', and 'Z' to understand what contributes to the formation of the shape. Be aware that 'A' commands delineate arcs, which might not fully describe the entire shape, especially in the context of multiple 'A' commands forming a cyclical path. If deciphering the shape directly from the SVG path becomes complex, resort to counting the sharp corners or vertices nested within the SVG commands, especially the commands like 'L', but maintain precision to prevent misinterpretation and incorrect shape identification. As SVG paths can be open-ended or closed, remember that this dichotomy could impact your perception of the shape. When confronted with a shape that does not adhere to common geometric patterns, voice your uncertainty instead of providing an incorrect answer. Endeavour to make an educated guess by visualizing the possible shape taking shape by SVG commands. Inspect the contained angles, asymmetry, the relative positioning of the lines, and the lengths of the lines, instead of merely relying on the count of points or vectors. When separate sections are defined using different 'M' commands, remember that these sections should not be considered as a single shape. After your thorough analysis, finalize the shape you believe has been described and ensure to state the corresponding answer from the provided options written down within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: For this exercise, you'll be supplied with an SVG path element, and your task is to identify the shape it constructs from the given alternatives. To accomplish this, comprehend how the SVG path commands ('M', 'L', 'H', 'V', 'C', 'S', 'Q', 'T', 'A', 'Z') interact to construct the shape. Particularly, keep in mind that 'A' commands establish arcs, which might not form the entirety of the shape. If you find it challenging to distinguish the shape directly from the SVG path, concentrate on counting the connected points, which represent corners of the shape, doing so accurately to prevent misinterpretation. Remember to heed the distinction between open and closed paths, as they may affect your decision. If the shape does not correlate to a conventional model and displays a distinctive pattern that is not readily identifiable, have the confidence to express your uncertainty rather than providing an incorrect choice. Rather than relying solely on counting points or lines, understanding the SVG path commands, their use and correlation in forming the shape will lead to a more educated guess. Finally, after deciding on the shape, clearly express your answer from the provided choices within <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Your task is to interpret an SVG path element provided herein and identify the geometric figure it represents. While doing this, it's essential to count the unique points in the path and correlate them to form a shape. Remember, a geometric shape is determined by its vertices or unique points: a point for a dot; two points for a line; three for a triangle; four for a rectangle, square, or trapezoid and so on. If the number of points or lines described in the path element doesn't directly indicate a common geometric shape, then make an educated guess based on this information. Once you've determined the identified shape, place your answer's option number between <answer> and </answer> tags. An SVG path element essentially describes a shape by plotting points in a 2D space, and the path data is listed as commands and coordinates within the element. The commands include:

- M for move to, which moves the 'pen' to a new position.
- L for line to, which draws a line from the current point to a new point.
Consider this guide while interpreting the SVG path element.

Study the list of options provided and choose the one that best fits your interpretation of the geometric shape visualized by the SVG path element. Do remember that comprehending the SVG path in detail is the key to accurately identifying the shape.

   prompt: In an SVG path, each 'M' (move) and 'L' (line) command contributes to forming a shape. When rendered, these sequences of commands collectively create a specific geometric shape. However, keep in mind that you need to understand the relationships between these move and line commands textually, not visually. Please evaluate the textual information of the SVG path and determine which shape it signifies. Each SVG path will contain a series of 'M' and 'L' commands, with different coordinates. Your task is to analyze this series of text, consider the count and sequence of lines and their corresponding angles, and determine the shape it reflects. 

Consider these possibilities: 
(A) circle
(B) heptagon
(C) hexagon
(D) kite
(E) line
(F) octagon
(G) pentagon
(H) rectangle

   prompt: You are supplied with an SVG path element which, when interpreted, forms a specific geometric shape. The structure of the shape is determined by the Move (M) and Line (L) commands contained in the path. It's essential to appraise and comprehend these commands in a holistic manner to identify the resultant shape. Remember, the number of lines alone doesn't define the shape, the way they connect and form angles also plays a crucial role. For instance, if we consider the SVG path <path d="M 31.84,9.21 L 39.79,23.26 L 46.03,19.73 L 38.09,5.68 M 38.09,5.68 L 31.84,9.21"/>, it would render a kite shape having 4 sides with two distinct pairs of adjacent sides.
