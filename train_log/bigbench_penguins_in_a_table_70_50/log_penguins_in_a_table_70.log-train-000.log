The model's response is: 
There are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg: Louis and Gwen. 

Therefore, the answer is <(B) 2>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis
In this example, even though the model correctly identifies the penguin that is 9 years old as Vincent, it incorrectly predicts the answer as E, which essentially means it predicts an option 'James', which doesn't correspond to any penguin in the given table. This error can be due to a model malfunction rather than a problem in the prompt because the model has actually identified the correct answer before making the incorrect prediction.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis
The model wrongly gets the total number of animals more than 5 years old. The correct answer should be 5 but the model's response is 7. Model counted correctly but probably got confused with the operations to perform, in this case getting the count of animals older than 5 years. It could be that the model fails to distinguish between lines of text and lines in the table and therefore fails to count correctly.

<3> Wrong Example Analysis
In this example, the model incorrectly predicted the number of penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. It counted Bernard, even though it clearly states in the question that Bernard has been deleted from the table. This suggests that the model has a lag or can't accurately keep track of changes made within the data.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Clarification: The model appears to have trouble maintaining updates and changes in the data. Improving prompts to be more specific and indicating changes in data may help.
2. Purpose Specification: The model seems to be performing operations that are not expressed in the prompt or the question. The purpose of the task should be made clearer.
3. Data Presentation: The model's failures in Examples 2 and 3 indicate that it's not interpreting the data correctly. Tweaking how data is presented or parsed might fix this issue.
4. Question Structure: In Example 3, the model didn't interpret the question correctly, thus leading to a wrong answer. It might help to provide guidelines on how to interpret and respond to complex question structures.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
The question asked is "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?" The model incorrectly counted all the penguins as they were all indeed over 5 years. However, the question specifically asked for penguins that are "more than 5 years old." This indicates that the penguins being counted should be older than 5, not including those that are exactly 5 years. This discrepancy likely led the model to choose the wrong answer option. 

<2> 
The question asked is "What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?" The model incorrectly identified "James" as the last penguin when sorted alphabetically, even though the correct answer should have been "Vincent". This indicates that there was an error in the way the model sorted the names alphabetically.

<3> 
The question asked is "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?" Similar to the first example, the model incorrectly counted a giraffe that was exactly 5 years old. The wording in the question "more than 5 years old" excludes giraffes that are exactly 5 years old.

Improvements: 
1. The prompt could provide more clarity in the instructions to ensure that details in the question such as "more than" are not overlooked. This would help the model understand the nuances in question phrasing and handle edge cases better.
2. The prompt should instruct the model to double-check its sorting mechanisms, or the prompt could provide more explicit instructions on how to sort the names.
3. The model seems to be misunderstanding the meaning of comparisons such as "more than". To address this, we could include examples in the prompt where the model is trained on correctly handling such comparison phrases.
4. The model's training could also be improved to better understand instructions and contextual information. For example, understanding that the age considered as input should be >5, not >=5 in the above examples.
5. The prompt could more clearly specify how the model should present answers, specifying that the output should consist of an evaluation of the answer options based on the data given.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

The mistake here seems to occur in the model's data processing and interpretation. The model failed to consider the instruction that "We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table." Bernard, who is 5 years old, should be excluded from the count of penguins less than 8 years old, leaving only Louis, who is 7 years old. Therefore, the correct answer should be 1 (Option A), not 2. This issue reflects a lack of problem-solving capability or some failure to properly incorporate context into the answer, which might not be directly related to the prompt itself, but rather stems from the model's comprehension skills.

Wrong Example 2:

The error in this example lies in incorrectly identifying the oldest giraffe. According to the table, Gladys is the oldest giraffe, not Donna. It's not clear why the model made this error, but it may be due to a processing mistake or inability to properly interpret the information. However, the problem might also be the wording of the prompt, which does not specify what kind of questions about "causal attribution" need to be answered.

Improvements:

1. Clarify the Task: "Causal attribution" is a potential source of misunderstanding. It generally refers to determining the cause or reason behind an event, which does not clearly convey the task of extracting specific details from a given dataset. The prompt should clarify this aspect, for example, "Answer questions based on given datasets".

2. Data Contextualization: If possible, more concrete information related to the context of the data should be provided in the prompt to guide the model's understanding.

3. Problem Specification: Each problem could be specified in the prompt, which might support the model in applying different strategies for different types of questions.

4. Guided Instructions: For tasks like excluding or adding items to the presented datasets, guiding instructions could be provided within the prompt.

5. Clear Options: For multiple-choice questions, the model needs to be informed that it should state its response specifically as the option (A, B, C, D or E) and not in any other format.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. In the first example, where the giraffes are being sorted by alphabetical order, the model gets it wrong by choosing (D) Donna as the answer. The confusion here could be due to the way the task is phrased. The term 'last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order' could have possibly been misunderstood by the model as referring to the last name mentioned in the list before the sorting operation was to be implemented. By this interpretation, the model would have arrived at Donna being the last name mentioned. However, the correct interpretation of this task would involve sorting the names in alphabetical order first, then identifying the last name in the list, which would have been (E) Louise.

2. In the second example, the model incorrectly answered with (B) 2 when deciphering how many penguins are more than 8 years old. The model somehow included Gwen, who is exactly 8 years old, in the count. This error could be attributed to the model's unclear understanding 'more than', which only pertains to age greater than 8 and not equal to 8. 

To revise the prompt based on these observations, we could consider the following tips:
1. Use clear and unambiguous language to denote the task, For example, instead of 'the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order', consider 'the last giraffe in alphabetic order when all the names are sorted'. 
2. Clearer instruction with respect to understanding relational phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to'. Include in the prompt phrases like 'Remember that 'more than' doesn't include the number itself, only numbers higher than it' or 'Mind the wording. 'More than 8 years old' excludes penguins who are exactly 8 years old'. 
3. Emphasize on the double-checking of computations and the evaluation based on information provided. Perhaps the prompt could be updated to say something like 'Double-check your computations and your understanding of the question before responding.'
4. Reiterate the importance of careful sorting. A part of the prompt could encourage 'Be extra thorough when managing any sorting tasks. Sorting should be based strictly on the specified parameter.'

Example 1:
Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Model's Answer: There are two penguins less than 8 years old: Louis (7 years old) and Bernard (5 years old) before he was deleted from the table. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.
Correct Answer: A (1)

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The main issue the model encountered here is the inappropriate retention of deleted table data, i.e., the age of the penguin named Bernard. Despite the explicit instruction to delete Bernard's information, the model still considered Bernard while determining the number of penguins less than 8 years old. Consequently, this led the model to an incorrect outcome of two penguins instead of the correct answer of one.

The prompts could be improved by detailing instructions to take table adjustments such as deletions or additions into account while interpreting data for subsequent tasks. The model also needs to be instructed to discard any data related to removed entries entirely. 

Enhanced Prompt:
Analyze the provided data carefully and ensure accuracy in handling additions or removals to the data set. When changes are made, completely discard the data related to removed entries and update calculations accordingly. Continue focusing on correctly interpreting comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and tackle sorting tasks accurately when required. Frame your answers based on an explicit evaluation of the options. Double-check your computations before responding, considering all the changes made to the data set. After completing your answer, ensure that the final correct answer is bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are two penguins less than 8 years old: Louis (7 years old) and Bernard (5 years old) before he was deleted from the table.
Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:
Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Model's Answer: There are two penguins less than 8 years old: Louis (7 years old) and Bernard (5 years old) before he was deleted from the table. Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.
Correct Answer: A (1)

Reason for Incorrect Answer:
The main issue the model encountered here is the inappropriate retention of deleted table data, i.e., the age of the penguin named Bernard. Despite the explicit instruction to delete Bernard's information, the model still considered Bernard while determining the number of penguins less than 8 years old. Consequently, this led the model to an incorrect outcome of two penguins instead of the correct answer of one.

The prompts could be improved by detailing instructions to take table adjustments such as deletions or additions into account while interpreting data for subsequent tasks. The model also needs to be instructed to discard any data related to removed entries entirely. 

Enhanced Prompt:
Analyze the provided data carefully and ensure accuracy in handling additions or removals to the data set. When changes are made, completely discard the data related to removed entries and update calculations accordingly. Continue focusing on correctly interpreting comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and tackle sorting tasks accurately when required. Frame your answers based on an explicit evaluation of the options. Double-check your computations before responding, considering all the changes made to the data set. After completing your answer, ensure that the final correct answer is bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Examining the question and the model's response, it seems that the language model has misinterpreted the 'and' as an 'or' in the question. While Bernard and Gwen are above 5 years and 12 kg, only Gwen meets both conditions. This shows that the model has not been able to accurately understand compound comparison phrases.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model fails to correctly apply the deletion of the record for Bernard. While Bernard would have originally met the conditions stated in the question, his removal from the table means that only Louis matches the criteria. This suggests that the model has difficulty tracking and applying changes to the input data.

Improvements:

1. Clarity: Make sure the model understands when multiple conditions must all be met by the same entity. For example, specify that every condition must be fulfilled by each individual entity, e.g., "Consider a penguin to meet the criteria only if it satisfies all the given conditions."

2. Update handling: Train the model to handle updates to the input, such as deletions or additions. Make sure to clarify this in the prompt, e.g., "Any changes, additions, or deletions to the table over time should be correctly factored into the computations."

3. Comparison phrases: Further stress the importance of correctly interpreting comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc.

4. Answer formatting: The answer presentation in the second example is inconsistent with the format outlined in the prompt. The prompt should explicitly mention that only the right answer should be framed between the brackets, without any other text, e.g., "Remember to place ONLY the correct answer between the given brackets (<answer> and </answer>)"

5. Comprehensive Check: Advice the model to perform a comprehensive check that takes into account all relevant information in the task, especially when dealing with multiple conditions. For example, "Ensure that you examine all entities and conditions thoroughly, and cross-verify the available options before giving the final answer."

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model incorrectly answered (B) 2, while the correct answer should be (A) 1. 

Three key issues can be observed here:

a) Misinterpretation of comparisons: The model didn't correctly analyze the question which is asking for penguins that are 'less than 8 years old' and 'weigh less than 12 kg'. Instead, it seems the model incorrectly interpreted the requirement as penguins that are less than 9 years old, which led to the inclusion of Vincent (who is 9 years old) along with Louis. This falls under misunderstanding of comparative terms, which was stated as a crucial understanding in the prompt.

b) Misinterpretation of conjunctions: The question asked for penguins who satisfy both conditions, i.e., those who are both under 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg, it seems the model didn't account for the AND conjunction and perhaps viewed the conditions independently. 

c) Inaccurate verification: The prompt asks the model to double-check computations and question understanding before answering, but it seems that the model didn’t re-check its interpretation against the original table data before responding.

<2> 
In this example, the model incorrectly answered (D) Donna, while the correct answer should have been (C) Marian for the question asking for the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order.

Main points to analyze here:

a) Alphabetical understanding: The model does not seem to understand the concept of "alphabetic order" correctly. In alphabetic order, Marian should be the last, but the model sorted the names in reverse order, making Donna the last name. This error signifies an improper understanding of sorting tasks as highlighted in the prompt.

To improve the prompt, it should:

1) Emphasize better the importance of correctly interpreting comparative terms like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and the like. The current wording about not including the number specified (like '8' in 'more than 8') should be clarified further.

2) Explicitly ask the model to carefully consider the function of conjunctions in the task (for instance, the word 'and' in the question), as it can change the meaning and parameters of the task.

3) Reinforce the necessity of understanding 'sorting tasks'. The model needs to be programmed to fully understand the meaning of 'alphabetical order', which currently seems to be misrepresented.

4) Include a reminder to cross-reference the original data during the double-check phase. Despite the existing call to perform a 'thorough double-check', the model failed to realize its errors, possibly due to not referring back to the original table.

5) Improve the understanding of question phrasing as sometimes literal interpretation can lead to wrong responses.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are two penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg: Louis and Vincent. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(B) 2</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The model's input is:
Carefully analyze the data provided, correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., making sure to understand the precise meanings of these terms. For example, 'more than 8' does not include the number 8 itself. Manage sorting tasks meticulously, ensuring to sort the data based on the requested parameter. Evaluate the answer options provided thoroughly and make sure your responses consider each one. Prior to responding, perform a thorough double-check of your computations as well as your understanding of the question posed.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is:

Jody
Gladys
Marian
Donna

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna. 

<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this example, the model incorrectly answered (B) 2, while the correct answer should be (A) 1. 

Three key issues can be observed here:

a) Misinterpretation of comparisons: The model didn't correctly analyze the question which is asking for penguins that are 'less than 8 years old' and 'weigh less than 12 kg'. Instead, it seems the model incorrectly interpreted the requirement as penguins that are less than 9 years old, which led to the inclusion of Vincent (who is 9 years old) along with Louis. This falls under misunderstanding of comparative terms, which was stated as a crucial understanding in the prompt.

b) Misinterpretation of conjunctions: The question asked for penguins who satisfy both conditions, i.e., those who are both under 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg, it seems the model didn't account for the AND conjunction and perhaps viewed the conditions independently. 

c) Inaccurate verification: The prompt asks the model to double-check computations and question understanding before answering, but it seems that the model didn’t re-check its interpretation against the original table data before responding.

<2> 
In this example, the model incorrectly answered (D) Donna, while the correct answer should have been (C) Marian for the question asking for the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order.

Main points to analyze here:

a) Alphabetical understanding: The model does not seem to understand the concept of "alphabetic order" correctly. In alphabetic order, Marian should be the last, but the model sorted the names in reverse order, making Donna the last name. This error signifies an improper understanding of sorting tasks as highlighted in the prompt.

To improve the prompt, it should:

1) Emphasize better the importance of correctly interpreting comparative terms like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and the like. The current wording about not including the number specified (like '8' in 'more than 8') should be clarified further.

2) Explicitly ask the model to carefully consider the function of conjunctions in the task (for instance, the word 'and' in the question), as it can change the meaning and parameters of the task.

3) Reinforce the necessity of understanding 'sorting tasks'. The model needs to be programmed to fully understand the meaning of 'alphabetical order', which currently seems to be misrepresented.

4) Include a reminder to cross-reference the original data during the double-check phase. Despite the existing call to perform a 'thorough double-check', the model failed to realize its errors, possibly due to not referring back to the original table.

5) Improve the understanding of question phrasing as sometimes literal interpretation can lead to wrong responses.

Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Analyzing the data provided:
- Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Bernard is 5 years old and weighs 13 kg.
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg.

After deleting Bernard from the table, we have:
- Louis: 7 years old, 11 kg
- Vincent: 9 years old, 11 kg
- Gwen: 8 years old, 15 kg
- James: 12 years old, 12 kg

Now, we need to find penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg:
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg.

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Incorrect Model Response: <answer>(B) 2</answer>.
Correct answer: A

Analysis:
The model answered the question incorrectly because it failed to strictly follow the comparison phrase "more than". Specifically, "more than 12 kg" implies a weight of above 12 kg, but the model incorrectly counted James, who weighs exactly 12 kg. This is likely due to an misunderstanding of the term "more than", which does not include the number itself, as stated in the original prompt. 

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Emphasize the precision of the comparison phrases: In the current prompt, the example used 'more than 8' does not include the number 8 itself. It is necessary to elaborate more with examples with different values and units (e.g., weight in kg).

2. Ensure data operation accuracy: The model correctly removed the penguin Bernard from the data set but incorrectly treated James' weight as >12 kg. It's essential to stress adherence to precise comparison phrase interpretation when performing data operations.

3. Strengthen attention to detail: The model didn't strictly follow 'more than' and included James whose weight is equal to 12 kg, emphasizing the need of paying more specific attention to critical points in the question is necessary.

4. Reiterate verification: Even after mentioning the necessity of double-checking computations, a misinterpretation occurred. Hence, the prompt should encourage the model to verify its understanding and computations at each critical point during data processing. 

5. Insist on correct answer format: Although the model correctly provided the answer within tags, it got the answer wrong. A clause can be added to the prompt to highlight that correctly applying the instruction is useless if the result is incorrect.

Based on the analysis of mistakes and improvements, here is the revised prompt:
"Prioritize understanding the comparison phrases 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. where 'more than' does not include the precise number mentioned. For instance, 'more than 12 kg' implies a weight of above 12kg and does not include 12kg. Perform the tasks of adding and removing data meticulously. Before responding, return to verify whether the computations and interpretations align with the question requirements. Each step, including the calculations and the final response, should be rechecked to avoid misinterpretations and errors. Once you're sure of the correct answer, format it within tags <answer> and </answer>. However, bear in mind that the correctness of the answer is of utmost importance and meticulousness in the answer format becomes futile if the answer is incorrect."

Carefully analyze the data provided, correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., making sure to understand the precise meanings of these terms. For example, 'more than 8' does not include the number 8 itself. Manage sorting tasks meticulously, ensuring to sort the data based on the requested parameter. Evaluate the answer options provided thoroughly and make sure your responses consider each one. Prior to responding, perform a thorough double-check of your computations as well as your understanding of the question posed. The correct answer should be precisely identified, and formatted within tags, for example, <answer> and </answer>.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 penguins who are more than 8 years old: Louis (7), Vincent (9), and Gwen (8). Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the question asks "How many animals are more than 5 years old?". Despite the prompt clearly stating that "more than 5 years old" excludes 5 itself, the model incorrectly includes Bernard from the penguin table who is exactly 5 years old when computing its answer. This suggests that it did not properly interpret the phrase "more than". As a consequence, it selects option (C) 7 instead of the correct answer of (B) 6.

Examining Wrong Example 2:
In the second example, the model was asked to identify how many penguins are "more than 8 years old". However, it makes a similar mistake as in example 1 by including Gwen, who is exactly 8 years old, in its calculations. In addition, it incorrectly assumes Louis to be 9 years old instead of correctly interpreting it as being 7 years old. As a result, it selects option (C) 3 instead of the correct option (A) 1.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:
1. Misinterpretation of the phrase "more than": The AI was unable to properly understand that "more than X" excludes the actual value of X.
2. Errors in data analysis: The AI incorrectly interpreted Louis's age, demonstrating an error in data evaluation.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. More emphasis on correctly interpreting comparison phrases: It is essential to amplify the importance of not including the actual comparison value in quantities being considered.
2. Highlight the need for accurate data interpretation and objectivity: Encourage the AI to confirm individual data points and avoid assumptions.
3. Related to example 2, the prompt should make it clear to AI should be flexible enough to adapt changes to dataset, in this case deletion of data. 
4. Reinforce the importance of cross-checking information: Proposed a triple-check where AI should compare its results with the data source to confirm accuracy. 
5. Include more explicit instructions for edge cases such as "equal to" and the boundary conditions around it to make AI's understanding more concrete. For example, "8 years and more" compared to "more than 8 years".

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the data provided, correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., making sure to understand the precise meanings of these terms. For example, 'more than 8' does not include the number 8 itself. Manage sorting tasks meticulously, ensuring to sort the data based on the requested parameter.

Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590

How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the penguin table, there are 5 penguins listed. Out of these, 4 penguins are more than 5 years old (Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, and James).

In the giraffe table, there are 4 giraffes listed. Out of these, 3 giraffes are more than 5 years old (Jody, Gladys, and Donna).

Therefore, the total number of animals that are more than 5 years old is 4 (penguins) + 3 (giraffes) = 7.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) 7</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.

gradient:
Incorrect Example 1:
Question: How many giraffes are there in the tables?
Incorrect Model Answer: <answer>(B) 2</answer>
Correct Answer: D

Reasoning: There is an error in the model’s calculation, evident from its answer. Given that the second table had four giraffes, the model answer should have been 4, not 2. It seems to have miscounted the rows in the data provided accounting for giraffes.

This mistake could possibly have resulted from the model misunderstanding the prompt's request to 'rigorously double-check your calculations and interpretations at each step of the task'. Perhaps it inferred that it needed to double-check, but incorrectly interpreted this as needing to divide the count by two. Alternatively, it might simply have misread the dataset or made a basic counting error.

The prompt might also be confusing the model with the emphasis it puts on comparison phrases and their strict interpretations. The example given in the prompt, 'more than 12 kg', doesn't relate to the question about counting, and might mislead the model by suggesting it has to apply some comparison.

Improvements:
1. Instead of focusing on comparison phrases in the prompt, the instruction can be more general and inclusive of different kinds of data analysis tasks, such as counting, comparing, or evaluating data. 

2. Make sure instructions about calculations are clear and avoid potentially confusing language such as 'double-check'. 

3. Include examples of different types of tasks in the prompt to help the model understand how to approach a variety of questions.

4. Ensure that instructions about formatting and ensuring the correct answer are clear but don't distract from the main task of analyzing the data and answering the question.

5. Remove the detailed explanation about 'more than', 'less than', etc., as not all questions would require comparison using these terms. 

6. The prompt could direct the model to pay close attention to the specific question asked and the data given, to ensure it doesn't misread or overlook any information.

Also, consider changes in units and know that a change in a data unit should reflect accurately across your data set. Thoroughly assess all provided options before yielding a response, ensuring the answer is consistent with the question's requirements. Where necessary, perform arithmetic operations diligently and verify your computations and comprehension of the question at each step. When confident of your answer's accuracy, present it within the tags <answer> and </answer>. Pay emphasis on two things - the correctness of your answer and adhering to the proper formatting.

The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the task asks "how many giraffes are more than 5 years old?". The model misunderstood the comparison phrase 'more than', as it included the giraffes aged exactly 5 years old in its count, contrary to the directions in the prompt. Consequently, the model counted Jody (5 years), Gladys (10 years), and Donna (9 years), giving a total of three giraffes, which is incorrect. The prompt explicitly states that 'more than' does not include the actual number mentioned, thus giraffes exactly 5 years old should not have been counted. The correct answer should have been 2 (Gladys and Donna), which is indicated by option (B) 2.

<2> 
In the second example, the task asks "how many penguins are less than 10 years old?". The model misunderstood the comparison phrase 'less than', as it excluded penguins aged exactly 10 years old from its count, which was consistent with the directions in the prompt. However, the model incorrectly counted only Louis (7 years old) and Bernard (5 years old), neglecting Vincent (9 years old) and Gwen (8 years old). The correct answer should have been 4, option (D) 4.

The reasons for the incorrect answers include:
1. Misinterpretation of the comparison phrase 'more than' which led to the inclusion of the boundary value in the count.
2. Failure to properly evaluate all the data provided, as demonstrated in the second example where the model did not include all penguins that were less than 10 years old.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. The prompt’s indication that comparison phrases 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., do not include the actual number they border should be emphasized. 
2. Add clear examples demonstrating the comparison terms 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to' to provide more clarity.
3. The prompt should encourage the model to carefully evaluate all entries in the provided data, ensuring no information is missed during its analysis.
4. Implement checks within the prompt to ensure the model understands the task properly and is analyzing the data correctly.

gradient:
<1>Analysis:
The model's input was to analyze penguin data and to add a penguin to the list before making a calculation on penguins less than 8 years old and less than 12 kg in weight. The question asked: "How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weight less than 12 kg?" 

The model's response was incorrect. It selected option B (2) when the correct answer was option A (1). The model's mistake was that it included a penguin that was exactly 8 years old (Vincent), despite the prompt emphasizing that phrases such as 'less than' do not include the number they border. 

Key Issue: The model failed to apply the instruction about comparison phrases like 'less than'.

<2>Analysis:
The model's input was to analyze giraffe data and to calculate the cumulative age of the giraffes. 

The model's response was incorrect due to a formatting error. It responded with "(26)" when the response should have been formatted as <answer>(A)</answer> or <answer>(A) 26</answer>. 

Key Issue: The model failed to properly apply the formatting rules specified in the prompt.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Emphasize and clarify the use of comparison phrases: While the prompt explains the use of comparison phrases, it may need to emphasize and ensure the model's full understanding of this crucial detail.
  
2. Provide an explicit reminder to adhere to answer formatting: The prompt already asks for the answer to be enclosed within <answer> and </answer> tags, but this must be reiterated and made more explicit. The model needs to understand the importance of following this format.

3. Include ample examples: Including more examples commonly aids understanding. Prompt should provide examples for different scenarios and edge cases, such as those involving comparison phrases and formatting rules.

4. Encourage Cross-Checking: In the first case, the model made a mistake by including a value that should have been excluded. It might be helpful to rephrase the prompt to encourage the model to cross-check its work more carefully, particularly when the question involves comparison operators.

5. Final answer form: The prompt could state clearly that responses should include both the option letter and the corresponding value to avoid confusion.

6. Elaborate prompt instructions: Break down lengthy instructions into smaller parts or shorter sentences, making them easier to absorb. The current prompt is a long paragraph, which might make important details easily skipped.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Examine the data provided meticulously and comprehend comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., taking into account that these terms do not include the actual number that they border. For instance, if we say 'more than 12 kg', it means a weight strictly above 12 kg, not including 12 kg itself. Be careful when manipulating data, when a unit is added, or removed, be sure to mirror the same on your data set reliably. Furthermore, evaluate all potential responses comprehensively to ensure that your reply considers all options provided. Rigorously double-check your calculations and interpretations at each step of the task, making sure they are consistent with the requirements of the question. When convinced of the accuracy of your computations and your understanding of the question, communicate your answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. However, keep in mind, correctness of the answer takes precedence, and all efforts in formatting would be unproductive unless the answer is correct.

What is the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The height of the penguins is given in centimeters. To convert 0.6 m to cm, we multiply by 100: 0.6 m = 0.6 * 100 = 60 cm.

From the table, we see that Bernard is the penguin with a height of 80 cm, which is greater than 60 cm. Therefore, the penguin with a height of 0.6 m (60 cm) is not Bernard.

Therefore, the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin is not Bernard, Louis, Vincent, or Gwen. The only option left is (E) James.

Therefore, the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin is James. 

<answer>(E) James</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question that the example is asking: "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?"

Reason why the answer is wrong: The model includes the giraffe aged "5" in the tally, ignoring the explicit instruction provided in the prompt that "more than 5" implies numbers strictly above 5, not including 5 itself.

<2> 
Question that the example is asking: "What is the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin?"

Reason why the answer is wrong: The model effectively converts the measure from meters to centimeters, and properly identifies the penguin name linked with height 60 cm. However, it eliminates all options and defaults to the remaining name rather than specifically pinpointing Vincent. This suggests a possible issue of understandability, in which the model has not grasped the full intent of the question.

<3> 
Question that the example is asking: "What is the name of the last giraffe sorted alphabetically?"

Reason why the answer is wrong: The model appears to misinterpret the question. The model sees "Donna" as the last giraffe listed alphabetically in the provided data, but the question is asking for the last giraffe when alphabetized with all the available options, which would be Marian.

To improve the prompt:
1. Make it clear that 'more than' and 'less than' don't include the actual number specified. Include examples to reinforce this concept.
2. More scenarios and examples should be given to prepare models to understand and handle a wider range of tasks such as sorting data alphabetically, data conversion, etc.
3. Emphasize data processing should consider all available options, not just from a single data set. A comprehensive evaluation of all response options is crucial.
4. Incorporate detailed and specific language about how to choose the correct answer from the provided options.
5. Encourage the model to refer back to specific data when providing answers (e.g., identifying the penguin named Vincent as being 0.6 meters tall, instead of excluding all others and choosing what's left).
6. Add more guidance about maintaining careful attention to detail, as small misunderstandings can change the entire output.

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are three giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody (5), Gladys (10), and Donna (9).
Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Carefully interpret the data provided, paying special attention to comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Remember that when we say 'more than 5', we mean strictly numbers above 5 and not including 5 itself. Similarly, 'less than 5' means strictly numbers below 5 and not including 5 itself. For example, if the data refers to the age of animals and the task asks 'how many animals are more than 5 years old?' an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Accurately handle data manipulation tasks such as adding or removing units; ensure to reflect the same changes accurately on your data set. Extensively evaluate all response options provided, and check that your answer encompasses all potential options. It's critical to double-check your calculations and interpretations at each stage of the task to ensure they align with the requirements. Test your understanding by re-engaging with the question at hand before committing to your answer. Once you are confident about the accuracy of your computations, communicate your answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. Remember, it is the correctness of your response that matters the most, efforts to format or optimize the answer would be ineffectual unless it's correct.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
What is the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The height of the penguins is given in centimeters. To convert 0.6 m to cm, we multiply by 100: 0.6 m = 0.6 * 100 = 60 cm.

From the table, we see that Bernard is the penguin with a height of 80 cm, which is greater than 60 cm. Therefore, the penguin with a height of 0.6 m (60 cm) is not Bernard.

Therefore, the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin is not Bernard, Louis, Vincent, or Gwen. The only option left is (E) James.

Therefore, the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin is James. 

<answer>(E) James</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: E.

What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question that the example is asking: "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?"

Reason why the answer is wrong: The model includes the giraffe aged "5" in the tally, ignoring the explicit instruction provided in the prompt that "more than 5" implies numbers strictly above 5, not including 5 itself.

<2> 
Question that the example is asking: "What is the name of the 0.6 m tall penguin?"

Reason why the answer is wrong: The model effectively converts the measure from meters to centimeters, and properly identifies the penguin name linked with height 60 cm. However, it eliminates all options and defaults to the remaining name rather than specifically pinpointing Vincent. This suggests a possible issue of understandability, in which the model has not grasped the full intent of the question.

<3> 
Question that the example is asking: "What is the name of the last giraffe sorted alphabetically?"

Reason why the answer is wrong: The model appears to misinterpret the question. The model sees "Donna" as the last giraffe listed alphabetically in the provided data, but the question is asking for the last giraffe when alphabetized with all the available options, which would be Marian.

To improve the prompt:
1. Make it clear that 'more than' and 'less than' don't include the actual number specified. Include examples to reinforce this concept.
2. More scenarios and examples should be given to prepare models to understand and handle a wider range of tasks such as sorting data alphabetically, data conversion, etc.
3. Emphasize data processing should consider all available options, not just from a single data set. A comprehensive evaluation of all response options is crucial.
4. Incorporate detailed and specific language about how to choose the correct answer from the provided options.
5. Encourage the model to refer back to specific data when providing answers (e.g., identifying the penguin named Vincent as being 0.6 meters tall, instead of excluding all others and choosing what's left).
6. Add more guidance about maintaining careful attention to detail, as small misunderstandings can change the entire output.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided information and answer questions with a particular focus on understanding and correctly interpreting comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Accurately handle sorting tasks when required, and ensure that the answers to any questions given are framed based on explicit evaluation of the options provided. Always double-check your computations before responding and then format your response to show the correct answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the data provided, correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., making sure to understand the precise meanings of these terms. For example, 'more than 8' does not include the number 8 itself. Manage sorting tasks meticulously, ensuring to sort the data based on the requested parameter. Evaluate the answer options provided thoroughly and make sure your responses consider each one. Prior to responding, perform a thorough double-check of your computations as well as your understanding of the question posed. The correct answer should be precisely identified, and formatted within tags, for example, <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Examine the data provided meticulously and comprehend comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., taking into account that these terms do not include the actual number that they border. For instance, if we say 'more than 12 kg', it means a weight strictly above 12 kg, not including 12 kg itself. Be careful when manipulating data, when a unit is added, or removed, be sure to mirror the same on your data set reliably. Furthermore, evaluate all potential responses comprehensively to ensure that your reply considers all options provided. Rigorously double-check your calculations and interpretations at each step of the task, making sure they are consistent with the requirements of the question. When convinced of the accuracy of your computations and your understanding of the question, communicate your answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. However, keep in mind, correctness of the answer takes precedence, and all efforts in formatting would be unproductive unless the answer is correct.
(4) Carefully interpret the data provided, paying special attention to comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Remember that when we say 'more than 5', we mean strictly numbers above 5 and not including 5 itself. Similarly, 'less than 5' means strictly numbers below 5 and not including 5 itself. For example, if the data refers to the age of animals and the task asks 'how many animals are more than 5 years old?' an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Accurately handle data manipulation tasks such as adding or removing units; ensure to reflect the same changes accurately on your data set. Extensively evaluate all response options provided, and check that your answer encompasses all potential options. It's critical to double-check your calculations and interpretations at each stage of the task to ensure they align with the requirements.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 

Wrong Answer Reasoning:
This error seems to be caused by a lack of understanding of alphabetical order or a mistake in executing the sort operation. The prompt does correctly state the importance of accuracy in processing data and in assessing the options. However, it does not provide specific guidance on handling tasks that involve sorting or arranging data.

Example 2:

Wrong Answer Reasoning:
In this case, misinterpretation of the phrase 'more than' seems to be the error. This might be due to language ambiguity. While the prompt does technically explain what 'more than' means, this is done in the context of a comparison phrase among several others and might not be given due importance.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Language Clarity: The explanation of comparison phrases could be expanded upon and emphasized more. Perhaps a separate section could be dedicated to addressing the meaning and handling of phrases like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to'.

2. Specific Guidance on Sorting Tasks: The prompt could include explicit instructions or guidance about handling tasks that involve arranging or sorting data, as these are a common type of data manipulation task.

3. Reinforcing Instructions: The importance of following specific task instructions could be reinforced. For example, in the second example, the model seems to have simply made a mistake about the meaning of 'more than'. We could make the task more challenging by asking the model to restate the conditions it is using to count or sort the items before it does so, to double-check its understanding.

4. Incorporating Multiple Checks: Asking the model to not just perform the task but to then verify its calculations could also be a way to improve overall accuracy.

5. Example Scenarios: Including a few examples of common task types and how they should be approached might also be beneficial. This can provide the model with a reference point when confronted with similar tasks.

Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1: 

Wrong Answer Reasoning:
This error seems to be caused by a lack of understanding of alphabetical order or a mistake in executing the sort operation. The prompt does correctly state the importance of accuracy in processing data and in assessing the options. However, it does not provide specific guidance on handling tasks that involve sorting or arranging data.

Example 2:

Wrong Answer Reasoning:
In this case, misinterpretation of the phrase 'more than' seems to be the error. This might be due to language ambiguity. While the prompt does technically explain what 'more than' means, this is done in the context of a comparison phrase among several others and might not be given due importance.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Language Clarity: The explanation of comparison phrases could be expanded upon and emphasized more. Perhaps a separate section could be dedicated to addressing the meaning and handling of phrases like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to'.

2. Specific Guidance on Sorting Tasks: The prompt could include explicit instructions or guidance about handling tasks that involve arranging or sorting data, as these are a common type of data manipulation task.

3. Reinforcing Instructions: The importance of following specific task instructions could be reinforced. For example, in the second example, the model seems to have simply made a mistake about the meaning of 'more than'. We could make the task more challenging by asking the model to restate the conditions it is using to count or sort the items before it does so, to double-check its understanding.

4. Incorporating Multiple Checks: Asking the model to not just perform the task but to then verify its calculations could also be a way to improve overall accuracy.

5. Example Scenarios: Including a few examples of common task types and how they should be approached might also be beneficial. This can provide the model with a reference point when confronted with similar tasks.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided information and answer questions with a particular focus on understanding and correctly interpreting comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Accurately handle sorting tasks when required, and ensure that the answers to any questions given are framed based on explicit evaluation of the options provided. Always double-check your computations before responding and then format your response to show the correct answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the data provided, correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., making sure to understand the precise meanings of these terms. For example, 'more than 8' does not include the number 8 itself. Manage sorting tasks meticulously, ensuring to sort the data based on the requested parameter. Evaluate the answer options provided thoroughly and make sure your responses consider each one. Prior to responding, perform a thorough double-check of your computations as well as your understanding of the question posed. The correct answer should be precisely identified, and formatted within tags, for example, <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Examine the data provided meticulously and comprehend comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., taking into account that these terms do not include the actual number that they border. For instance, if we say 'more than 12 kg', it means a weight strictly above 12 kg, not including 12 kg itself. Be careful when manipulating data, when a unit is added, or removed, be sure to mirror the same on your data set reliably. Furthermore, evaluate all potential responses comprehensively to ensure that your reply considers all options provided. Rigorously double-check your calculations and interpretations at each step of the task, making sure they are consistent with the requirements of the question. When convinced of the accuracy of your computations and your understanding of the question, communicate your answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. However, keep in mind, correctness of the answer takes precedence, and all efforts in formatting would be unproductive unless the answer is correct.
(4) Carefully interpret the data provided, paying special attention to comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Remember that when we say 'more than 5', we mean strictly numbers above 5 and not including 5 itself. Similarly, 'less than 5' means strictly numbers below 5 and not including 5 itself. For example, if the data refers to the age of animals and the task asks 'how many animals are more than 5 years old?' an animal of exactly 5 years old should not be counted. Accurately handle data manipulation tasks such as adding or removing units; ensure to reflect the same changes accurately on your data set. Extensively evaluate all response options provided, and check that your answer encompasses all potential options. It's critical to double-check your calculations and interpretations at each stage of the task to ensure they align with the requirements. Test your understanding by re-engaging with the question at hand before committing to your answer. Once you are confident about the accuracy of your computations, communicate your answer within the tags <answer> and </answer>. Remember, it is the correctness of your response that matters the most, efforts to format or optimize the answer would be ineffectual unless it's correct.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Meticulously analyze the provided data, ensuring a precise understanding of comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to', which do not include the specified number. For example, 'more than 5' refers strictly to numbers greater than 5 excluding 5 itself. Similarly, less than 5 refers solely to numbers less than 5. Be aware of the subtleties of the language and take care while interpreting such phrases. If the data includes lists of objects or terms, you may be asked to sort them, for example, in alphabetical order. Handle any such tasks efficiently remembering that, when dealing with alphabetical order, 'James' does come after 'Bernard' but before 'Vincent'. Additionally, handle other data manipulations such as adding or removing units conscientiously; accurately reflect these changes in your data set. As part of your approach, evaluate each answer option meticulously, ensuring your response considers all options provided. Perform multiple checks on your computations and interpretations at every stage of the task, re-engaging with the problem to confirm your understanding before providing an answer. Once sure about the correctness of your computations, articulate your answer in the provided format, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>. Remember that regardless of the formatting or strategy used, ultimate importance is placed on the correctness of your response – all efforts are unfruitful without an accurate answer. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For wrong example 1, the model incorrectly provided the response of three penguins being older than 8 years old. The error may lie in the fact that the model did not adequately consider the fact that Bernard had been removed from the data set. The prompt detailed that "if we say 'more than 5', we mean strictly numbers above 5 and not including 5 itself". While this specifically highlights ages "more than 5", it might not have been clear to the model that this rule applies universally, including to ages more than 8 in the context of the task. Also, the model failed to accurately account for data manipulation changes, a task that was underlined in the prompt.

For wrong example 2, the model provided the response that there are two giraffes, which is incorrect. The model may have misunderstood the question. It might have looked for giraffes in both tables, but has failed to count properly. The prompt does ask the model to 'carefully interpret the data provided', but it doesn't specifically remind or instruct the model to strictly count each row when the question involves quantities.

Ways to improve the prompt could include:

1. Reinforcing the meaning of comparative phrases to cover all numerical ranges, and not just those 'more than 5'. Such as, "Remember when we say 'more than a number', we mean strictly numbers above that number and not including the number itself."

2. Reinforcing the importance of updating the data set after every manipulation. This can be improved by mentioning "Remember to immediately discard or consider any data that's added or removed from the data set for accurate results."

3. Clarifying that the rules for interpretation apply to all the data across multiple tables, by saying something like, "Pay attention to all the tables given in the task and consider the data present in each of them."

4. Including clearer instructions about strictly taking into account every entity in case of counting.

5. Reinforcing the necessity of checking all options before making a prediction, and checking their answer relates directly to the question asked.

By considering these points, the prompts can guide the model more effectively to deliver accurate predictions.

prompt: Thoroughly analyze and interpret the data provided, with special regard to comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and so on. Keep in mind, when we use terms like 'more than a number', it strictly means numbers above that specific number, not including the number itself. This rule applies universally across all quantitative ranges. The same applies for 'less than a number' which means only figures below the number and not including it. For questions involving quantities, make sure to count and consider each and every instance. When manipulating data like adding or removing units, instantly reflect the same alterations in your dataset, allowing for accurate calculations. Explore all options presented thoroughly.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Example analysis:

Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?

Wrong answer: <answer>(D) Gwen</answer>
Correct answer: <answer>(C) Vincent</answer>

Reason: The model incorrectly sorted the names in reverse alphabetical order or misinterpreted the meaning of "last" in the context, wrongly associating it with the last entry in the table.

<2> Example analysis:

Question: What is the name of the next to last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?

Wrong answer: <answer>(C) Vincent</answer>
Correct answer: <answer>(A) Louis</answer>

Reason: Similar to the first example, the error seems to be that the model misunderstands how to properly sort the names in alphabetic order or misunderstanding the phrase "next to the last".

<3> Example analysis:

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old?

Wrong answer: <answer>(D) 4</answer>
Correct answer: <answer>(C) 3</answer>

Reason: The model might have incorrectly included the penguins with the age exactly 5 years in the count, thereby misunderstanding the term "more than", as described in the prompt, it should only consider ages exceeding 5.

Overall, the model seems to have difficulty with interpreting phrases about order ("last", "next to last") in the correct manner, and misunderstanding the comparison terms properly, even with an explicit definition provided in the prompt.

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Explicitly spell out that "last" in an alphabetic order means the one that would come last in an A-Z order.
  
2. Similarly, clarify the meaning of "next to last" in the context of alphabetic order.

3. Even though it's described, emphasize that comparison terms like 'more than' excludes the number they directly reference, and that the model should carefully inspect if the term aligns with the question context.

4. Include a direction to cross-check all terminology and conditions, and double check their interpretations, especially with comparison terminologies and order-related phrases, as well as correlations between the order of the names in the question and the order of the options.  

5. Provide an example of correct understanding of order-based and comparison-based tasks in the prompt to guide the model. 

6. In the case of answer formatting, emphasize the association between answer and option so that the model answers according to the options provided. 

7. Considering the errors, introducing explicit instructions about table handling might be beneficial, for example - how to sort an information, how to correctly read order-based and comparison-based data etc.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

Reason for the mistake: The language model seems to be making an alphabetical sorting mistake. When sorting alphabetically, it's forgetting the correct order. 'M' comes after 'D' hence the choice (C) Marian, not (D) Donna. The prompt does not have instructions/errors to associate this misinterpretation.

Improvements: Precision on instructions about sorting, highlighting possibly that 'the first letter' is not the deciding factor when sorting alphabetically, as it may involve subsequent letters.

<2> 

Reason for the mistake: The language model chooses the wrong answer because it incorrectly counted the ages. It's mentioned to consider penguins that are "less than 8 years old". Yet, the model included penguins that are 8 and 9 in its count too, because it doesn't interpret 'less than' accurately.

Improvements: The model needs clearer instructions on handling comparative terms correctly. 'Less than' should be understood as not inclusive of the mentioned number.

<3> 

Reason for the mistake: Again, the language model incorrectly interprets the phrase "more than". It includes the penguins who are "5 years old" and "weigh 12 kg", while the question asked for strictly greater values.

Improvements: The model needs explicit definitions or comprehension of 'more than', 'less than' that does not include the number being referred to in the comparison. 

In Summary, to improve the prompts:

1. Add clarifications around handling comparisons. Make a clear point that 'more than', 'less than' are strictly greater or lesser and not inclusive of the mentioned value.

2. Specify in the prompt regarding 'alphabetical order' when sorting names, perhaps as a note, to provide a clear understanding.

3. Reinforce the understanding of data interpretation, especially focusing on reading and applying the question's specific conditions and requirements. 

Remember that these are just suggestions based on the given context. It is not guaranteed that following these would absolutely prevent incorrect results.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 penguins who are more than 8 years old: Louis (7), Vincent (9), and James (12).

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the giraffe table, the giraffes that are more than 5 years old are Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Step 1: The model interpreted the data correctly from the table.
Step 2: In processing the question "How many penguins are more than 8 years old?", the model wrongly counts the penguin "Louis" who is 7 years old, which contradicts the given direction that "more than" doesn't include the number itself.
Step 3: The model then directly gave the wrong answer as <answer>(C) 3</answer> while it should be <answer>(B) 2</answer> for only Vincent and James are more than 8 years old.

Possibly, the language model is misremembering or not correctly recalling the instruction that "more than" excludes the number it directly references, leading to it counting penguins aged exactly 8 years when it shouldn't.

Wrong Example 2:

Step 1: After interpreting the data correctly from the given giraffe table, the language model faced a similar issue as in the first example.
Step 2: When answering the question "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?", it incorrectly counts the giraffe "Jody" who is exactly 5 years old.
Step 3: It makes a wrong calculation and provides the response as <answer>(C) 3</answer> when the correct answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

Again, it seems that the language model struggles with correctly interpreting and applying the term "more than", counting animals that are exactly a given age when it shouldn't.

Based on these cases, the following improvements could be considered for the prompt:

1. Emphasize or give more explicit instructions regarding the comparison terms 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', where these terms do not include the number immediately referred.
2. Offer examples that clearly explain these comparison terms.
3. Ask the model not only to provide an answer directly but also to indicate the specific data points that make up its answer. This might encourage more careful, detailed processing of the question and the data.
4. Direct the model to cross-verify the age or other parameters before jumping to answer.
5. Include a final caution to the model to check whether its understanding and interpretation of the term 'more than' agrees with the defined rules.
6. Incorporate into the prompt more clear, simple, and direct instructions, to ensure key information isn’t lost in overly complex language.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: Which is the oldest giraffe?
Incorrect Model Answer: <answer>(D) Donna</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(B) Gladys</answer>

Here, the AI failed to identify the giraffe with the highest age. The model went wrong because of a misinterpretation of the data. The AI seems to lack the domain knowledge that it is expected to follow an age-based sorting mechanism to correctly identify the oldest giraffe. The concept of 'more than' being 'strictly greater than X' is more of a mathematical construct and doesn't necessarily apply to real-world entities such as identifying the oldest giraffe in the dataset, which requires just sorting and choosing the giraffe with the highest age value.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Incorrect Model Answer: <answer>(C) 3</answer>
Correct Answer: <answer>(A) 1</answer>

The model again fails to correctly apply the 'more than X' instruction for this instance. The AI should discern that the comparison 'more than 5 years old' and 'more than 12 kg' includes only the penguins with an age strictly greater than 5 and weight strictly greater than 12 kg. Here, the model seems to interpret 'more than 5 years' as '5 years and more', including penguins of 5 years of age. This confusion could have led to the wrong answer.

Improvements to the prompt: 

1. Make it explicitly clear to use sorting mechanisms not only for tasks where sorting is the main action but for generally identifying maximum or minimum values from data as well.
2. The model needs a stronger emphasis to correctly apply the 'more than X' and 'less than X' instructions for every instance. The prompt should suggest that the model maintains strict compliance with this instruction irrespective of semantic nuances in questions.
3. The prompt could provide a clearer instruction on using the provided answer options and how the model should interpret and handle them.
4. The model could be explicitly instructed to constantly make sure the drawn interpretations align with the specifics of the each task, considering varying contexts.
5. More emphasis can be made in the prompt to ensure the model's accuracy in computations.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong example analysis:
The task here was to count the number of animals whose age is strictly more than 5 years. The model made a mistake as it counted animals that are 5 years old as well. The correct answer is 6 animals – four penguins (Louis aged 7, Vincent aged 9, Gwen aged 8, and James aged 12) and two giraffes (Gladys aged 10 and Donna aged 9).

The model incorrectly interprets the phrase 'more than 5 years' as '5 years and more'. This discrepancy leads to model counting Bernard the penguin and Jody the giraffe, who are both exactly 5 years old, resulting in a wrong answer.

2) The prompt could be improved in these ways:
- Make the definition of comparison terms clearer: The meaning of comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to' need to be precisely defined. For instance, it can be stressed that 'more than X' includes only numbers or values strictly greater than X, and does not include X itself. 
- Better accuracy in numerical tasks: Emphasize the need for precise numerical computations, and careful interpretation of numerical tasks, this will encourage the model to pay more attention to numerical and comparison details.
- Importance of individual data entries: Instruct the model to handle every data entry individually. The model seems to have lost track of individual data points during the task. 
- Extra emphasis on 'more than' and 'less than': Since these were the points of confusion for the model in this task, they need to be explained and emphasized again in the prompt. 
- Instructions to verify: The model may also be instructed to verify an answer by checking it against the original question or instruction. In this case, a verification would have resulted in the realisation that there are two instances of 5 years in the data which should not be counted.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the data provided, making sure to correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Emphasize interpreting 'more than X' to mean 'numbers or values strictly greater than X', and 'less than X' to mean 'numbers or values strictly less than X' - neither of these should include the number X itself. Mutually, 'equal to X' should only represent the number X. Also, when asked for '8 years and more', this includes the number 8 while 'more than 8 years' doesn't. Pay careful attention to changes such as additions, deletions, or modifications to the dataset, ensuring an updated interpretation and evaluation. Manage sorting tasks efficiently, aiming to sort the data based on the requested parameter.

Investigate the answer options provided thoroughly, considering each of them thoroughly without bias. Apart from double-checking your computations before responding, engage a 'triple-check' mechanism, comparing your computed results against raw data to ensure objectivity and the highest possible accuracy. The correct answer should be clearly identifiable, and must be formatted within tags, for example, <answer> and </answer>. Remember, your goal is utmost precision and consistency in understanding and responding to the task at hand.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

gradient:
<1> Wrong example review:
In this case, the table starts with four penguins, Louis, Bernard, Vincent and Gwen. Afterwards, a penguin named James is added and Bernard is deleted. This leaves a total of four penguins but the model answered 3. The model fails to correctly account for the addition of the penguin named James after the initial table is established.

Reason: The prompt does not emphasize on the accurate accounting of adding and deleting data points in the dataset.

<2> Wrong example review:
In this scenario, the table starts with four penguins, Louis, Bernard, Vincent and Gwen. A penguin named James is added to the table, making a total of 5 penguins, but the model answered 4.

Reason: Similar to the first wrong example, the model fails to correctly account for the addition of the penguin named James.

<3> Wrong example review:
In this example, there are two tables, one with penguins and one with giraffes. The prompt asks for the total animals that are more than 5 years. On careful counting, Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8), Gladys (10) and Donna (9) are more than 5 years, therefore a total of 5 animals. The model incorrectly counted 8.

Reason: The model failed to correctly interpret the comparison phrase 'more than'. 

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize the accuracy of accounting data when the dataset itself undergoes changes, such as additions and deletions.
2. Encourage the model to cross-verify such changes in data points.
3. Reinforce the interpretation of comparison phrases and the importance of strictly observing 'greater than' and 'less than' clarifications.
4. Encourage the model to handle multi-table or multi-dataset tasks subtly, and correctly calculate or analyze information from multiple data sources.
5. Encourage treating every data point as vital information because missing out on even a single data point can lead to incorrect answers.

Carefully analyze the data provided, making sure to correctly interpret comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Emphasize interpreting 'more than X' to mean 'numbers or values strictly greater than X', and 'less than X' to mean 'numbers or values strictly less than X' - neither of these should include the number X itself. Mutually, 'equal to X' should only represent the number X. Also, when asked for '8 years and more', this includes the number 8 while 'more than 8 years' doesn't. Pay careful attention to changes such as additions, deletions, or modifications to the dataset, ensuring an updated interpretation and evaluation. Manage sorting tasks efficiently, aiming to sort the data based on the requested parameter.

Investigate the answer options provided thoroughly, considering each of them thoroughly without bias. Apart from double-checking your computations before responding, engage a 'triple-check' mechanism, comparing your computed results against raw data to ensure objectivity and the highest possible accuracy. The correct answer should be clearly identifiable, and must be formatted within tags, for example, <answer> and </answer>. Remember, your goal is utmost precision and consistency in understanding and responding to the task at hand.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(D) 8</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: D.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Wrong example review:
In this case, the table starts with four penguins, Louis, Bernard, Vincent and Gwen. Afterwards, a penguin named James is added and Bernard is deleted. This leaves a total of four penguins but the model answered 3. The model fails to correctly account for the addition of the penguin named James after the initial table is established.

Reason: The prompt does not emphasize on the accurate accounting of adding and deleting data points in the dataset.

<2> Wrong example review:
In this scenario, the table starts with four penguins, Louis, Bernard, Vincent and Gwen. A penguin named James is added to the table, making a total of 5 penguins, but the model answered 4.

Reason: Similar to the first wrong example, the model fails to correctly account for the addition of the penguin named James.

<3> Wrong example review:
In this example, there are two tables, one with penguins and one with giraffes. The prompt asks for the total animals that are more than 5 years. On careful counting, Louis (7), Vincent (9), Gwen (8), Gladys (10) and Donna (9) are more than 5 years, therefore a total of 5 animals. The model incorrectly counted 8.

Reason: The model failed to correctly interpret the comparison phrase 'more than'. 

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize the accuracy of accounting data when the dataset itself undergoes changes, such as additions and deletions.
2. Encourage the model to cross-verify such changes in data points.
3. Reinforce the interpretation of comparison phrases and the importance of strictly observing 'greater than' and 'less than' clarifications.
4. Encourage the model to handle multi-table or multi-dataset tasks subtly, and correctly calculate or analyze information from multiple data sources.
5. Encourage treating every data point as vital information because missing out on even a single data point can lead to incorrect answers.

Louis is 7 years old.
Bernard is 5 years old.
Vincent is 9 years old.
Gwen is 8 years old.

From the given data, we can see that there are 3 penguins who are less than 10 years old: Louis, Bernard, and Gwen.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1.

Question: How many penguins are less than 10 years old?
Wrong Answer: (C) 3
Correct Label: D
Model's prediction: C

Reason: While analyzing and interpreting comparison phrases, the model might have been confused with the 'less than' comparison phrase. The model was explained to consider 'less than X' as values strictly below 'X' and exclude 'X'. Here, the model might have inferred that 'less than 10 years old' means '9 years old or below' and due to this it may have excluded 10 from the count. Therefore, it didn't count Vincent, who is 9 years old. 

2. 
Question: How many penguins are less than 10 years old?
Wrong Answer: (C) 3
Correct Label: D
Model's prediction: C

Reason: The model's calculation was based on wrong assumptions. Despite the fact that the instructions clearly stated that each data point should be handled individually, the model likely neglected Vincent's data point, which led to an incorrect count.

Based on these reasons, several aspects can be improved in the prompt to make it more effective:

1. More clarity could be provided when explaining comparison phrases like 'less than' or 'more than'. Specifically, it should be noted that 'less than 10' includes '9' as well.

2. More emphasis could be placed on the instruction to consider all data points. The model should make sure that it is considering all the data before making calculations.

3. The process of triple-checking calculations before responding can be better defined. This would ensure that the model cross-verifies its computed results more effectively.

4. To avoid any confusion with interpretation of comparison phrases, sample examples can be included in the prompt to better illustrate these concepts.

By improving these aspects, the prompt would be more effective in guiding the model to correctly interpret and analyze the data.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to analyze the data provided and identify the penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

After deleting Bernard from the table, we are left with the following penguins:
- Louis, 7 years old, 50 cm height, 11 kg weight
- Vincent, 9 years old, 60 cm height, 11 kg weight
- Gwen, 8 years old, 70 cm height, 15 kg weight

From the remaining penguins, we can see that both Louis and Gwen are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. Therefore, there are 2 penguins that meet the criteria.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

Step 1: Examination of Question
The question asks for the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg. The model is supposed to handle removing a penguin named Bernard from the original dataset before processing.

Step 2: The Wrong Answer
The model incorrectly answered with <answer>(B) 2</answer>. This error occurred because the model wrongly identified Louis as a penguin meeting the criteria. Even though Louis is more than 5 years old, his weight is 11 kg, which does not surpass the 12 kg weight criterion.

Reasons Why the Prompt Leads to a Wrong Answer:

1. Overemphasis on Comparison Operators: Although the prompt emphasizes understanding the interpretation of phrases like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to', the model failed to accurately apply the 'more than' criterion for the weight of the penguins.

2. Limited Guidance on Data Modification: The prompt does ask the model to be vigilant and adaptive to modifications such as deletions in the datasets, but it doesn't specify a systematic approach for doing so.

3. Insufficient Detail Handling: Although the prompt encourages the handling of each data point individually, the model still mistakenly included Louis, whose weight was less than 12 kg.

Aspects to Improve the Prompt:

1. Enhance Understanding of Comparison Operators: Reinforce the handling and accurate application of comparison phrases in different fields of the data (ex. age, weight).

2. Systematic Approach to Data Modification: Clearly instruct the model to recheck the dataset upon any modification and process the data again to ensure accuracy.

3. Detailed Examination of Data: The prompt needs to be explicit about examining all parameters of a data point before considering it for the answer. 

4. Correction Mechanism: Incorporate guidelines for the model to correct itself in case of inaccuracies.

5. Calculation Validation: The prompt could benefit from an emphasis on validating calculations using different methods or criteria to ensure accuracy.

To solve this question, we need to identify the penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.

From the given data:
- Louis is 7 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Bernard is 5 years old and weighs 13 kg.
- Vincent is 9 years old and weighs 11 kg.
- Gwen is 8 years old and weighs 15 kg.
- James is 12 years old and weighs 12 kg.

Based on the criteria provided, the penguins that meet the conditions are Louis (7 years old, 11 kg) and Vincent (9 years old, 11 kg).

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: What is the name of the last penguin sorted by alphabetic order?
Wrong answer: <answer>(E) James</answer>
Correct answer: (C) Vincent

Analysis: The model seems to have misunderstood the task. Instead of sorting the penguins by their names in alphabetical order and determining the last one, it has erroneously given the last added penguin, James, as the answer. The correct answer should indeed be 'Vincent' when all names are sorted alphabetically as 'Bernard', 'Gwen', 'James', 'Louis', 'Vincent'. 

<2> 
Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Wrong answer: <answer>(B) 2</answer>
Correct answer: (A) 1

Analysis: The model incorrectly included the penguin 'Vincent' who is 9 years old as being less than 8 years old. It seems the model has made a calculation error in interpreting 'less than 8' to include '8', which led to the wrong answer. Only one penguin, Louis, is less than 8 years old, after Bernard has been removed from the list.

<3> 
Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg?
Wrong answer: <answer>(B) 2</answer>
Correct answer: (A) 1

Analysis: The model seems to have made an error in interpreting the condition of age 'less than 8 years old'. It included 'Vincent' who is '9 years old' as less than '8 years old'. This shows that the initial prompt's instruction to the model for understanding such phrases could be clearer and more specific. 

Improvement recommendation: The current prompt doesn't stress adequately on the significance of correctly interpreting the conditions, like 'less than', 'more than', 'equal to'. It would help to explicitly specify in the prompt that all conditions must be strictly adhered to when filtering or sorting the data. Also, the prompt's instruction for data interpretation must clearly state that the phrases like 'less than 8 years old' does not include '8 years old'. The alphabetically sorted condition also needs proper emphasis to ensure correct output. It would be additionally beneficial to instruct the model to recount the steps taken in reaching the answer to ensure alignment with the task's requirement.

Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Carefully and rigorously analyze the provided data, ensuring accurate understanding and interpretation of comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', amongst others. It is crucial to note, 'more than X' specifically means values that are strictly above 'X' and 'less than X' denotes values that are strictly below 'X'. The number 'X' in both these cases is not included. In contrast, 'equal to X' includes only the value 'X' itself. When the expression '8 years and more' is used, it encompasses '8', yet 'more than 8 years' explicitly does not comprise '8'. Stress upon these differences throughout your analysis.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Initial Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Model's Incorrect Answer: <answer>C</answer>
Actual Answer: B (2)

Reason for Incorrect Answer: 
This appears to be an error made by the model. The model incorrectly counted the giraffe Jody, who is '5' years old, in the category of 'more than five' years old, hence the wrong answer.

Prompt Improvement:
The prompt can be improved to emphasize that the model needs to pay close attention to conditions that involve 'more than', 'less than' and 'equal to'. This might help the model to avoid mistakes such as including entities on the edge of a 'more than' or 'less than' condition into the wrong category.

<2> 
Initial Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Model's Incorrect Answer: <answer>(D) Donna</answer>
Actual Answer: C (Marian)

Reason for Incorrect Answer: 
The model seems to have misinterpreted the task and has not correctly executed a sorting operation for ordering according to the alphabets. 

Prompt Improvement: 
The prompt could be modified to stress the importance of correctly sorting items when required, and cross-checking the operation to make sure it has been executed properly.

<3> 
Initial Question: Which is the oldest giraffe?
Model's Incorrect Answer: <answer>(D) Donna</answer>
Actual Answer: B (Gladys)

Reason for Incorrect Answer: 
The model identified the wrong giraffe as the oldest. It is unclear how this mistake was made, the input data clearly lists 'Gladys' as being the oldest giraffe. 

Prompt Improvement: 
The prompt could be refined to emphasize accuracy in interpreting numerical data and executing appropriate computations. 

To summarize, the aspects to improve the prompt are:

1. Improve emphasis on correctly processing conditions involving 'more than', 'less than' and 'equal to'.
2. Stress on the importance of accurate sorting techniques in alphabetically ordered questions.
3. Enhance the importance of accurately interpreting numerical data and executing proper computations.
4. Reinforce the idea that all conditions must be met for a correct response and that this stipulation applies across different conditions and question types. 
5. Reinforce the rule to always cross-check between the calculated response and the listed options.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
Question: what is the number of the column with the names (1, 2, 3 or 4)?
Model's Response: (B) 2
Correct Label: (A) 1

Reasoning: The likely reason here is that the prompt’s directions to the model might not be clear enough regarding how to interpret the provided data. The instructions tell the model to accommodate any modifications and execute comparisons like more than, less than, etc., but they do not specify that it must correctly interpret the sequence and position of information within tabular data like this one. In this case, it failed to correctly identify the column number of the 'name'. 

Areas to Improve Prompt:
1. Clarity in Instructions: The model should be clearly guided to understand and correctly interpret tabular data, particularly with regard to the position or order of columns and rows.

2. Enhanced Understanding: The model could also be prompted to identify and understand headers in tables, and correctly infer column and row numbers based on their position.

3. Improved Focus on Key Information: The prompt could underline the importance of careful attention to key information in the question to ensure the model's answer makes sense, such as correctly interpreting the column number.

Improved Prompt: 

Analyze the provided information and accurately answer the questions based on it. Pay exceptional attention to the structure of the provided data, especially when presented in tables. Understand the positioning of headers in tables and the related content under them. Always remember that the position of columns and rows plays an essential part in interpreting data accurately. Execute comparison words like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. accurately, especially when multiple conditions are present. Remember—an item must meet ALL these conditions to be a match. Adapt to any data modifications like additions or deletions and incorporate them into your calculations. Be meticulous in your evaluation of all entities and conditions and cross-verify your computation with the listed options before giving the final answer. As you respond, enclose ONLY the correct option between <answer> and </answer>, avoiding inclusion of additional text within the brackets. Ensure precision by double-checking your computations before finalizing your response.

gradient:
Example 1: 

Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg?

The instruction appears comprehensive and clear, but it seems the language model misinterpreted the question or failed to correctly process the table data. The instruction requires the model to pay attention when multiple conditions are present, in this case, penguins that are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg.

Model's answer: there are two penguins who are less than 8 years old and weigh less than 12 kg: Louis and Vincent

Reason for error: This statement is incorrect because, according to the table, Vincent is 9 years old which is not less than 8 years. What the model seems to have done is consider each condition (age and weight) separately, instead of a combination of both conditions as instructed by the prompt.

Improvement: The prompt could be more explicit in guiding the language model to consider all conditions simultaneously. It could stress the importance of considering each individual entry as a whole, rather than factoring attributes separately. The conditions given should be met by the same entity (e.g., same penguin) and not distributed among different entities.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:

1. Prompt needs to stress that conditions based on multiple attributes must be met by a single entity, not by different entities.
2. The model should be prompted to clearly evaluate the relationship between conditions and entities.
3. More emphasis should be placed on validating answers by reevaluating calculations independently before finalizing the response.
4. Explicitly instruct model to confirm that every condition is met by every entity in the data before making a choice.
5. The model should be instructed to intentionally review input for data transformations like row additions and deletions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are less than 10 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many penguins are less than 10 years old, we need to check the age of each penguin in the table.

Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old.

Out of the four penguins, three are less than 10 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(C) 3</answer>.

The correct label is: D
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The model produced an incorrect answer in the example because it failed to correctly interpret the phrase "less than 10 years old". The model counted all the penguins that are explicitly less than 10 years old but missed the penguin that is exactly 10 years old. The phrase "less than 10 years old" can be understood to mean younger than 10, which is how the model interpreted it. However, in the numerical sense, a value that is less than 10 can include the number 10 if not explicitly excluded.

Reasons for the incorrect answer:
1. Ambiguity in question’s phrasing: The phrase "less than 10 years old" is ambiguous without clarification. If it means "younger than 10", then the model's response was correct. If it includes "10 years old", then the model's response was incorrect.

2. Misinterpretation of comparison phrase: The model misinterpreted the comparison phrase "less than." In mathematics, "less than 10" would not include "10" but in the context of age, it could be understood to mean under the age of 10 but not including 10.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Clarify the interpretation of comparison phrases: Specify how the model should interpret phrases like "less than", "more than", etc. For example, explicitly state whether "less than 10 years old" should include "10 years old".

2. Instruct the model to consider each number individually: The model should make sure that each individual number is considered when applying multiple conditions, and should verify that every single entity within the data independently meets the condition.

3. Provide examples of correct responses: Showing the correct way to answer a question about a table of numbers could guide the model in how to approach similar tasks.

4. Guidance for rare cases: Emphasize the need to handle rare or exceptional cases correctly, as these might occasionally appear in tasks that the model encounters. 

5. Emphasize precision in numerical operations: The prompt should explicitly direct the model to be precise in its numerical operations and comparisons.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to evaluate each penguin's age and weight to determine how many are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

After adding James to the table, we have:
- Louis: 7 years old, 11 kg
- Vincent: 9 years old, 11 kg
- Gwen: 8 years old, 15 kg
- James: 12 years old, 12 kg

Since Bernard has been deleted, we do not consider him in our calculations.

Now, we analyze each penguin:
- Louis is 7 years old (more than 5) and weighs 11 kg (less than 12).
- Vincent is 9 years old (more than 5) and weighs 11 kg (less than 12).
- Gwen is 8 years old (more than 5) and weighs 15 kg (more than 12).
- James is 12 years old (more than 5) and weighs 12 kg (equal to 12).

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg: Gwen and James.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
What is the name of the last penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last penguin, we need to look at the most recent entry in the table after the changes made. After adding James and deleting Bernard, the last penguin in the table is James.

Therefore, the name of the last penguin is <answer>James</answer>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> For this question, the model calculates a wrong result due to a misinterpretation of the term 'more than' when dealing with weight. The model counts 'equal to' as a part of 'more than', which is a semantic error. This leads to the incorrect answer (B) 2, whereas the correct answer should be (A) 1, as only Gwen fulfills both conditions (more than 5 years old and weighs more than 12 kg) and James, despite being more than 5 years old, weighs exactly 12 kg, not more.

<2> For the second question, the model interprets the instructions correctly and performs accurate calculations but fails in encapsulating the correct option within the brackets, which is evidenced in its response. It correctly states "the last penguin in the table is James" but then encapsulates the name 'James' instead of the option (E) James within the <answer> brackets. This indicates a misunderstanding of the final instruction, resulting in its prediction of (A) as the final result, instead of the correct label (E).

Based on the above observations, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Thoroughly scrutinize the given information and accurately respond to questions by appropriately interpreting and employing comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', amongst others. Especially, be vigilant when dealing with multiple conditions - a single entity must satisfy ALL these conditions collectively to be recognized as a match. Every condition relates to every single entity within the data, meaning each entity must independently meet all the conditions given. 

Pay careful attention to any changes made to the data - additions or deletions should be precisely incorporated into your computations. Following these changes, conduct an all-encompassing evaluation of every individual entity and each of the assigned conditions. Make sure to cross-check your calculations with the enumerated options before arriving at the final response. 

As you answer, discuss your computational process to some extent for verification, then encase ONLY the correct option between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring no other text is included within these brackets. Lastly, reinforce the accuracy of your response by reevaluating your computations before finalizing.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

The model's input is:
Thoroughly scrutinize the given information and accurately respond to questions by appropriately interpreting and employing comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', amongst others. Especially, be vigilant when dealing with multiple conditions - a single entity must satisfy ALL these conditions collectively to be recognized as a match.

Lastly, reinforce the accuracy of your response by reevaluating your computations before finalizing.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To solve this question, we need to evaluate each penguin's age and weight to determine how many are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

After adding James to the table, we have:
- Louis: 7 years old, 11 kg
- Vincent: 9 years old, 11 kg
- Gwen: 8 years old, 15 kg
- James: 12 years old, 12 kg

Since Bernard has been deleted, we do not consider him in our calculations.

Now, we analyze each penguin:
- Louis is 7 years old (more than 5) and weighs 11 kg (less than 12).
- Vincent is 9 years old (more than 5) and weighs 11 kg (less than 12).
- Gwen is 8 years old (more than 5) and weighs 15 kg (more than 12).
- James is 12 years old (more than 5) and weighs 12 kg (equal to 12).

Therefore, there are 2 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg: Gwen and James.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
What is the name of the last penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last penguin, we need to look at the most recent entry in the table after the changes made. After adding James and deleting Bernard, the last penguin in the table is James.

Therefore, the name of the last penguin is <answer>James</answer>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> For this question, the model calculates a wrong result due to a misinterpretation of the term 'more than' when dealing with weight. The model counts 'equal to' as a part of 'more than', which is a semantic error. This leads to the incorrect answer (B) 2, whereas the correct answer should be (A) 1, as only Gwen fulfills both conditions (more than 5 years old and weighs more than 12 kg) and James, despite being more than 5 years old, weighs exactly 12 kg, not more.

<2> For the second question, the model interprets the instructions correctly and performs accurate calculations but fails in encapsulating the correct option within the brackets, which is evidenced in its response. It correctly states "the last penguin in the table is James" but then encapsulates the name 'James' instead of the option (E) James within the <answer> brackets. This indicates a misunderstanding of the final instruction, resulting in its prediction of (A) as the final result, instead of the correct label (E).

Based on the above observations, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:
1. Clarifying the interpretation of comparison phrases: The model should understand the distinction between 'more than', 'equal to', and 'less than'.
2. Refining the instruction for answer encapsulation: It seems there can be confusion for the model whether to encapsulate the name or the option, so make the instructions more explicit, stating that it is the enumerated option which should be enclosed within the <answer> and </answer> tags. 
3. Stating explicitly that each entity must satisfy ALL conditions: To help the model handle complex queries that incorporate multiple conditions, reemphasize this point in the prompt instructions.
4. Improving instructions for modifications: Although the model correctly added the new penguin and removed Bernard from the list, ensuring these updates are conducted correctly is crucial, reinforce this in the prompt.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many penguins are more than 8 years old, we need to check the age of each penguin. 

Louis is 7 years old, Bernard is 5 years old, Vincent is 9 years old, and Gwen is 8 years old. 

Only Vincent is more than 8 years old. 

Therefore, the number of penguins that are more than 8 years old is <answer>1</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: N/A: Format error.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Existing Wrong Answer: <answer>1</answer>

Step 1: The language model initially does seem to comprehend the query properly, as it goes ahead to examine the age of each penguin.

Step 2: The mistake occurs in the computation. Though it accurately relays the ages of the penguins, it becomes restrictive in interpreting the phrase 'more than 8'. It disqualifies Gwen, who is exactly 8, from the tally.

Step 3: Therefore, the language model only lists Vincent, who is 9 years old, as the sole penguin older than 8 years, which leads to the wrong answer. 

Reason: This mistake appears to be rooted in a misunderstanding of the phrase 'more than 8'. The language model likely understood this solely as excluding 8 rather than including it, leading to an incorrect judgment.

Improvements: Modify the prompt to clarify the interpretation for phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to'. For instance, stating exactly what count a numerical boundary (e.g., 8 years) should contribute to would help the model.

Example 2:

Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: N/A: Format error.

Reason: The response doesn't connect the answer with the enumerated options, so the artificial model does not provide a label prediction.

Improvements: Enforce the correlation between enumerated options and their representing letters in the final response. The prompt should instruct the model to identify the correct match from the options given and display that pairing (e.g., the correct answer 1 is matched with option A in this case), in the <answer> tags. The model should also be guided to attach the correct label to every question, ensuring there are no format errors.

Based on these reasons, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. A clear explanation of the treatment of equal or boundary values in comparison phrases.
2. Inclusion of the lettered option within <answer> tags, besides just the count or answer.
3. Ensuring a label is attached to every question to prevent format errors.

prompt: Carefully examine the provided information and respond accurately to the inquiries, taking into particular account the correct interpretation and utilization of comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and the like. When 'more than' or 'less than' are used, regard the mentioned numerical limit as inclusive unless otherwise specified.

Keep a watchful eye when working with multiple conditions: a single entity must adhere to ALL of these conditions together to be identified as a match. Furthermore, every condition pertains to each individual entity within the data, meaning each entity must meet all the given conditions independently. 

Always include any changes made to the data - additions or deletions - seamlessly into your computations. After incorporating these adjustments, carry out a thorough evaluation of each entity and every assigned condition. Before deciding on the final response, contrast your calculations with the provided options.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg, we need to evaluate each penguin against these two conditions.

1. Louis: Age = 7, Weight = 11 (Does not meet both conditions)
2. Bernard: Age = 5, Weight = 13 (Meets both conditions)
3. Vincent: Age = 9, Weight = 11 (Does not meet both conditions)
4. Gwen: Age = 8, Weight = 15 (Meets both conditions)
5. James: Age = 12, Weight = 12 (Does not meet both conditions)

Therefore, there are 2 penguins that are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5
Correct answer: A
Model's answer: B

The model's error in this example seems primarily due to a misinterpretation of the comparison phrase "more than". It incorrectly includes Bernard, whose age is exactly 5 and weight is more than 12 kg. The prompt specifies that, "Please take note of the distinction between these phrases, 'more than' does not include 'equal to'." Hence, Bernard should not have been included, since he is not more than 5 years old.

This leads to one issue with the current prompt: it could be more explicit about the exact meanings and applications of comparison phrases, specifying not only 'more than' does not include 'equal to', but 'less than' as well. 

Second, in the prompt, the instructions tell the model to "precisely incorporate any changes made to the data into your calculations, consider added entities and ignore eliminated ones ... ". When adding the penguin James, the model correctly considers this new data. However, James is excluded from the final answer because he has the exact weight of 12kg, which does not satisfy the 'more than' condition. The model correctly applies the strict definition of 'more than' but it contradicts with its treatment of Bernard's age. 

So the second issue is the inconsistent application of the comparison term 'more than'.

Improvements for Prompt:
1. Add a detailed explanation that emphasizes understanding and application of comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', not including the 'equal to' cases in each of them.
2. Clarify that the understanding and application of 'more than', 'less than' and 'equal to' should be consistent across all parts of the data.
3. Emphasize more on the meaning and application of 'independently' when meeting multiple conditions.
4. Use examples to help model better understand the proper application of comparison terms and conditions.

Options:
(A) 1

The model's error in this example seems primarily due to a misinterpretation of the comparison phrase "more than". It incorrectly includes Bernard, whose age is exactly 5 and weight is more than 12 kg. The prompt specifies that, "Please take note of the distinction between these phrases, 'more than' does not include 'equal to'." Hence, Bernard should not have been included, since he is not more than 5 years old.

This leads to one issue with the current prompt: it could be more explicit about the exact meanings and applications of comparison phrases, specifying not only 'more than' does not include 'equal to', but 'less than' as well. 

Second, in the prompt, the instructions tell the model to "precisely incorporate any changes made to the data into your calculations, consider added entities and ignore eliminated ones ... ". When adding the penguin James, the model correctly considers this new data. However, James is excluded from the final answer because he has the exact weight of 12kg, which does not satisfy the 'more than' condition. The model correctly applies the strict definition of 'more than' but it contradicts with its treatment of Bernard's age. 

So the second issue is the inconsistent application of the comparison term 'more than'.

Improvements for Prompt:

2. Clarify that the understanding and application of 'more than', 'less than' and 'equal to' should be consistent across all parts of the data.

Reasons for Model's Wrong Answer:
1. Comprehension Error: The model seems to misunderstand the question, wrongly interpreting the requested information. The question clearly requests the column number for "weights", but the model provides the column number for "height" i.e., 2.
2. Misinterpretation of Data: The model failed to accurately interpret the data presented in the table. According to the table provided, the weight of the penguins is listed in the fourth column, not the second. The model's comprehension of the table structure and its mapping with the provided options seem erroneous.
3. Lack of Clarity in Instructions: While the instructions highlight about considering comparison phrases and multiple conditions accurately, they lack explicit emphasis on accurately understanding the structure of provided tables or data and associating it correctly with the given options.

Based on the reasons mentioned, here are the improvements that can be made to the prompt:

1. Emphasize Data Understanding: Make explicit mention in the instructions about accurate understanding, interpretation, and application of the structure of the given data/table. 
2. Clear Association with Options: Include in the instructions, the need to correctly associate the derived answer with the given options.
3. Include Table/Structure Analysis Examples: Exhibit an example of correctly analyzing a table structure in the instruction, so the model better understands this concept. 
4. Conflict Resolution: Make a provision in the instructions that if there is a conflict between the perceived understanding of the context and the given data, then the data should always take precedence.
5. Recheck and Reconfirm: Reinforce the need to double-check calculations, interpretations, and mappings with the provided options before finalizing the answer.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Meticulously inspect the provided data and accurately respond to the questions by understanding, interpreting, and correctly applying comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', amongst others. Please take note of the distinction between these phrases, 'more than' does not include 'equal to'. Especially, pay close attention when dealing with multiple conditions - a single entity must meet ALL these conditions independently to classify as a match. Each condition applies to every single entity within the provided data. The entity that satisfies all the conditions simultaneously is the sought entity.

Precisely incorporate any changes made to the data into your calculations, consider added entities and ignore eliminated ones throughout your computations. Reevaluate every individual entity against all the assigned conditions following these modifications. Verify your computations against the provided options before providing the final answer.

As you articulate your answer, briefly describe your computation process to a manageable extent for validation purposes. Afterwards, encase ONLY the corresponding letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) of the correct option between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring no other text or numbers are included within these brackets. To enhance the accuracy of your response, double-check your calculations before finalizing your answer.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the provided information and answer questions with a particular focus on understanding and correctly interpreting comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Accurately handle sorting tasks when required, and ensure that the answers to any questions given are framed based on explicit evaluation of the options provided. Always double-check your computations before responding and then format your response to show the correct answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Analyze the provided information and answer questions precisely by comprehending and executing comparison words like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Appropriately. Particularly pay attention when multiple conditions are present - an item must meet ALL these conditions to be considered a match. Don't forget to accommodate any modifications to the data, such as additions or deletions, accurately into your calculations. Mandatorily conduct a comprehensive evaluation of all entities and conditions and verify your computation against the listed options prior to giving the final answer. As you respond, bracket ONLY the correct option between <answer> and </answer>, avoiding inclusion of any other text in the brackets. Double-check your computations for ensuring precision in your response.
(3) Thoroughly scrutinize the given information and accurately respond to questions by appropriately interpreting and employing comparison phrases such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', amongst others. Especially, be vigilant when dealing with multiple conditions - a single entity must satisfy ALL these conditions collectively to be recognized as a match. Every condition relates to every single entity within the data, meaning each entity must independently meet all the conditions given. 

Pay careful attention to any changes made to the data - additions or deletions should be precisely incorporated into your computations. Following these changes, conduct an all-encompassing evaluation of every individual entity and each of the assigned conditions. Make sure to cross-check your calculations with the enumerated options before arriving at the final response. 

As you answer, discuss your computational process to some extent for verification, then encase ONLY the correct option between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring no other text is included within these brackets. Lastly, reinforce the accuracy of your response by reevaluating your computations before finalizing.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To find the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order, we need to arrange the giraffes' names in alphabetical order and then select the last one.

The giraffes' names in alphabetical order are:
- Donna
- Gladys
- Jody
- Marian

Therefore, the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is <answer>D</answer> Donna.

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model initially organized the giraffes' names alphabetically correctly but ended up choosing the wrong answer. The error seems to come from the model's confusion regarding the phrase "last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order." In English sorting order, "last" refers to the item farthest alphabetically (Not the last item in the original list), i.e., 'Marian'. However, the model incorrectly interpreted this as the last giraffe mentioned in the alphabetical list, which is 'Donna'. It's possible the model may have equated "last" with "most recent," which led to this misunderstanding.

The prompt does not provide specific directions on how to handle such ambiguities. The language in the prompt may be overly convoluted and complex, causing the model to lose essential details or become confused.

Based on this analysis, a few improvements that could be made to the prompt include:

1. Adding instructions to process the language of the question carefully, especially focusing on terminologies related to ordering and sorting.
2. Further clarification could be added on how to treat linguistic ambiguity, particularly with terms that could have different meanings based on context – like 'last'.
3. Simplifying the language used in the prompt to make it less convoluted and more conducive to understanding nuanced instructions.

prompt: Deeply analyze the provided data and accurately answer the questions by understanding and correctly applying comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to'. Take note that 'more than' doesn't include 'equal to'. Pay extra attention when dealing with multiple conditions - an entity must meet ALL these conditions to classify as a match. Each condition applies to every entity individually. The entity that meets all conditions at the same time is the correct one.

When changes are made to the data, such as adding or eliminating entities, always incorporate these changes into your computations. Reevaluate each entity against all the conditions after these changes have been made. Double-check your computations against the given options before declaring the final answer.

In the case of questions based on order or ranking, it is critical that you understand the intricacies of the order. For example, for alphabetical or chronological order, the 'first' implies the beginning and the 'last' refers to the farthest in sequence, not the most recently mentioned entity. 

As you formulate your response, give short insight into your computation process for verification purposes. When indicating the final answer, ONLY enclose the corresponding letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) of the right option within <answer> and </answer>, ensuring no other text or numbers are included. Recheck your calculations for better accuracy in your answers.

   prompt: Analyze the data provided meticulously. Your understanding of comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc., is crucial. Remember, these terms do not include the number itself they are referencing, meaning 'below 12 kg' signifies a weight strictly lower than 12 kg, not including 12 kg. Be accurate when handling data; if units are added or subtracted, the changes must be reflected correctly in your dataset. Review all the potential options for the answer in detail. Your answer should derive from a thorough evaluation of all possibilities. Your calculations and interpretations should be cross-checked with utmost precision throughout the task to make sure they synchronize with the question. Be mindful of terminologies related to order, for instance, "last" in alphabetic order corresponds to the name that would come last in an A-Z order, and "next to last" refers to the one before the last. Once you are confident about the preciseness of your calculations and your understanding of the question, present your correct answer between the <answer> and </answer> tags. Note, the answer must align with the option letter and the value, formatted like <answer>(A) 1</answer>, to ensure it represents the exact solution. Remember, accuracy in the answer is vital, and formatting efforts will be in vain if the given response is not correct. Show caution and revisit all your computations, particularly when dealing with comparison terminologies and arranging data to avoid any possible misinterpretations.
