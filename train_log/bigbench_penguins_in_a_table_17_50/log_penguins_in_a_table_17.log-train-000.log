gradient:
<1> 

Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Wrong Answer: (C) 3
Correct Answer: (B) 2
Reason: The prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" does not provide clear instruction to the language model that it is required to count the number of giraffes more than 5 years old. Instead, the model could have misunderstood the task to attribute causality within the presented data. The misinterpretation of the task led to the wrong answer, which ignored Jody as her age is exactly 5, not more than 5. 

<2> 

Question: How many penguins are less than 8 years old?
Wrong Answer: (B) 2
Correct Answer: (A) 1
Reason: The prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" does not guide the language model appropriately to follow the changes made to the data, especially the deletion of Bernard. As a result, the model incorrectly counted Bernard as a penguin less than 8 years old. Without clear instructions, the model failed to track the update correctly. 

Improvements:

1. Specify the Task Clearly: The prompt can be made more specific to underline that the task is to count, track changes made to data, and respond to data-centric questions rather than output causal attributions. 

2. Include Instruction to Updates and Changes: The prompt could include instructions to be aware of all the data modifications, such as insertions or deletions from the data set before answering.

3. Define Categorization: The definition of categories in questions like "more than 5 years old" and "less than 8 years old" needs to be clear. The prompt could instruct the model to not include the boundary values in these categories. 

With these in mind, an improved prompt could be "Analyze the given data set, track all changes, and answer questions based on the final state of the data, considering the specific definition of the categories in the question."

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example:
In this example, the model correctly processes the comparison but makes the wrong conclusion. It counts the penguin Vincent who weighs 11 kg as weighing more than 12 kg. The error is not related to the prompt as the task relates to data analysis rather than causal attribution. 

<2> Wrong Example:
Here, the model again performs the correct process of comparing age but makes a mistake in counting. The giraffe, Jody, is exactly 5 years old and should not have been counted as "more than 5 years old". Again, this error is not related to the task of causal attribution defined in the prompt. 

<3> Wrong Example:
The model did not arrange the giraffe names in alphabetic order. If it had, it would have identified Marian as the last giraffe. This error lies in the model's understanding and processing of the data, not in the prompt. The task does not involve causal attribution.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:
1. Misinterpretation of comparison like "more than".
2. Incorrect data processing and analytical skills.
3. The tasks provided in the examples do not align with the prompt of causal attribution.

To Improve the Prompt:
1. Specify the type of questions regarding causal attribution to align with the prompt better. For instance, asking about the cause-effect relationship.
2. Include instructions regarding comparison operations and sorting operations. 
3. To reduce the complexity of the tasks, consider breaking down more extensive examples into smaller, manageable parts.
4. Make sure the training data includes varied examples that explore more boundaries of the definition and understanding of "causal attribution".

gradient:
For each question:

<1> 
The prompt didn't specify that Bernard had been deleted from the table before the question was asked. Therefore, the model didn't account for Bernard's absence when counting the penguins older than 8 years, leading to an incorrect prediction. 

<2> 
This case is similar to the previous one, and it seems the model has difficulties with understanding or handling exceptions or specific conditions in the dataset. As there's no operation performed on the table before the question, we could only assume that the model didn't interpret "more than 5 years old" correctly and instead counted all the penguins.

<3> 
In this case, the model failed to understand the question is referring to both the penguins' and giraffes' tables. It seemed to consider only a single table (most likely the latter), thus overestimating the number of animals over 5 years old.

Based on the insights from these examples, here is a list of aspects that can help to improve the prompt:

1. The prompt should explicitly specify any changes made to the data set before the questions are asked. For instance, if an item is removed from the table, this needs to be clearly stated in the prompt.
   
2. The prompt should provide clear directions on which data to consider for each question. If a question refers to multiple data sets, this should be unambiguously stated in the prompt.
   
3. The prompt could emphasize key parts of the question, such as age limits or specific conditions. This could improve the model’s comprehension of the question and lead to correct answers.
   
4. The prompt could guide the language model to verify its answer before providing the final response. This step could help the model spot any mistakes in its initial response.
   
5. General improvements to the model's understanding and handling of numerical data and comparative conditions could greatly enhance its performance on such tasks. 

Remember, improving a prompt often involves iterative testing and tweaking to achieve optimal performance.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For each question:

<1> 
The prompt didn't specify that Bernard had been deleted from the table before the question was asked. Therefore, the model didn't account for Bernard's absence when counting the penguins older than 8 years, leading to an incorrect prediction. 

<2> 
This case is similar to the previous one, and it seems the model has difficulties with understanding or handling exceptions or specific conditions in the dataset. As there's no operation performed on the table before the question, we could only assume that the model didn't interpret "more than 5 years old" correctly and instead counted all the penguins.

<3> 
In this case, the model failed to understand the question is referring to both the penguins' and giraffes' tables. It seemed to consider only a single table (most likely the latter), thus overestimating the number of animals over 5 years old.

Based on the insights from these examples, here is a list of aspects that can help to improve the prompt:

1. The prompt should explicitly specify any changes made to the data set before the questions are asked. For instance, if an item is removed from the table, this needs to be clearly stated in the prompt.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> The model doesn't acknowledge the requirement to track all modifications to the data set. Specifically, it has not taken into account that Bernard was deleted. Thus, while considering penguins that are less than 8 years old, it included Vincent who is indeed more than 8 years old. A clear instruction about careful tracking of all changes seems missing in the prompt which should be revised.

<2> The model incorrectly interprets the number of penguins in the table. It counts the original four penguins but ignores James, who was added later. This suggests that the model may not be thoroughly evaluating updates to the data set, suggesting a problem with the prompt's instruction about tracking modifications and confirming them before calculating/answering.

<3> Similar to example 1, while computing the number of penguins more than 8 years old, the model included Gwen, 8 years old, which is incorrect as she does not fit within the specified category. This points to an insufficiency in the prompt's instruction to carefully interpret categories specified in the question.

Based on these examples, the following aspects can improve the prompt:

1. Explicit emphasis on careful tracking of all modifications to the data set - both additions and deletions.
2. Instruction to verify data modifications before the model proceeds to answer the questions.
3. More emphasis on correct and precise interpretation of categories in the questions (like "more than 8 years old" and "less than 8 years old").
4. Encourage the model to double-check all calculations and computations using the updated data before finalizing the answer.

Example 1:

Issue: The language model has incorrectly analyzed the age of the giraffes in the second table. When asked "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?", the language model has included Jody, who is 5 years old exactly. As per the question, only giraffes more than 5 years old should have been counted.

Reason: The prompt is not necessarily flawed, but the language model might have failed to correctly understand the key condition about age "more than 5 years old" instead of including those "equal to or more than 5 years old". Also, the difficulty might come from the fact that the language model might lack sufficient programming to make the necessary logical deduction.

Improvement Needed: The prompt might need to clarify that the language model should be able to interpret and operate with basic logical and numerical conditions such as "more than", "less than", "equal to", etc. correctly.

Prompt Improvement:

Analyze the given data set, track all modifications, and answer questions based on the updated data, making sure you understand logical and numerical conditions such as "more than", "less than", "equal to", etc. accurately. Focus on the careful interpretation of categories specified in the question and the context in which they occur.

The prompt may also need a portion that explains the kind of output the model should produce. The model could possibly benefit from clearer task-related instructions or goals. For example, you can specify that the model needs to analyze single or multiple data sets, carefully interpret the categories and rules given in the questions, and provide answers that adhere strictly to the question's requirements.

By focusing on the logical and numerical aspects of the data interpretations and ensuring the model's ability to generate precise, as per the question's required output, we can improve its performance and reduce errors like the one seen here.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weight more than 12 kg?
Model's Answer: C. 3
Correct Answer: A. 1

Analysis: The issue here seems to be that the model does not carefully consider both conditions for counting the penguins. Even though it correctly updates the data (removes Bernard and adds James), it does not apply the weight condition correctly. Gwen is the only penguin that is both older than 5 years and weighs more than 12 kg; the model incorrectly counts Vincent and James, who are over 5 years old but weigh less than or equal to 12 kg.

<2> 
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Model's Answer: C. 7
Correct Answer: A. 5

Analysis: In this case, the model seems to mix up the data from both tables (penguins and giraffes). It seems to consider that there are three penguins and four giraffes older than 5 years, which totals seven. However, the penguin named Bernard is 5 years old, not more than 5 years, so he should not be included in the final count. 

<3> 
Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Model's Answer: C. 3
Correct Answer: B. 2

Analysis: The error here is similar to the one in the second example. The model includes Jody in the count, who is exactly 5 years old and not more than 5 years old. Although it seems to correctly analyze that the question refers only to the giraffe data, it does not apply the age condition correctly.

Improvement Suggestions: 

1. The prompt might need to specify more clearly that the conditions mentioned in the question (such as 'more than 5 years old') should be carefully and strictly interpreted (e.g., exactly 5 years old does not mean 'more than 5 years old').

2. It should be stressed that the model needs to discern between different datasets effectively. In questions involving multiple datasets, the model should differentiate and manage these sets accurately.

3. When tracking data modifications, it is crucial to accurately implement the changes (additions, deletions) and then to account for these changes when responding to subsequent questions. 

4. Moreover, when interpreting questions, the model should recognize and apply all the conditions appropriately. 

In this case, the improved prompt could be: "Analyze the provided data set and track all modifications accurately. When answering questions based on the updated data, pay close attention to the specific requirements outlined in the question. Consider conditions like 'more than' strictly and do not count values that are 'equal to'. Differentiate effectively between distinct datasets if provided. Always ensure a thorough and precise analysis before drawing conclusions or making predictions."

gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

In the first example, the task was to count the number of giraffes listed in the provided table, a simple data extraction process. The language model, however, failed to perform this straightforward task, providing an incorrect answer of zero giraffes. 

The prompt may have been too complex and verbose, diverting the model's attention from the main task at hand - counting the number of giraffes. The prompt's emphasis on accurate tracking of modifications and differentiation of 'more than' and 'equal to' conditions does not apply to this particular task, potentially confusing the model or leading it towards the wrong direction.  

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:

In example two, the task was to count the number of penguins in the new updated list that were more than 5 years old and weighed more than 12 kg. The model answered incorrectly by incorrectly identifying the number of penguins that fit that criteria.

The prompt's verbosity and intricacy could again be at fault, perhaps leading the model to over-analyze the data and wrongly interpret the weight specification in the query. Despite the prompt instructing differentiation between 'more than' and 'equal to', the model incorrectly defined penguins that weigh equal to 12 kg as weighing 'more than' 12 kg. 

Prompt Improvement:

Based on the behavior showcased in these examples, the prompt can be improved by:

1. Simplifying instructions: Use clear and straightforward language to avoid unnecessary complexity that may lead to errors. 

2. Clarifying tasks: Provide clear instructions for each task, such as differentiating 'more than' from 'equal to', counting items, tracking changes, etc., depending on what is required for the specific task. 

3. Eliminating unnecessary information: Excessive detail about unrelated tasks can confuse the model and lead to incorrect answers. Tailor the prompt's instructions to suit the specific task at hand and remove unrelated instructions.

By addressing these aspects, a streamlined and task-specific prompt might improve the performance of the language model.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

From the updated data set, we can see that there are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg: Vincent, Gwen, and James.

Therefore, the answer is <(C) 3>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

In the first example, the task was to count the number of giraffes listed in the provided table, a simple data extraction process. The language model, however, failed to perform this straightforward task, providing an incorrect answer of zero giraffes. 

The prompt may have been too complex and verbose, diverting the model's attention from the main task at hand - counting the number of giraffes. The prompt's emphasis on accurate tracking of modifications and differentiation of 'more than' and 'equal to' conditions does not apply to this particular task, potentially confusing the model or leading it towards the wrong direction.  

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:

In example two, the task was to count the number of penguins in the new updated list that were more than 5 years old and weighed more than 12 kg. The model answered incorrectly by incorrectly identifying the number of penguins that fit that criteria.

The prompt's verbosity and intricacy could again be at fault, perhaps leading the model to over-analyze the data and wrongly interpret the weight specification in the query. Despite the prompt instructing differentiation between 'more than' and 'equal to', the model incorrectly defined penguins that weigh equal to 12 kg as weighing 'more than' 12 kg. 

Prompt Improvement:

Based on the behavior showcased in these examples, the prompt can be improved by:

1. Simplifying instructions: Use clear and straightforward language to avoid unnecessary complexity that may lead to errors. 

2. Clarifying tasks: Provide clear instructions for each task, such as differentiating 'more than' from 'equal to', counting items, tracking changes, etc., depending on what is required for the specific task. 

3. Eliminating unnecessary information: Excessive detail about unrelated tasks can confuse the model and lead to incorrect answers. Tailor the prompt's instructions to suit the specific task at hand and remove unrelated instructions.

By addressing these aspects, a streamlined and task-specific prompt might improve the performance of the language model.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
- In this example, the task relates to understanding, tracking, and implementing changes to a simple dataset (in this case, a small list of fictional penguins), as well as interpreting a question based on the adjusted dataset. The question asks how many penguins are less than 8 years old.
- The model's mistake is fundamental because it simply miscounted the number of penguins younger than 8 years old. It mistakenly counted the 9-year-old penguin, Vincent, as being less than 8 years old.
- This mistake was not due to a failure of the prompt, which made it clear that attention should be paid to accurately interpreting the data, including differentiating 'more than' from 'equal to'. Therefore, one can surmise that it wasn't the prompt that misled the model in this case, but an inherent comprehension error within the model itself.

Wrong Example 2:
- Here, the model is dealing with two separate tables: one for penguins and another for giraffes. While it appears the model correctly segregates the two datasets, it once again fails to correctly answer the question, which asks how many giraffes are more than 5 years old.
- The model miscounted the ages of giraffes. It considered the 5-year-old giraffe, Jody, as being 'more than' 5 years old, which is incorrect based on the specifications of the question.
- Again, the mistake seems to lie with the model's understanding of the problem rather than with the prompt itself, which very clearly differentiates 'more than' from 'equal to', emphasizing the need for precision when interpreting conditions in the question.

Prompt Improvement:
- While in these instances the errors seem to stem more from model comprehension missteps rather than prompt issues, there are a few potential directions for prompt enhancement.
- It could further emphasize the importance of understanding the specifics of the conditions given in the question, for example, the crucial difference between 'more than' and 'less than' which is not equals to.
- The prompt could also stress more explicitly the need to separately and carefully examine each dataset when multiple are presented. 
- Another aspect might be to underscore more straightforwardly the importance of tracking changes to the dataset, as this could potentially help the model better remember modifications (additions, deletions, etc.).

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1>: In this question, the model is asked to sort the names of giraffes in alphabetical order and pick the last one. The model fails to provide the correct answer because the prompt does not explicitly instruct it to consider the alphabetical order of the objects available in the data. The prompt commands to track modifications, to be precise, and to distinguish among conditions - however, there is nothing about sorting data alphabetically. As such, the model has selected "Donna" probably based on the position in the original dataset, not considering the alphabetical sorting rule.

Based on this analysis, the aspects that can improve the prompt are:

1. Include instructions aimed to handle and interpret a wider range of data structures, such as sorting a dataset alphabetically or numerically as required.

2. Ask the model to consider all relevant conditions for the required action - for instance, in the case of sorting, it should be explicitly asked to consider the sorting rules applicable to the dataset.

3. The prompt may also need to instruct the model to either ignore the original order of the inputs or acknowledge it based on the specific task.

4. It would be useful to indicate that the sequence or positions of entities in the input data, in certain cases, could not represent the correct answer to the posed question which requires additional processing.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine how many animals are more than 5 years old, we need to analyze both the penguin and giraffe datasets.

In the penguin dataset, we have Louis (7 years old), Bernard (5 years old), Vincent (9 years old), and Gwen (8 years old). This means that there are 3 penguins who are more than 5 years old.

In the giraffe dataset, we have Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), Marian (2 years old), and Donna (9 years old). This means that there are 3 giraffes who are more than 5 years old.

Combining both datasets, we have a total of 6 animals who are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 6</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> For the first question, the model's mistake is its interpretation of the condition 'more than'. Although the model correctly differentiated between the 'more than', 'equal to', and 'less than' conditions, it did not apply it correctly. It considered Bernard and Jody, who both are "equal to" 5 as equivalent to "more than" 5. This lack of consideration leads to an overestimation of animals who are over 5 years old, resulting in the wrong answer.

<2> For the second question, the model once again made an error in interpreting the 'more than' condition. It considered Jody as 'more than 5 years old' when her age is actually exactly 5 years old. Consequently, it counted one extra giraffe in its calculation, leading to an incorrect response.

Improvements:
Several improvements can be considered to avoid these errors:

1. Clear Instructions: Although the prompt requires the model to differentiate between 'more than', 'equal to', and 'less than', it seems the model is not precisely following it. It could be more explicit with the distinctions between these conditions. For example, "Bear in mind that 'more than 5' does not include '5', at the same time, 'less than 5' does not include '5', either."

2. Demo: Providing a small example or demonstration at the start where the model is shown the correct discrimination of values between 'more than', 'equal to', and 'less than' could be beneficial.

3. Elucidated Explanation: When the model performs the calculations, it can be instructed to detail out the reasoning and steps for added transparency. For example, the model should explain that it didn't count Bernard and Jody as they are 'equal to 5' years old, and not 'more than 5.' 

4. Check Work: The model could be asked to review its answer against the semi-formal definition of "strictly more than", reaffirming that it should not include the boundary condition. 

Implementing these modifications will potentially improve the accuracy of the model when differentiating between ‘more than’, ‘equal to’, and ‘less than’.

gradient:
Example 1:

There was confusion in the interpretation of the comparison "less than". The language model (LM) gave an incorrect analysis of "less than" 8 as it included the penguin Gwen, who is exactly 8 years old. According to the question, the model should consider penguins with age only under 8. Thus, the correct answer should have been 1 instead of 2. This reveals the model's misunderstanding of the specific comparison terminology, in line with the task description.

Example 2:

While the dataset had two separate categories - 'penguins' and 'giraffes', the language model did not segregate and analyze them independently as per the instructions. Instead, the model included the data from the category 'penguins' into the 'giraffes' making the total number of giraffes who are more than 5 years old incorrectly as 3 instead of 2. This underlines a malfunctioning of the model's ability to effectively segregate and analyze multiple datasets independently.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. Comparison Clarity: The language model needs to better understand comparative terms such as 'less than', 'equal to', and 'more than'. Make explicit specifications to ensure that 'less than' does not include the exact value.

2. Data Segregation: Specify more clearly that when multiple datasets are provided, the comparison and calculations for each must be done separately. 

3. Re-emphasize Data Update: Reiterate the importance of accurately considering each change made to the dataset, including the addition or deletion of any entries. 

4. Result Independence: The model needs to be encouraged not to mix results from different questions or datasets, thereby ensuring that the answer corresponds exactly to the question and dataset it associates with.

Revised Prompt:

Begin a thorough review and analysis of the given data set(s), keeping track of all quantifiable changes and ensuring accurate consideration of every update, such as additions or deletions. Separate multiple datasets effectively and process each individually. Clearly distinguish between the relational values of 'more than' (exclusive of the value at comparison), 'equal to', and 'less than' (also exclusive of the value at comparison). Carefully apply these conditions when comparing and identifying data values within each set. Respond diligently to queries based on this updated information, paying extra attention to all conditions, categories, and criteria highlighted in the question. Draw conclusions with utmost precision, ensuring it is based on an exhaustive understanding and interpretation of the updated data. Your final answer should align precisely with one of the provided choices, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Commence with a meticulous analysis of the provided data set, precisely tracking all changes and ensuring that every modification has been accurately considered. Differentiate very clearly between 'more than', 'equal to', and 'less than', carefully interpreting these conditions when comparing and analyzing data values. When multiple datasets are put forth, segregate them effectively and analyze each one independently. Diligently answer questions based on the updated data, paying close attention to all conditionals, categories, and criteria specified in the enquiry. Finally, draw your conclusions with complete precision, making sure they arise from an exhaustive and comprehensive understanding and interpretation of the reformed data. Your final answer should correspond exactly to one of the provided options, bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are less than 8 years old?

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15
James, 12, 90, 12

There are 2 penguins less than 8 years old, which are Louis (7 years old) and Gwen (8 years old).

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(B) 2</answer>.

In this example, the prompt is instructive and explicitly detailed about the steps the model should take in analyzing the datasets and responding to the queries. However, it seems this prompt over complicate things, potentially leading the AI to overanalyze or make errors in simple arithmetic-based tasks. 

In this particular question, the model inaccurately counted the number of giraffes more than 5 years old. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the term 'more than', which excluded giraffes whose age was equal to 5.

This suggests that while the prompt has been armed with extensive detail about data analysis, interpretation and answering approach, it might lack clarity on numeric comparisons like 'more than', 'equal to', and 'less than', specifically when 'equal to' a certain number. 

A possible reason for the wrong answer could be that the model did not separate and analyze the giraffes data effectively. Perhaps the meticulous analysis pointed out in the prompt caused it to over-complicate the simple counting task.

Improvements:

1. Simplify the prompt - The extensive detail in the prompt might lead to over-complication of simple tasks. The essence of the prompt can be retained while making it simpler and clearer.
2. Explicit Numeric Comparisons Instructions - Clarify the instructions about treating numeric comparisons specifically about 'more than', 'equal to', 'less than' to avoid confusion.
3. Clearer Dataset Analysis - Clearly specify that the different datasets should be analysed separately.
4. Clear Value Comparison - Instructions should be added emphasizing the importance of direct number to number comparison when asked.
5. More clarity on Counting Tasks - Emphasize the exactness needed when simply counting the number of items falling into specific categories.
6. Instructions on Option Generation - If the model is also generating the options, explicit instructions about the consideration of all possible options with regard to the problem could help make the generated options more fitting to the question. 
7. Guiding towards Correct Option - When pinpointing final answer, the model should be guided to cross-verify with the question.
   
These improvements ensure that the model better understands the task at hand, enabling it to analyze the data set precisely and answer correctly.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the penguin dataset, there are 4 penguins listed, and all of them are more than 5 years old. Therefore, the number of penguins that are more than 5 years old is 4.

In the giraffe dataset, there are 4 giraffes listed, and 3 of them are more than 5 years old (Jody, Gladys, and Donna).

Combining both datasets, there are a total of 7 animals that are more than 5 years old.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) 7</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
For this example, the prompt instructs the model to "rigorously analyze the provided data set", "carefully heed to all rules, conditions, and categories specified in the query", "differentiate strictly between 'more than' and 'equal to'", "segregate them effectively and consider each set independently in relation to the task" and "be entirely precise in your final conclusions". The problem in this example seems to be with differentiating strictly between 'more than' and 'equal to.' In the question “How many animals are more than 5 years old?”, the term 'more than 5 years old' includes those animals which are 6 years or older, whereas the model misinterpreted the prompt and considered animals who are exactly 5 years old as well. 

Reasons:

1. Misinterpretation of Age Criteria: The main issue stems from the misinterpretation of the term 'more than'. The prompt instructs the model to differentiate strictly between 'more than' and 'equal to', and in the context of the question, it should have considered animals who are 6 years or older. The model incorrectly counted animals who were exactly 5 years old which led to an erroneous result.

2. Detailed Clarification: The prompt should include more detailed clarification on terminologies such as 'more than' and 'equal to' that frequently cause confusion.

Aspects to Improve:

1. Define Terminologies: More precise definition or explanation of terms like 'more than', 'equal to', 'less than', etc., should be included in the prompt to guide the model appropriately.

2. Provide hypothetical prompt examples: These would help the model understand the correct interpretation of these terminologies in diverse contexts. 

3. Precise Construction of Sentences: Construct sentences in the prompt so that they don't leave room for ambiguous interpretations.

Modified Prompt:

Analyze the data set provided to you critically. Accurately track all modifications and ensure that all alterations are accounted for. When it's time to answer the question based on this data, ensure you follow all rules, conditions, and categories specified in the query. This includes those specifications that pertain to the alphabetical or numerical order of data items. Be mindful to distinguish between 'more than' (excludes the exact number) and 'equal to or more than' (includes the exact number). If you're given more than one dataset, treat them as separate entities and relate each to the task independently. As you work through the data, make sure you're looking out for task-associated keywords or phrases such as 'sort', 'last', 'more than', 'less than', etc. The original sequence or order of entities in the input data may not yield the correct answer, especially if the task requires additional processing or sorting. Your final conclusions need to be precise, and they should be derived from a meticulous, exhaustive, and task-specific interpretation of the tracked data.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

gradient:
Example 1: 

Question: How many penguins are more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg?
The model's answer: (B) 2
Correct answer: (A) 1

Step by Step Analysis: 

1. The model seemed to correctly track the modifications made to the dataset — it acknowledged the addition of "James" and the deletion of "Bernard". 
2. The model misunderstood the application of both conditions 'more than 5 years old' and 'weigh more than 12 kg'. While it took these conditions into consideration, it miscalculated by considering them individually, not collectively - it counted Vincent, who is more than 5 years old, but does not weigh more than 12kg, and Gwen, who weighs more than 12kg, but is not more than 5 years old.
3. As such, it misinterpreted the data and gave the wrong answer.

Reasons for the Error:

1. The model likely misinterpreted the phrase “more than 5 years old and weigh more than 12 kg” as two separate conditions rather than as one joint condition. This caused it to incorrectly include penguins only meeting one of the conditions.
2. The model seems not to fully understand the logical conjunction "and" - it should only count the entities that fulfil both conditions. 

Areas of Improvement:

1. We need to encourage a complete interpretation of combined conditions. The model should fully comprehend that when conditions are jointed by 'and', it means the entity must satisfy both conditions.
2. The model should be trained to more critically analyze the meaning of conjunctions like "and" in the context of data analysis.
3. The prompt could further emphasize on understanding the task-specific keywords or phrases correctly and precisely.
4. Lastly, the prompt could include something about fully understanding the conditions and applying all of them correctly in order to yield the correct result.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Rigorously analyze the provided data set, accurately track all modifications, and ensure all changes are accurately accounted for. When you answer the question based on the updated data, carefully heed to all rules, conditions, and categories specified in the query, including those relevant to the alphabetical or numerical order of data items.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody (5 years old), Gladys (10 years old), and Donna (9 years old).

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.

(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
After deleting Bernard from the table, we are left with three penguins:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

Among these penguins, only Vincent is more than 8 years old. Therefore, the answer is:

(B) 2
<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The prompt instructs the model to differentiate strictly between 'more than' and 'equal to'. This is where the model gets confused - it considers the giraffe 'Jody' who is exactly 5 years old as being 'more than' 5 years old. The instruction can lead to ambiguity in certain conditions, especially when the data exactly matches the threshold condition as in this example. 

Another possible cause is the lengthy nature of the prompt, which might lead to the dilution of the focus on specific instructions in the problem statement. The prompt's complexity could potentially distract the model’s attention from simple but important instructions in the query.

Wrong Example 2:
Again, the issue here lies with the misunderstanding of the term 'more than'. The model considers the penguin 'Gwen' who is 8 years old as being 'more than' 8 years old. 

The model-generalized prompt might not be sufficient for handling task-specific conditions. The prompt focuses on analyzing the data rigorously, but it does not convey the importance of understanding the context or semantics of the presented task. 

Ways to improve the prompt:
1. Make the differentiation between 'more than' and 'equal to' more explicit. It may be beneficial to explicitly state that 'more than' does not include the stated number.
2. Simplify the prompt and reduce its length to avoid dilution of focus.
3. Include instructions in the prompt about understanding the semantics of the queries explicitly.
4. It could be beneficial to instruct the model to justify its answer - this may ensure a greater adherence to the question's logic.
5. The model might benefit from additional clarification on treating each query independently, regardless of prior queries.
6. The model should be instructed that table manipulation actions such as adding or removing entities should be followed explicitly without any assumptions.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We then delete the penguin named Bernard from the table.
How many penguins are more than 8 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
After deleting Bernard from the table, we are left with three penguins:
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

Among these penguins, only Vincent is more than 8 years old. Therefore, the answer is:
(B) 2 <answer></answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example 1, the model gets the answer wrong because it includes the age of '8' in its count for the penguins which are 'less than 8 years old.' In the prompt, there was a specification to "Distinguish between 'more than' (exclusive of the stated number) and 'equal to,'" but this distinction was not made as the model included the 'equal to' case in its computation. A more explicit reminder to exclude the 'equal to' case when the query specifies 'less than' or 'more than' might help the model achieve better accuracy.

For example 2, the model predicts the wrong answer 'B' rather than the correct answer 'A'. This is possibly due to an issue with parsing the multiple-choice options or an error in the internal dataset tracking or computation logic. The prompt was explicit about treating 'more than' as an exclusive condition, implying that '8' should not be included, but the model seems to have misunderstood or ignored this instruction.

Reasons for Wrong Answers:
1. The model not accurately following instructions on treating 'less than' and 'more than' numbers as exclusive, not inclusive.
2. There might be a model error in tracking dataset modifications, inferring conditions, or computing answers. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
1. Include explicit instructions to treat 'less than' and 'more than' as exclusive of the number stated.
2. Reinforce the importance of careful examination and tracking of dataset modifications.
3. Emphasize understanding and accurately executing data query conditions, ensuring the model discusses its logic and understanding of instructions. 
4. Specify that if table modifications are involved, the model needs to reason explicitly about subtracting or adding rows in the table.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> The Wrong Example:
Despite the instructions in the prompt, the model incorrectly predicts the number of penguins after an addition in the table. The prompt instructs "accurately tracking any modifications made" and being "cautious about the rules, categories, and conditions," but it seems the model failed to track the addition of the penguin 'James' properly, which should change the count of penguins to 5. This shows that the model might not be fully processing or understanding the concepts of data tracking or making needed modifications to essential variables.

<2> The Wrong Example:
In this second example, the model made an incorrect assumption about the question by misunderstanding the term 'more than.' Despite the instructions in the prompt that distinguish 'more than' (exclusive of the stated number) from 'equal to,' the model treated 'more than 5 years old' as inclusive of 5, leading to an overcount of the animals that fulfilled the condition. 

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Make instructions for tracking data changes clearer and more specific. The model should recognize the addition or subtraction of elements, understand the updated count or status, and consider these changes in its responses.
2. Clarify the instruction related to the understanding and application of conditions. The model should be able to distinguish between 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and other similar terms accurately.
3. Further instruction could be given for tasks involving different datasets, as seen in example 2. The model should understand how to handle multiple datasets and apply the correct question conditions to each one accordingly.
4. Additional emphasis on following every segment of the prompt. In both wrong examples, parts of the instructions were not followed correctly, leading to errors. A general instruction might be added to highlight the importance of each part of the prompt.
5. Guidance on interpreting the question correctly. It could define actionable items like looking for the main question, understanding the required output format, and other points to help the model better interpret the question.
6. Reinforce the understanding of keyword instructions, specifically regarding comparisons like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to.'
7. Instruction to verify the final answer with the condition or question asked, to reduce the likelihood of logical mistakes. 

Taking these improvements into account, the prompt can be rewritten, supplementing it for better guidance and comprehensiveness, and reinforcing parts that are pivotal. A combination of this analysis should lead to better performance by the language model in these tasks.

When concluding, ensure your final inference is derived from a comprehensive, focused interpretation of the task and your tracked data modifications. Also, justify your conclusions wherever possible to demonstrate your understanding and logic application. Treat each task independently with no reliance on prior tasks. Follow task instructions without making assumptions, particularly if table modifications like deletions or additions are involved.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the penguin dataset, there are 4 penguins listed with ages above 5 years old. In the giraffe dataset, there are 3 giraffes listed with ages above 5 years old. Therefore, the total number of animals that are more than 5 years old is 4 (penguins) + 3 (giraffes) = 7 animals.

Therefore, the answer is:
(C) 7 <answer></answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> The Wrong Example:
Despite the instructions in the prompt, the model incorrectly predicts the number of penguins after an addition in the table. The prompt instructs "accurately tracking any modifications made" and being "cautious about the rules, categories, and conditions," but it seems the model failed to track the addition of the penguin 'James' properly, which should change the count of penguins to 5. This shows that the model might not be fully processing or understanding the concepts of data tracking or making needed modifications to essential variables.

<2> The Wrong Example:
In this second example, the model made an incorrect assumption about the question by misunderstanding the term 'more than.' Despite the instructions in the prompt that distinguish 'more than' (exclusive of the stated number) from 'equal to,' the model treated 'more than 5 years old' as inclusive of 5, leading to an overcount of the animals that fulfilled the condition. 

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Make instructions for tracking data changes clearer and more specific. The model should recognize the addition or subtraction of elements, understand the updated count or status, and consider these changes in its responses.
2. Clarify the instruction related to the understanding and application of conditions. The model should be able to distinguish between 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and other similar terms accurately.
3. Further instruction could be given for tasks involving different datasets, as seen in example 2. The model should understand how to handle multiple datasets and apply the correct question conditions to each one accordingly.
4. Additional emphasis on following every segment of the prompt. In both wrong examples, parts of the instructions were not followed correctly, leading to errors. A general instruction might be added to highlight the importance of each part of the prompt.
5. Guidance on interpreting the question correctly. It could define actionable items like looking for the main question, understanding the required output format, and other points to help the model better interpret the question.
6. Reinforce the understanding of keyword instructions, specifically regarding comparisons like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to.'
7. Instruction to verify the final answer with the condition or question asked, to reduce the likelihood of logical mistakes. 

Taking these improvements into account, the prompt can be rewritten, supplementing it for better guidance and comprehensiveness, and reinforcing parts that are pivotal. A combination of this analysis should lead to better performance by the language model in these tasks.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1 wrong answer reason:
In this example, the language model misunderstood the differentiation between 'more than' and 'equal to'. While the prompt clearly stated the distinction between these two conditions, the language model failed to apply this correctly. The language model was asked to determine how many penguins are 'more than' 5 years old. It can be easy to misunderstand and count those 'equal to' 5 as well, but the terminology 'more than' excludes the number mentioned, so in this case, penguins who are exactly 5 years old should not have been counted.

Example 2 wrong answer reason:
Similar to the first example, the language model made the same mistake in understanding the phrase 'more than'. The prompt explicitly asked for giraffes that are 'more than' 5 years old. However, the model also counted the giraffe Jody, who is exactly 5 years old, along with the giraffes who were older than 5. The correct answer should have excluded Jody.

Based on the above analysis, the areas where the prompts can be improved are the following:

1. Better emphasize on numerical terminology: Even though the current prompt mentions the distinction between 'more than' and 'equal to', it seems to be not enough for the model to understand the difference. The prompt needs to stress these terminologies.


2. Providing examples might help: Including an example in the instruction may help ensure the instructions are clear. For instance, specify that if asked for 'more than 5', the count should exclude '5'.

3. Reiterate the need to understand and apply rules accurately: Reinforce the need to understand the task's conditions and rules, accurately applying them to the given task, and not making any assumptions.

4. Clarification on numerical operations: Make it clear that when dealing with numerical age data, the numerical order matters and numbers should be treated strictly as per the question's instructions. 

5. Encourage attention to detail: While the model correctly identified the task and managed to analyze the data, it slightly misinterpreted the conditions of the task. Therefore, re-emphasize the need to pay careful attention to every single word or phrase, as they can significantly change the meaning of the task.

By considering these aspects, the prompt can be revised and refined for better performance in the future.

<START> Carefully analyze the delivered dataset and diligently track all modifications. For any updates made to the data, ensure you accurately account for those alterations. When answering a question based on this evolved dataset, pay absolute attention to any and all rules, conditions, subject categories, and sequences specified such as alphabetical or numerical orders. Be entirely aware of the explicit difference between 'more than' and 'equal to'. Understand that 'more than' does not include the exact number stated and will always be exclusive of it. Conversely, 'equal to' corresponds to the exact value.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The giraffes that are more than 5 years old are Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
For the question: "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?"
The model's response is: "The giraffes that are more than 5 years old are Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(C) 3</answer>"
However, the correct answer is (B) 2 because the term "more than" should exclude giraffes precisely 5 years old. Thus, Jody who is exactly 5 years old shouldn't be included.
 
Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Misinterpretation of 'more than': The first possible reason for this mistake is the model's misinterpretation of the term 'more than'. Although the prompt explicitly mentions that 'more than' should exclude the given value, the model erroneously includes the value itself. This results in an overcount.
2. Error in segregating datasets: While the prompt advises to treat multiple datasets independently, the model may have failed to clearly identify and segregate the giraffes dataset from the penguins dataset. A confusion between datasets can lead to incorrect inferences.
   
Improvements: 
1. Provide clearer instructions on understanding and interpreting 'more than' vs. 'equal to or more than'. Emphasize the need for the differentiation and accurate counting based on these conditions.
2. Include explicit instructions about treating distinct datasets independently. Ensure the model recognises the headers, separators and terminates treating one dataset before starting with another one.
3. Clearly explain how to treat numerical data within categories, and the need to make accurate inferences from such data.
4. Possibly include instructions on correctly reading data from tables, such as reading horizontally within a row for a single entity's complete data and reading vertically within a column for all data within a category.
5. Reiterate the need for absolute precision in conclusions and encourage double-checking before finalising responses.
6. Include more guidance about how to handle edge cases like values exactly on the boundary when considering 'more than' or 'less than' type conditions.

Question: How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Wrong Answer: (C) 3
Correct Label: (B) 2

Reasoning: The model seems to have misinterpreted the task-specific terminology "more than", treating it as "equal to or more than". This is evident in how it categorizes Jody, who is exactly 5 years old, in the count of giraffes that are "more than 5 years old". Due to this, the model overestimated the count by one, hence arriving at the incorrect answer.

Aspects to improve:
1. Greater Clarity on Task-Specific Terminology: The model's understanding of task-specific terminology such as "more than" could be improved. It should be clearer that “more than” signifies values strictly greater than the given threshold, not equal to or greater than the threshold.
2. Training on More Data: To comprehend the differences and subtleties between different terms and the way they influence the answer, the model might benefit from training on a broader and more diverse data set.
3. Emphasize Importance of Precision: The prompt should emphasize the importance of precision and careful interpretation of given conditions in the question.
4. Requirement Clarification: The language model may also need more clarification or examples that illustrate the required output or outcomes to improve its understanding and application of the task at hand.

gradient:
Example 1:

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?

Model's Response: (D) Donna

Correct Answer: (C) Marian

Explanation: The model's mistake in this situation might be due to a misunderstanding of the term 'last' in the context of the question. The model might have sorted the names in ascending alphabetical order and picked the one at the end, Donna, which is wrong in this context. However, the question is asking for the name that ranks last in alphabetical order, which should be Marian.

Potential Improvement: The prompt could be enhanced by clarifying the interpretation of certain terms like 'last'. In addition, the prompt could also be improved by instructing the model to handle complex queries better, such as those that require steps or specific attention to task-specific terminologies. The model could also be trained to handle and understand the context better. For instance, recognizing how the names should be ranked alphabetically, and understanding that 'last' in this context means the last in subsequence when sorted alphabetically. 

This improvement may help the model recognize the sequence in which the names are ranked and identify the last name when sorted in alphabetical order. Perhaps more emphasis on steps where 'sorting' is required and how to interpret 'sorted data' in order to answer various types of questions would improve the performance in such contexts.

Aim for precision in your final conclusions, which should reflect a robust, comprehensive, and task-specific data interpretation.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11

Wrong Example Analysis:

In Example <1>, the prompt provided the language model, in part, showed an expectation to track modifications in the dataset. The prompt leads to the model correctly acknowledging the removal of the penguin named Bernard. However, the incorrect prediction shows that the model is not interpreting the question perfectly.

The question asked in the example is "How many penguins are more than 8 years old?" This means the model should focus on penguins whose age is greater than 8. However, the model incorrectly includes Gwen who is just 8 years old and not above 8. This suggests that there might be instances where the model misinterprets the relational operators such as 'greater than'.

Also, the model did not validate its calculation by rechecking the age of the remaining penguins in the dataset. The prompt instructed the model to validate all its calculations before providing a result, but the wrong output implies that the model didn't perform this accurately. 

Improvements:

1. The prompt needs to emphasize the understanding and application of relational operators in the task.
2. The language model should consider all factors within the question. Precise attention to details should be highlighted in the prompt.
3. Instructions for validation needs to be clearer and more stringent.
4. Reinforce the model's ability to adapt to updates, such as deletions, and re-examine the updated data set before answering the question.
5. Necessary to also focus on the compliance with the specifications of the question.
6. The model needs to be encouraged to interpret and answer based on the modified dataset meticulously.

gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the model gets the quantity of giraffes older than 5 years wrong. It seems the prompt led the model to an incorrect assumption, as it counted Jody who is exactly 5 years old, not more than 5. As a result, the model has counted an extra giraffe, resulting in the wrong prediction (C) instead of (B).

<2> 
In this example, the model had to determine the last giraffe when sorted alphabetically. The model incorrectly identified 'Donna' as the last name in alphabetical order. This suggests that the model may not fully understand the concept of alphabetical order, or it may have been confused by the prompt language, leading to this error.

<3> 
In this example, the model needed to account for changes made to the dataset (adding and deleting entries). However, it did not accurately track deletions, as evidenced by counting Bernard as being less than 8 years old, despite Bernard being removed from the dataset. That's why the output is wrong (B, two penguins) instead of (A, one penguin).

From these analysis of the incorrect responses, the aspects to be improved in the prompt include:

1. The prompt should clearly specify that the model must take into account the exact conditions in the questions, such as value boundaries (greater, less, equal, more than, less than, maximum, etc.).

2. The task should clearly state that grasp the basic algorithms, like sorting in alphabetical or numerical order and be able to correctly follow these instructions.

3. The task should instruct the model that it needs to track the updates, including both the new entries and deletions, accurately on the dataset.

4. Providing examples that demonstrate the desired output per every given category could also be beneficial in defining what steps should be followed in the computation. It gives the model a reference point to base its processes on.

5. The prompt should also include directions for procedure when dealing with potential confusion or ambiguities in the task.

6. It's necessary to reinforce the idea that validation needs to occur immediately after computation, this will remind the model to correct any misunderstanding about the task requirements before proposing a result.

gradient:
<1> 
Wrong Example Analysis:
In this case, the model's error comes from its wrong comprehension of the data - namely, it mistakenly counts Jody who is 5 years old as a giraffe over 5 years old. This shows that the model doesn't accurately process the conditions mentioned within the questions, especially dealing with greater-than and equal-to conditions.

Reasons:
1. Unclear condition processing: The prompt doesn't emphasize the importance of precise and unambiguous comprehension of conditions listed in questions. It merely asks the model for general accuracy, not specific parsing of condition details.
2. Mathematical logic: The language model might have failed to differentiate between "more than 5" and "5 or more", which could cause accurate mathematical representations or logic to be missed.

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Enhance the importance of accurate understanding of conditions: The prompt should put more emphasis on the need for proper comprehension and interpretation of specific conditions or criteria mentioned within the questions.
2. Emphasize mathematical logic: The prompt should stress the necessity of correctly interpreting and applying mathematical logic and greater-than/less-than relations.
3. Iterative verification: The prompt should urge the model to cross-verify its interpretations with the original conditions in the question, ensuring that the response aligns with the problem's specifications.
4. Precision with specifications: The prompt should stress the need to stay within the constraints and context of the question, ensuring age is correctly interpreted and the model doesn't assume values outside the given context.

gradient:
<1> 

In the first example, the question asked for the number of penguins that are more than 8 years old. The model made two mistakes:

Mistake 1: Misinterpretation of the Operator
The model incorrectly understood the operator 'more than'. More than 8 years old doesn't include 8 years old; it means only those penguins who are 9 or above. But the model included Gwen, who is exactly 8 years old.

Mistake 2: Wrong Answer
After misinterpreting the operator, the model gave option (B) 2 as the response, while the correct answer should have been (A) 1.

<2> 

In the second example, the question asked for the total number of animals that are more than 5 years old. The model made two mistakes:

Mistake 1: Misinterpretation of the Operator
Similar to the first example, the model wrongly included the animals who are exactly 5 years old (Bernard and Jody), which is incorrect as the question specifically asked for the number of animals older than 5 years. 

Mistake 2: Wrong Answer
Due to the wrong interpretation of the operator, the model answered (C) 7, while the correct answer is (A) 5.

Summary:

Reasons leading to wrong answer:
1. Misinterpreting the operator 'more than' led the model to include numbers equal to the comparator as well.
2. Incorrect calculations due to the misinterpretation led to wrong answers. 

Improvements for the prompt:
1. The language model prompt could stress more on the correct interpretation of the relational operators like 'greater than', 'less than', and 'equal to'.
2. The prompt should instruct the model to consider the strict definition of operators, to not include the number when the operator 'more than' or 'less than' is used.
3. Remind the model to base its answers solely and accurately on the provided dataset with no assumptions or extraneous information. 
4. The prompt could encourage the model to use extreme precision and careful review when analyzing relational operators in questions. 

Therefore, the enhanced prompt may look like: 

Prompt: 
Your task is to analyze the provided dataset and track all modifications including deletions and additions, Ensure each change is confirmed. Use the updated dataset to interpret and answer the questions. Pay acute attention to the specifics included in the questions, especially categories and relational operators like 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', etc. Note that 'more than' and 'less than' do not include the exact number. Ensure your computations are validated using the modified dataset before providing the final response. Your interpretation and answers must meet the standards of the question, leaving no room for ambiguity. Prioritize accuracy, ensure your responses are based solely on the updated dataset, and check for any computational errors. We value precise and accurate responses over speed.

gradient:
<1> 
In this prompt, the language model is instructed to "analyze the provided data set." However, the model might misunderstand the question due to the use of ambiguous phrases such as "meticulously tracking all modifications." The model may mistakenly interpret that there were previous changes to the data set. In this instance, there were no modifications presented in the dataset that affect the final answer. The model is instructed to pay attention to categories and relational operators, but it did not correctly consider the relational operator 'greater than' with respect to ages in this question. The prompt overemphasizes checking and calculating all modifications of the data, but does not stress enough on correctly identifying and interpreting essential information - in this case, the age of the penguins. 

Reasons why the previous prompt failed:
1. The excessive mention of modifications might lead the model to overthink and presume changes that did not occur, deviating from the focus of the question.
2. The model misinterprets the question or fails to address the 'greater than' operator properly, although the prompt instructed to look out for this.
3. The prompt didn’t stress enough on interpretational accuracy of the original data and identifying key details. 

Improvements to prompt:
1. Clearly instruct the model that not all data sets will have modifications and to focus more on the essential data presented.
2. Direct the model to adequately and accurately consider relational operators.
3. Place a greater emphasis on the accurate interpretation of the original data over any potential modifications.
4. Guide the model towards identifying crucial details within the dataset correctly. This includes recognizing crucial categories, the impacts they may have on the final answer.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the question "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?", the model answered D (for 4) while the correct answer is C (for 3). The model made an error while applying the relation operator "greater than". It treated the age of 5 as inclusive when the question specifically asked for more than 5 years old.

<2> 
In answering the question "Which penguin has the first name of a famous jazzman?", the model chose C (Vincent) while the correct answer is A (Louis). Here, the model made an assumption based on external information outside the scope of the provided dataset and prompt. The model used its internal knowledge about a famous jazzman named Vincent Herring. However, the more widely known musician in this context is Louis Armstrong, therefore the correct answer should be Louis.

<3> 
In this example, the model was asked "How many penguins are there in the table?" after adding a penguin to the table. Despite the addition to the dataset, the model failed to update its response accordingly, choosing A (for 1) while the correct response is E (for 5). 

<4> 
The question being asked was "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?". The model incorrectly answered C (for 3) while the correct answer was B (for 2). Similar to the first example, the model incorrectly applied the relation operator "greater than", treating it as inclusive of the age 5.

To improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear that relation operators like 'greater than', 'less than' are not inclusive unless explicitly stated in the question.
2. Indicate that the model should answer based solely on the information contained in the data set and question, without reference to external information or assumptions.
3. Stress the importance of tracking additions or deletions made to the dataset as mentioned in the question.
4. Remind the model to stick strictly to the data details and question specifics, and double-check computations.
5. Specify that the model must strictly follow the provided data and should not extrapolate or make assumptions outside the provided data. It's important for the model to always align with the standards of the question.

(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 3 giraffes that are more than 5 years old: Jody, Gladys, and Donna.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(C) 3</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In the question "How many penguins are more than 5 years old?", the model answered D (for 4) while the correct answer is C (for 3). The model made an error while applying the relation operator "greater than". It treated the age of 5 as inclusive when the question specifically asked for more than 5 years old.

<2> 
In answering the question "Which penguin has the first name of a famous jazzman?", the model chose C (Vincent) while the correct answer is A (Louis). Here, the model made an assumption based on external information outside the scope of the provided dataset and prompt. The model used its internal knowledge about a famous jazzman named Vincent Herring. However, the more widely known musician in this context is Louis Armstrong, therefore the correct answer should be Louis.

<3> 
In this example, the model was asked "How many penguins are there in the table?" after adding a penguin to the table. Despite the addition to the dataset, the model failed to update its response accordingly, choosing A (for 1) while the correct response is E (for 5). 

<4> 
The question being asked was "How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?". The model incorrectly answered C (for 3) while the correct answer was B (for 2). Similar to the first example, the model incorrectly applied the relation operator "greater than", treating it as inclusive of the age 5.

To improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear that relation operators like 'greater than', 'less than' are not inclusive unless explicitly stated in the question.
2. Indicate that the model should answer based solely on the information contained in the data set and question, without reference to external information or assumptions.
3. Stress the importance of tracking additions or deletions made to the dataset as mentioned in the question.
4. Remind the model to stick strictly to the data details and question specifics, and double-check computations.
5. Specify that the model must strictly follow the provided data and should not extrapolate or make assumptions outside the provided data. It's important for the model to always align with the standards of the question.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Looking at the first example, one of the reasons why the model got the answer wrong might be due to the lack of understanding of the condition "more than". It is specified in the prompt that "more than" and "less than" exclude the exact numbers. However, the model might have misunderstood this condition and included giraffes who are exactly 5 years old. As a result, it incorrectly counted Jody (5), Gladys (10), and Donna (9), which led to the answer (C) 3, whereas the correct answer is (B) 2, which didn't include Jody(5).

In the second example, the model might have misunderstood the instruction "last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order". Instead, the model might have focused on the last name provided in the dataset, which is Donna. Misunderstanding of the question and lacking a clear understanding of alphabetical sorting might have led to its wrong conclusion. The correct answer should be Marian when the names are sorted in alphabetical order.

Different Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) More explicit instructions for "more than" and "less than"
Instead of just saying that the "more than" and "less than" operators exclude the exact number, give more explicit examples or better wording to ensure the model understands this point correctly.

2) Elaborate on what "sorting" means
The model seems to be confused about the idea of sorting, so providing a mini-lesson or examples could help the model better understand this concept.

3) Better emphasis on the updated dataset
Although the original prompt does mention the updated dataset, the model might not fully comprehend the importance of using the latest data for computations and analysis. Put more emphasis on the updated dataset and make it explicit to revisit any changes in the dataset.

4) Request for step-by-step analysis
The model could be steered towards showing its work step by step while making calculations. This can allow the model to better understand what exactly it is doing, thereby reducing errors. 

5) Specify the importance of precision and accuracy 
The model confused the terms 'more than' and 'equal to'. Perhaps, emphasize the difference between the two and the importance of providing the exact answer according to the requirements of the question. 

6) Instill value of a double-check process 
The model might have benefitted from a rechecking procedure to spot any possible mistakes. It would be wise to include this as a must-do step in the instructions.
  
7) Make sure the responses are strictly data-driven
Point out that the model's responses must be entirely based on the insights extracted from the data provided, as it seemed to rely on assumptions in the second question. Assert the difference between facts and presumptions.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
For the first example:
- The misunderstanding seems to stem from an interpretation of "more than" inclusive of the specified number, which is "5". The question asks for the amount of penguins that are "more than 5 years old". According to the given data, there are exactly 3 penguins that are more than 5. However, the model outputs "4", probably considering the penguin who is exactly "5 years old" to be part of the "more than" category.
- The prompt could make it more clear that the comparable terms, such as "more than", "less than", and "equal to", particularly in this case, "more than" explicitly excludes the exact number it is comparing to.

<2>
For the second example:
- The model seems to misunderstand the integration of the two different animal species tables. The question asks for the total amount of animals (penguins and giraffes) that are "more than 5 years old". According to the given data, there are 5 animals that are more than 5 years old. However, the model outputs "7", clearly combining all the entities older than 5 from both tables.
- The model doesn't seem to differentiate between the two tables and considers them as one big table, adding up the animals ages without understanding that they represent two different species: penguins and giraffes.
- The prompt could stress the importance of differentiating between different categories or species in a dataset and examining them individually, if required, before adding up the numbers.

Based on these issues, the following aspects could improve the prompt:
- Explicitly express that comparable terms like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to' exclude the exact numbers they are comparing to.
- Emphasize the understanding of individual categories within a complex dataset before combining data from each category.
- Specify more clearly how the updated dataset should be used. For instance, if separate tables for penguins and giraffes are provided, state that they represent different categories and should be analyzed as such to avoid mishandling data.
- Incorporate the importance of understanding the specific requirements of the question before proceeding with computations or calculations, as this seems to be an area the model struggles with.

In this particular example, the error in the model's response seems to arise from an issue around relational operator interpretation: despite the prompt's explicit mention, the model includes giraffes that are exactly 5 years old in its calculations, leading to an overestimate. In the dataset, the giraffe Jody is exactly 5 years old, but the question specifically asked for those 'more than' 5 years old, which should exclude Jody. 

Improvements needed:
1. Relational operator clarity: The prompt could further reinforce the importance of correctly interpreting relational operators, such as 'more than', 'less than', etc. Despite stating that 'more than' and 'less than' should exclude exact numbers, the model failed to uphold this rule.
2. Constant focus on data: The prompt could emphasize the critical role that paying constant attention to the dataset plays in drawing accurate conclusions.
3. Verification part: Models can make mistakes, so add instructions that also ask the model to verify the logical consistency of its interpretation in relation to the question asked.
4. Enhanced practice: The model may require more examples and specific practice focusing on operator clarity to fully understand the strict interpretation of these operators.

From these discussed points, improvements for prompts can be summarized as:
- Clear directions around the interpretation of relational operators,
- Continuous emphasis on checking back with the dataset,
- Steps for verifying the logical consistency of the interpretations before finalizing the responses,
- Exposure to more examples to help the model understand specific rules.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to thoroughly analyze the given dataset while diligently tracking all modifications, including deletions and additions. Make sure all revisions are validated and confirmed. Use the updated dataset to precisely interpret and answer each question. Direct your attention towards minute details within the questions, with a special emphasis on specified categories and relational operators such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and so on. Please note that operators like 'more than' and 'less than' exclude the exact numbers. Prior to providing your final response, revisit and authenticate all calculations and computations with the updated dataset. Ensure your interpretations and answers adhere strictly to the requirements of the question, leaving no room for error or ambiguity. Emphasize accuracy and precision in your responses, they should be solely based on the updated dataset with zero assumptions. Mistakes can be costly, hence double-check your calculations to avoid computational errors.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
How many giraffes are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is:

When responding to a query based on the updated data, be scrupulous about the rules, conditions, and categories stated in the question, including any specific sequences such as alphabetical or numerical orders. Pay close attention to the nuances between 'more than' or 'less than' (which are exclusive of the stated number) and 'equal to', making sure to treat these as separate conditions.

If the task involves multiple datasets, understand each dataset independently and consider contextually relevant information to the task. Stay mindful of specific keywords or phrases crucial for the task, such as 'sort', 'last', 'more than', 'less than' etc. Keep in mind that original sequences or positions may need reordering or additional processing for the correct response.

Discuss your logic to ensure you are excluding 'equal to' cases when the conditions specify 'more than' or 'less than'. If the task entails table modifications like deletions or additions, make sure to reason through these changes explicitly - removing or adding rows as needed and confirming that your final table reflects these modifications appropriately.

As you conclude, guarantee your final inference is derived from a comprehensive, meticulous interpretation of the task and your tracked data modifications. Justify your conclusions wherever possible to provide evidence of your understanding and applied logic. Treat each task as a unique problem set with no reliance on prior ones. Carefully follow each task instruction without assumptions or preconceived notions.
