In determining the connection between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment', which suggests that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, given all potential ambiguities and uncertainties. After careful examination, decide whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not, and provide a brief explanation for your decision. Conclude your response by indicating your choice, (A) for 'entailment' or (B) for 'non-entailment' and remember to render your response flexible when handling scenarios where sentence constructions are unexpected or confused.",

Understand that a detailed premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis and examine how one statement can imply another even if it is not explicitly stated or true in the objective sense.

With complex sentences, identify the function of each sub-clause and interpret their interrelationships. Always bear in mind that the concept of 'entailment' is determined by whether the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise beyond any similarity in the subject. 'Non-entailment' dawns when there's no logical implication between the premise and hypothesis, not merely a difference in subject matter. Having scrutinized these aspects, deduce whether the relationship between the premise and hypothesis connotes 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

            "prompt": "Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. However, one should not confuse a person's belief with the reality of another person's knowledge or certainty; belief does not guarantee confirmed knowledge. For complex sentences, recognize the main sub-clauses and comprehend the relationships between them. When determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment'. Remember, entailment implies that the information in the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise, taking into account any inherent ambiguities or uncertainties. Upon your careful analysis, come to a decision about whether the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a brief rationale for your choice. Indicate your decision between the provided options, for example,  (A) or (B).",

It is crucial to understand the distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. The term 'believes', for example, indicates that the proposition may not be a confirmed fact. To judge whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without full certainty (non-entailment), look for concrete evidence within the premise that can substantiate the hypothesis. Break down intricate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly comprehend their interconnections. Refrain from introducing external assumptions or possibilities not presented in the initial statements. Formulate your response strictly on the basis of the information in the premise and hypothesis, taking into account any inherent or implicit suggestions commonly associated with real-world contexts. Consider varying interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, exploring any indirect inferences or presumptions that could connect them. Ultimately, indicate your choice between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> tags, based on a critical evaluation of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis.",
