I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor suspects that David recognizes that a man wearing black pants and a helmet is riding a brown horse. Hypothesis: David recognizes that a man wearing black pants and a helmet is riding a brown horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B

Wrong Model Response: The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Correct Label: B
Model's Prediction: A.

Reasons for Wrong Answer: 
1. The prompt asks the language model to "Answer questions about causal attribution.". However, the given question does not specifically ask about the cause of an event but wants to assess the relationship between two statements. This inconsistency might have misled the model.
2. The complexity and multi-layer information embedded in both the premise and hypothesis can be challenging for the model to interpret under the guidance of the current prompt, which might be too general for such tasks.

Aspects That Can Improve The Prompt:
1. Make the prompt more task-specific: Instead of "Answer questions about causal attribution", a better prompt might be "Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses". This is more consistent with the given question.
2. Specify the nature of the task in the prompt: Including instructions about differentiating between ‘entailment’ & ‘non-entailment’ might help the model in making correct judgments.
3. Include guidelines for disentangling complex sentences: If the tasks often involve complex sentences like the current example, consider adding instructions in the prompt about identifying key sub-clauses and interpreting their relationships.
4. Emphasize the difference between suspect and recognize, as it's crucial to the correct understanding of the task. For instance, the prompt could include: "Note the difference in comprehension when the terms 'suspects' and 'recognizes' are used."

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment
Correct Answer: (A) entailment

Analysis: The prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" may have led the model to look for cause and effect relationships between events. However, the question being asked here is not about cause and effect, but about logical entailment between statements. The premise logically entails the hypothesis, which means option A is correct. However, the model might have been confused by the term "causal attribution" and therefore selected the wrong answer.

Improvement: 

1. The instruction should clarify the type of relation that needs to be identified. Rather than using the term "causal attribution," it could say "Identify the logical relationship in the given statements".

2. To avoid confusion, instructions could be given to focus on identifying if the information in the premise logically entails the information in the hypothesis.

3. Include more explicit guidance about how "entailment" or "non-entailment" is defined in the context of the task, potentially with examples or non-examples.

4. The model needs more accurate data examples of entailment so that it learns more effectively to correctly identify entailment. 

Based on these improvements, a possible improved prompt could be: "Examine the premise and hypothesis carefully to identify the logical relationship between them. Determine whether the information in the premise logically necessitates the conclusion in the hypothesis, selecting from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Make sure your answer fits with the definition of entailment: that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis must also be true. Remember to state the answer option in brackets."

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Step 1: Reviewing Question - The question essentially requires the model to deduce a logical connection between a premise and a hypothesis provided in the form of a sentence. It should infer that the details contained in the premise inherently contain the simpler information communicated in the hypothesis.

Step 2: Identifying Mistake - The model incorrectly determines that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. This is a procedure much more akin to logical reasoning than to identifying causal attribution.

Step 3: Root Cause of Mistake - The misunderstanding arises from the fact that the model seems unable to extract the implicit detail that a tennis player making a backhand swing would be holding a racket. While this would be clear to a human, the model's comprehension appears to be more literal, following only the direct pieces of information provided.

Step 4: Improving the Prompt - The prompt specifically asks the model to "answer questions about causal attribution" which may not align with the type of logical reasoning the question actually requires. It could be improved by specifying that the task involves deducing relationships between premises and hypotheses, keeping a focus on indirect or implied information. Additionally, the potential issues arising from not understanding human context could be addressed by specifically instructing the model to take any necessary logical leaps based on common knowledge.

Comprehensive Improvement Measures:
1. Specify clearly in the prompt that the task involves identifying relations between premises and hypotheses rather than "causal attribution".
2. Explicitly mention that the model should choose between "entailment" or "non-entailment" as defined by the context.
3. Guide the model to infer information implied by common knowledge thus going beyond mere literal comprehension. Specify this inference explicitly in the prompt. 
4. Perhaps include a few examples in the prompt on how to correctly solve such questions. This can help the model generalize the correct way of processing questions to a wider range of examples.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The source of error in the first example may be attributed to misinterpretation of the relationship between 'belief' and 'understanding' in the context of the premise and hypothesis. The model's explanation indicates that it's failing to consider that if "Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside", by default, Taylor should also believe "that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside" since he believes in William's understanding of it.

Example 2:
Here, the model seems to be overcomplicating the premise-hypothesis relationship. It took into consideration possibilities that were not presented in the premise or the hypothesis, such as Joseph’s mistaken recognition or John's changing thoughts. The prompt fails to provide guidance to the model to stick strictly to the given premise and hypothesis without introducing unwarranted assumptions. 

Examining these errors, here are some of the inadequacies in the prompt and how they could be improved:

1) Clarification on hierarchical relationships: The prompt needs to better guide the model in understanding the hierarchical relationship between 'belief', 'understand', 'recognize', and 'thinks'. Perhaps rephrasing the prompt to include additional instructions could help.

2) Directly relate premise and hypothesis: To avoid the introduction of extraneous assumptions, the prompt should guide the model to strictly interpret the hypothesis based on the information given in the premise itself, and not outside of it.

3) Precise assessment of certainty: The prompt can instruct the model to consider the degree of certainty implied by the terms used in the statements (like 'believes' and 'understands') and formulates its response based on these.

4) Not going beyond given information: The model must be instructed to not introduce possibilities not present in the statements to support the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. 

5) Explain entailment clearly: The model may need a clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' within the prompt to ensure that it’s making the right interpretations.

After addressing these issues, an improved version of the prompt might result in more accurate model responses.

The premise only mentions William's understanding, not Taylor's belief about the dog's actions.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph recognizes that John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp. Hypothesis: John thinks that skateboarder sliding down a ramp.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. The premise states that Joseph recognizes that John thinks that a skateboarder is sliding down a ramp, but it does not necessarily mean that John actually thinks that. There could be a possibility that Joseph is mistaken or that John's thoughts have changed. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:
The source of error in the first example may be attributed to misinterpretation of the relationship between 'belief' and 'understanding' in the context of the premise and hypothesis. The model's explanation indicates that it's failing to consider that if "Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside", by default, Taylor should also believe "that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside" since he believes in William's understanding of it.

Example 2:
Here, the model seems to be overcomplicating the premise-hypothesis relationship. It took into consideration possibilities that were not presented in the premise or the hypothesis, such as Joseph’s mistaken recognition or John's changing thoughts. The prompt fails to provide guidance to the model to stick strictly to the given premise and hypothesis without introducing unwarranted assumptions. 

Examining these errors, here are some of the inadequacies in the prompt and how they could be improved:

1) Clarification on hierarchical relationships: The prompt needs to better guide the model in understanding the hierarchical relationship between 'belief', 'understand', 'recognize', and 'thinks'. Perhaps rephrasing the prompt to include additional instructions could help.

2) Directly relate premise and hypothesis: To avoid the introduction of extraneous assumptions, the prompt should guide the model to strictly interpret the hypothesis based on the information given in the premise itself, and not outside of it.

3) Precise assessment of certainty: The prompt can instruct the model to consider the degree of certainty implied by the terms used in the statements (like 'believes' and 'understands') and formulates its response based on these.

4) Not going beyond given information: The model must be instructed to not introduce possibilities not present in the statements to support the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. 

5) Explain entailment clearly: The model may need a clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' within the prompt to ensure that it’s making the right interpretations.

After addressing these issues, an improved version of the prompt might result in more accurate model responses.

Example 1: 

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia suspects that a man dressed only in a towel is in a sauna. Hypothesis: Olivia suspects that a human not wearing any clothes is in a room.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

The model's response: The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. While the premise mentions Olivia suspecting a man dressed only in a towel in a sauna, the hypothesis talks about Olivia suspecting a human not wearing any clothes in a room. The terms "dressed only in a towel" and "not wearing any clothes" are not equivalent, leading to a non-entailment relationship.

Correct label: A
The model's prediction: B.

Analysis:
The mistake here stems from the model's overly stringent criteria for entailment. The model fails to grasp that a person 'dressed only in a towel' can be interpreted as 'not wearing any clothes,' given the specificity of clothing usually referred to in such a context. Also, 'a room' in the hypothesis is a more generalized version of 'a sauna' in the premise.

Prompt's shortcomings: 

1. The prompt does not clearly specify the meaning of 'entailment'. As a result, the model may interpret 'entailment' as requiring an exact match between the premise and the hypothesis, leading it to reject entailment in cases where a general pattern is consistent. 

2. The prompt does not instruct the model to consider how specific terms in the premise (like 'sauna') might fit into broader categories in the hypothesis (like 'room').

3. The prompt asks the model to focus on words indicating levels of certainty like 'suspects' and 'recognizes', but it does not address how to handle other kinds of semantic variations in the tasks, leading to the model prioritizing these words over the actual subject matter.

Improvements:

1. The prompt can be more explicit about the criteria for entailment. It could specify that entailment can still occur even if the hypothesis includes broader or more generalized terms than the premise.

2. The prompt could instruct the model to consider how specific sub-clauses from the premise might fit into more general categories from the hypothesis.

3. The prompt should instruct the model to assign appropriate weight to all parts of the premise and hypothesis, and not to overly prioritize certain terms. 

4. The prompt could ask the model to consider the context in which certain phrases are used for a more accurate understanding.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

The error in the first example stems from the model incorrectly assessing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. Despite the premise's specificity (i.e., a man is "jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open"), the hypothesis that 'a man is jumping' is sufficiently entailed, as the more detailed activities described in the premise are certainly a form of jumping. 

Wrong Example 2:

In this case, the error originates from an overly literal interpretation of the wording. The model seems not to fully understand meaning transmission through indirect speech. The premise, "William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread", does imply that "William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread". However, the model treated the premise and hypothesis as two separate ideas that are not connected, which led to the wrong conclusion.

Different reasons lead to wrong answers:

1. Misinterpretation of entailment: In the first example, the model seems to mistake the concept of entailment as requiring exact symmetry between a premise and hypothesis. However, entailment can also occur when a more general statement is contained within a more specific one. 

2. Literal understanding of indirect speech: The model doesn’t seem to fully grasp the concept of reported belief or cognition. 

Based on these reasons, the prompt can be improved in the following aspects:

1. Enhance the explanation of "entailment". Specify that entailment may exist between a specific description and a general statement, so long as the general statement is encompassed by the more detailed premise.
   
2. Include a clear explanation about indirect reported speech and belief, and instruct the model to be aware that the belief of one individual can be inferred from their knowledge about another person's beliefs.

3. Encourage the language model to pay attention not just to certainty-level words such as 'suspects' and 'recognizes', but also to consider context, the hierarchy of ideas, and the logical flow between sentences.

4. Offer alternative interpretations of sentences and promote a more flexible understanding of language nuances, rather than a strict, rigid interpretation.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment).

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment).

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle. Hypothesis: Charlotte suspects that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle. This can be broken down into two sub-clauses: Olivia knows and Charlotte suspects. The premise does not explicitly state that Charlotte actually believes that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle, only that Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects it. Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis that Charlotte suspects a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle.

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Premise: Charles understands that three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. Hypothesis: Charles understands that there are four people outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles understands that there are three young girls and a baby sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. The hypothesis is that Charles understands that there are four people outside. 

Breaking down the premise, we have:
- Charles understands that three young girls are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket.
- Charles understands that a baby is sitting in the grass on a blue blanket.
- Charles understands that there are baby toys scattered on the blue blanket.

Based on the premise alone, there is no explicit mention that Charles understands the total number of people outside. The premise only mentions the specific number of young girls and a baby. Therefore, the hypothesis that Charles understands there are four people outside is not necessarily implied by the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, the language model misunderstood the relationship indicated by the knowledge verbs. The prompt instructed the language model to focus on terms indicating levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. However, the model misinterpreted the implication of the verb 'knows'. In the premise "Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects that a furry dog is jumping over a hurdle", the verb 'knows' indicates a level of certainty about Charlotte's suspicion. Therefore, if Olivia knows that Charlotte suspects something, it does imply that Charlotte indeed has that suspicion. 

The language model instead misconstrued the command, treating 'knows' as adding an additional layer of uncertainty because the statement is from Olivia's perspective. This led the model to incorrectly choose (B) non-entailment instead of the correct (A) entailment.

<2> 
In the second example, the language model again struggled with the higher-level inference required for the premise and hypothesis's entailment. The prompt required the model to parse complex sentences and interpret the relationships accurately, which the model attempted to do but ultimately misconstrued its task.

The model took the instructions literally and strictly. It noted that the premise did not explicitly state the total number of people outside; hence, it concluded that Charles did not understand there were four people outside. However, the logical inference from the premise is that if Charles understands that there are three girls and a baby outside, then he would indeed understand there are four people outside. 

The language model's rigid interpretation of the prompt instructions led to it rejecting such higher-level logical inference and resulted in the wrong (B) non-entailment answer. The correct answer should be (A) entailment because the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.

Based on these two examples, the following aspects could improve the prompt:
1. Modify the prompt to clarify and emphasize how to handle knowledge verbs such as "knows." This would help prevent misinterpretations of the instructions.
2. The new prompt should guide the model to allow for logical implications, even if not explicitly stated. In essence, it should allow the model to make basic logical inferences inherent in the premise.
3. Include consideration of the context given in the sentence structure. The prompt should clarify that 'knows' or 'understands' does not add an additional layer of uncertainty.
4. The language model should be guided into understanding the conversational and relational implications of the premise. This will lead to better interpretation and entailment detection. 
5. The prompt should explicitly instruct the model that understanding a composite unit (like "three young girls and a baby") implies understanding the included components (four people).

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that "Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line." This implies that Abigail believes the tennis player is actively engaged in playing tennis. However, it does not necessarily mean that the tennis player is playing tennis, as the action of spiking the ball on the boundary line could potentially be part of a different activity or sport.

Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis that "Abigail assumes that the tennis player is playing tennis."

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise describes a scene in a gym where a woman player in white and black sends a volleyball over the net, while the opposing team in navy blue tries to block it, with the coach and spectators watching. The hypothesis states that Taylor suspects they are in a gym.

The premise mentions the specific location of a gym, which is where the action is taking place. Since Taylor is part of the group mentioned in the premise and is described as suspecting they are in a gym, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is: (A) entailment
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

In the first example, the model misinterprets the concept of entailment because it introduces the possibility that the tennis player spiking the ball on the boundary line could be part of a different activity or sport. This injects an external assumption not apparent in either the premise or the hypothesis. The premise talks about a "tennis player" doing an action in the context of tennis (spiking the ball on the boundary line), which, by default, affirms the player was in the act of playing tennis. Thus, the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis. The model's misinterpretation likely stems from the prompt's instruction not clearly indicating that the activities described in the premise should be taken at face value.

Example 2:

In the second example, the model misattributes information to the hypothesis that isn't given in the premise, leading to incorrect entailment judgment. While the premise describes a scene in a gym, the suspicion about the location being a "gym" is attributed to William, not Taylor (as stated in the hypothesis). The prompt fails to guide the model to recognise that the individuals and their assumptions, beliefs, etc. are integral to the content comprehension and cannot be interchanged. 

Improvements:

1. Revise the prompt to better highlight the necessity of taking the actions and activities described in the premise at face value, without introducing external possibilities or assumptions.

2. Reinforce the importance of the premise and hypothesis subjects (i.e., characters and their beliefs or assumptions) in the task. Introduce guidance that explains the invariability of individuals and their thoughts across the premise and hypothesis.

3. Keep explaining that they should strictly base their analysis on the provided premise and hypothesis, by not mixing or transferring information or attributes between different individuals or scenarios.

4. Add instructions to avoid generalization. The model should stick strictly to the individuals and scenarios presented, even when the premise and the hypothesis seem to contain similar elements or themes. 

5. Strengthen guidance on how to accurately interpret terms of uncertainty (like 'believes', 'thinks', etc.), and their implications for the entailment or non-entailment. 

6. Incorporate clearer directions about accurately identifying and comparing the main subjects (individuals) present in both the premise and the hypothesis, and maintaining their distinction throughout the analysis.

Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that "Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line." This implies that Abigail believes the tennis player is actively engaged in playing tennis. However, it does not necessarily mean that the tennis player is playing tennis, as the action of spiking the ball on the boundary line could potentially be part of a different activity or sport.

Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis that "Abigail assumes that the tennis player is playing tennis."

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The model's input is:
Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William suspects that a woman player in white and black, sends the volleyball over the net, while the opposing team in navy blue, tries to block it, as the coach and a few spectators watch, in a gym. Hypothesis: Taylor suspects that they are in a gym.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise describes a scene in a gym where a woman player in white and black sends a volleyball over the net, while the opposing team in navy blue tries to block it, with the coach and spectators watching. The hypothesis states that Taylor suspects they are in a gym.

The premise mentions the specific location of a gym, which is where the action is taking place. Since Taylor is part of the group mentioned in the premise and is described as suspecting they are in a gym, it can be inferred that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is: (A) entailment
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example 1:

In the first example, the model misinterprets the concept of entailment because it introduces the possibility that the tennis player spiking the ball on the boundary line could be part of a different activity or sport. This injects an external assumption not apparent in either the premise or the hypothesis. The premise talks about a "tennis player" doing an action in the context of tennis (spiking the ball on the boundary line), which, by default, affirms the player was in the act of playing tennis. Thus, the premise necessarily implies the hypothesis. The model's misinterpretation likely stems from the prompt's instruction not clearly indicating that the activities described in the premise should be taken at face value.

Example 2:

In the second example, the model misattributes information to the hypothesis that isn't given in the premise, leading to incorrect entailment judgment. While the premise describes a scene in a gym, the suspicion about the location being a "gym" is attributed to William, not Taylor (as stated in the hypothesis). The prompt fails to guide the model to recognise that the individuals and their assumptions, beliefs, etc. are integral to the content comprehension and cannot be interchanged. 

Improvements:

1. Revise the prompt to better highlight the necessity of taking the actions and activities described in the premise at face value, without introducing external possibilities or assumptions.

2. Reinforce the importance of the premise and hypothesis subjects (i.e., characters and their beliefs or assumptions) in the task. Introduce guidance that explains the invariability of individuals and their thoughts across the premise and hypothesis.

3. Keep explaining that they should strictly base their analysis on the provided premise and hypothesis, by not mixing or transferring information or attributes between different individuals or scenarios.

4. Add instructions to avoid generalization. The model should stick strictly to the individuals and scenarios presented, even when the premise and the hypothesis seem to contain similar elements or themes. 

5. Strengthen guidance on how to accurately interpret terms of uncertainty (like 'believes', 'thinks', etc.), and their implications for the entailment or non-entailment. 

6. Incorporate clearer directions about accurately identifying and comparing the main subjects (individuals) present in both the premise and the hypothesis, and maintaining their distinction throughout the analysis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution

At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment).

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom. Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that "William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom." This implies that William has a belief about the color of the broom being used by the man. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that "William believes that the man is sweeping dirt." This does not necessarily follow from the premise, as William's belief about the color of the broom does not guarantee his belief about what the man is sweeping. Therefore, the premise does not entail the truth of the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise describes Thomas recognizing specific details about two boys in a particular setting. However, it does not explicitly mention anything about the boys sitting at desks in a classroom. Therefore, the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis that Thomas recognizes two boys sitting in a classroom at their desks. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment.
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>  
The prompt provides clear instructions regulating the model to analyze the relationship between the premises and hypotheses. It also emphasizes focusing on terms that indicate levels of certainty. However, the problem in the first example arises when the model is asked to determine whether the premise "necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis". Despite the implication that "sweeping with a broom" would require some material to be swept, likely debris or dirt, the model was unable to infer this. Consequently, it misinterpreted the connection between sweeping with a broom and sweeping dirt, leading to the incorrect response. 

Reasons for the wrong answer: 
1. The model strictly adhered to literal interpretation, rather than considering the inherent assumptions in everyday contexts. For instance, the action of sweeping inherently suggests that there's something like dirt being swept.
2. It missed the semantic link between "sweeping with a broom" and "sweeping dirt". 

<2>  
In the second example, the model fails to infer from the premise that two boys being described would have to be in some space, which could surely be a classroom, even if it is not explicitly stated. Hence, the model incorrectly determined non-entailment due to the lack of explicit mention.

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1. The model didn't recognise the implicit suggestion in the premise that the two boys have to be located somewhere, which could very well be a classroom, leading to the possibility of entailment.
2. The model rigidly interpreted the prompt, and hence without explicit mention of the classroom in the premise, the model opted for non-entailment. 

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Add guidance about making necessary inferences based on what is usually true or likely in real-world contexts.
2. Include instructions highlighting the need to consider what's implicitly conveyed in the premise, even if not explicitly stated.
3. Consider directing the model to explore different interpretations of the premise and hypothesis, reflecting on any possible connections between them. 
4. Instruct the model to also look for implicit assumptions or indirect inferences that link the premise to the hypothesis when deciding between entailment and non-entailment.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt using a power saw. Hypothesis: Joseph believes that the guy in the sweatshirt uses the power saw.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using a power saw. The hypothesis suggests that Joseph believes that the guy in the sweatshirt is using the power saw. 

The premise does not explicitly mention Joseph's belief about the specific person in the sweatshirt using the power saw, only that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using it. Therefore, there is a possibility that Joseph believes someone else is using the power saw, not necessarily the man in the sweatshirt.

Therefore, the premise does not indisputably imply the truth of the hypothesis, leading to a non-entailment relationship between the two.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. This implies that James believes Richard comprehends the situation described.

The hypothesis states that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. This directly relates to what James believes Richard understands.

Therefore, the premise entails the truth of the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

1. The hypothesis: The model interpreted the language as though there could be multiple people, and Joseph could potentially believe that someone else, not the man in the sweatshirt, is using the power saw. But, the prompt usage of 'a man' and 'the guy' refer to the same person in this context.

2. Misinterpretation of 'believes': The model seems to have misunderstood the meaning of 'believes' in this context. If Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using a power saw, it is implied that he believes that the guy in the sweatshirt is doing the same action. 

3. Contextual Processing: The model may have failed to capture the true context of the sentence and looked for external suppositions.

Example 2:

1. Understand and believes are not equivalent: The phrase ‘thinks that Richard understands’ does not entail that ‘Richard understands.’ Richard could be misunderstanding or misinterpreting the situation for all James knows. But the model took James' belief as certainty.

2. Inaccurate understanding of entailment: The model failed to recognize that just because one person believes another person understands something, it doesn't necessarily mean that the second person truly understands the situation.

For Improvements:

1. Make clear: Ensure the prompt makes clear that the language model should analyze the meaning of words like 'believes' and 'understands' to reflect the uncertainty they introduce.

2. Emphasize Context: Encourage the model to focus on the context and take into account referential expressions within the premise and hypothesis.

3. Understanding of Indirect Inferences: Improve the instruction on how the model should treat indirect inferences or assumptions. 

4. Clarify entailment: Ensure the model comprehends that believing someone understands something doesn’t inherently mean that the person truly understands it.

5. Reduce Complexity: The prompt instructions are quite lengthy and complex, which could potentially lead to confusion. So, simplifying the instructions could be beneficial.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Evelyn assumes there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. This implies that Evelyn believes there are children present in the snowy environment engaging in some form of activity. 

The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Evelyn assumes children play in the snow in general, without specifying any particular activity. 

While the premise indicates a specific scenario where children are playing and one is making a snowball, the hypothesis is a more general statement about children playing in the snow. Therefore, the premise does not indisputably imply the truth of the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

Premise: Robert believes that Sophia recognizes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches. Hypothesis: Robert believes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Robert believes that Sophia recognizes a specific scenario involving a man in a blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera while another man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simplifies this scenario to just the action of the man in the blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera while being watched by another man in a blue shirt and baseball cap. 

The premise does not explicitly mention Robert's belief about the man in the blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera, but rather focuses on Sophia's recognition of the entire scenario. Therefore, the premise falls short of directly implying Robert's belief about the man in the blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera, leading to a non-entailment between the premise and hypothesis.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Firstly, two key reasons can be identified as to why the prompt leads to wrong answers:

1. The Complex Nature of Direct Implication: The prompt encourages the model to scrutinize the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis meticulously. While this is usually useful, the model seems to complicate simple relations in some cases. For example, in the first example, the premise directly implies the hypothesis, but the model argues that the specifics of the premise (i.e., one child playing in the snow and making a snowball) do not guarantee the general statement in the hypothesis (i.e. children play in the snow). 

2. Overemphasis on Individual Recognition: The prompt requests the model to focus on the terms that indicate degrees of certainty. But in the second example, this focus led the model to overemphasize the distinction between 'Sophia recognizes' and 'Robert believes', resulting in an incorrect prediction. The premise states that Robert believes what Sophia recognizes, which therefore also applies to Robert's beliefs, leading to entailment.

The current prompt could improve by addressing these points:

1. Simpler Implications: The prompt could guide the model to treat simpler direct implications straightforwardly without introducing unnecessary complexity. 

2. Consideration of Embedded Beliefs: The model should be guided to also consider embedded beliefs and recognitions. If a person believes what another person recognizes, this understanding should be extended to entail the first person's beliefs.

3. Degree of Certainty: While the prompt should direct attention to degrees of certainty and comprehension, it could be made clearer that these are not the only factors to consider. The overall context of the statements should be more emphasised to avoid focusing too narrowly on individual terms.

4. Handling Sub-clauses: The model's examination of sub-clauses seems to favour more granular analysis than necessary in some cases. The prompt could influence the model to assess whether splitting the statement into sub-clauses is benefiting the understanding of the premise-hypothesis relation. 

Considering these points, an improved version of the prompt might look like this:

"Analyze the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind terms indicating certainty like 'believes', 'identifies', etc. However, don't strictly limit your assessment to these terms. Understand the premise and hypothesis in their entire context, and consider whether the premise clearly implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it merely suggests that the hypothesis might be true (non-entailment). Avoid introducing external notions not contained in the initial statements and be sure to not ignore real-world implications. Finally, between the options (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment, choose the one that best reflects your assessment, and present this choice within <answer> and </answer> tags."

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert believes that Sophia recognizes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches. Hypothesis: Robert believes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Robert believes that Sophia recognizes a specific scenario involving a man in a blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera while another man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simplifies this scenario to just the action of the man in the blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera while being watched by another man in a blue shirt and baseball cap. 

The premise does not explicitly mention Robert's belief about the man in the blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera, but rather focuses on Sophia's recognition of the entire scenario. Therefore, the premise falls short of directly implying Robert's belief about the man in the blue shirt yelling and pointing off-camera, leading to a non-entailment between the premise and hypothesis.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Firstly, two key reasons can be identified as to why the prompt leads to wrong answers:

1. The Complex Nature of Direct Implication: The prompt encourages the model to scrutinize the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis meticulously. While this is usually useful, the model seems to complicate simple relations in some cases. For example, in the first example, the premise directly implies the hypothesis, but the model argues that the specifics of the premise (i.e., one child playing in the snow and making a snowball) do not guarantee the general statement in the hypothesis (i.e. children play in the snow). 

2. Overemphasis on Individual Recognition: The prompt requests the model to focus on the terms that indicate degrees of certainty. But in the second example, this focus led the model to overemphasize the distinction between 'Sophia recognizes' and 'Robert believes', resulting in an incorrect prediction. The premise states that Robert believes what Sophia recognizes, which therefore also applies to Robert's beliefs, leading to entailment.

The current prompt could improve by addressing these points:

1. Simpler Implications: The prompt could guide the model to treat simpler direct implications straightforwardly without introducing unnecessary complexity. 

2. Consideration of Embedded Beliefs: The model should be guided to also consider embedded beliefs and recognitions. If a person believes what another person recognizes, this understanding should be extended to entail the first person's beliefs.

3. Degree of Certainty: While the prompt should direct attention to degrees of certainty and comprehension, it could be made clearer that these are not the only factors to consider. The overall context of the statements should be more emphasised to avoid focusing too narrowly on individual terms.

4. Handling Sub-clauses: The model's examination of sub-clauses seems to favour more granular analysis than necessary in some cases. The prompt could influence the model to assess whether splitting the statement into sub-clauses is benefiting the understanding of the premise-hypothesis relation. 

Considering these points, an improved version of the prompt might look like this:

"Analyze the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, keeping in mind terms indicating certainty like 'believes', 'identifies', etc. However, don't strictly limit your assessment to these terms. Understand the premise and hypothesis in their entire context, and consider whether the premise clearly implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it merely suggests that the hypothesis might be true (non-entailment). Avoid introducing external notions not contained in the initial statements and be sure to not ignore real-world implications. Finally, between the options (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment, choose the one that best reflects your assessment, and present this choice within <answer> and </answer> tags."

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, conclude your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment.
(3) Scrutinize the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on terms that indicate degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. Decide whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it falls short of assuring the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Decompose elaborate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly understand their interrelations. Ensure not to present external suppositions or possibilities that are absent in the initial statements. Strictly base your response on the information purveyed in the premise and hypothesis without ignoring the inherent or implicit suggestions usually found in real-world contexts. Reflect on different interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, and explore any indirect inferences or assumptions that could link them. Finally, conclude your examination by indicating your selection between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. At the end, present your answer option within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert believes that Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees. Hypothesis: Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Robert believes that Thomas knows about a specific scenario involving a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flipping his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees. This implies that Robert has a certain level of confidence in Thomas being aware of this situation.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that Thomas knows about the same scenario described in the premise. This aligns with Robert's belief in Thomas's knowledge of the situation.

Therefore, the premise of Robert believing that Thomas knows about the specific scenario does entail the truth of the hypothesis that Thomas indeed knows about it. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Question: 
Premise: Robert believes that Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees. Hypothesis: Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

Wrong Answer: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>
Correct Answer: (B) non entailment

Step-by-Step Analysis: 
The premise is making a statement about Robert's belief about what Thomas knows. However, Robert's belief does not directly confirm the hypothesis that Thomas indeed knows the stated information. The model fails to properly differentiate between a belief and a proven fact. As a result, the assumption here is leading to the wrong conclusion. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:
1. The language model might be interpreting the verb 'believes' in the premise as a direct confirmation of the hypothesis, highlighting the ambiguity of the term.
2. The prompt could improve by emphasizing the need for concrete evidence in the premise for it to entail the hypothesis, rather than be based on beliefs or opinions.
3. The emphasis on specific terms like 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers' in the prompt might be leading the model to place undue weight on these terms and misinterpret their meaning in context.
4. The prompt might not be effective in directing the model's attention to the distinguishing factor between a belief and a verifiable fact.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. Specify the difference between beliefs/opinions and facts within the prompt.
2. Reinforce the necessity of concrete evidence in the premise for entailment of the hypothesis.
3. Refine the focus on the terms 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers' in the prompt to prevent overemphasis or misinterpretation.
4. Encourage critical analysis of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis.
5. Incorporate direction to test the validity of the belief or assumption stated in the premise before arriving at a conclusion.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles assumes that two women are tending to their herd of animals including cows and goats near a building made primarily of stone. Hypothesis: Charles assumes that the two women are taking care of a herd of animals.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles assumes two women are tending to their herd of animals, including cows and goats, near a building made primarily of stone. The hypothesis is that Charles assumes the two women are taking care of a herd of animals. 

The premise provides specific details about the women tending to animals, including the types of animals and the location near a stone building. However, it does not explicitly state that the women are taking care of the animals. It is possible that they are simply observing the animals or performing some other task. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example 1:

This example demonstrates the model's misinterpretation of indirect inference. The model correctly identifies that the hypothesis is not explicitly stated in the premise. However, the hypothesis is implied in the premise. If Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction, it's safe to infer that Michael also suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction. Here, the model might have been led astray by the nuance of indirect inference and how certainty can be inferred from suspecting someone knows something.

Wrong example 2:

Here, the model misinterprets the phrase "tending to their herd of animals" as potentially simply observing the animals or performing some other task, failing to recognize "tending" as implying care-giving. This might be because the prompt doesn't specify the requirement to consider synonyms or the context in which words are used when determining entailment or non-entailment.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Include instructions for the model to consider indirect inferences that could connect the premise and hypothesis, even when the hypothesis is not explicitly stated.

2. Encourage the model to consider contextual information surrounding key phrases or words which could impact their interpretation.

3. Instruct the model to consider the overall meaning of phrases rather than isolated words. For example, in the phrase "tending to their herd of animals," "tending to" could mean care-giving.

4. Ask the model to consider both explicit and implicit information when determining whether the premise supports the hypothesis.

5. Highlight the importance of synonyms and equivalent phrases when determining the relationship between premises and hypotheses. 

6. Specify that entailment is not just about literal matching of words or phrases, but about whether the overall meaning of the hypothesis is supported by the premise.

7. Finally, remind the model that degrees of certainty can also be indirectly inferred from the premise.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, conclude your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment.
(3) Scrutinize the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on terms that indicate degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. Decide whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it falls short of assuring the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Decompose elaborate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly understand their interrelations. Ensure not to present external suppositions or possibilities that are absent in the initial statements. Strictly base your response on the information purveyed in the premise and hypothesis without ignoring the inherent or implicit suggestions usually found in real-world contexts. Reflect on different interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, and explore any indirect inferences or assumptions that could link them. Finally, conclude your examination by indicating your selection between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. At the end, present your answer option within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(4) Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, focusing particularly on terms that indicate levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. It is crucial to understand the distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. The term 'believes', for example, indicates that the proposition may not be a confirmed fact. To judge whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without full certainty (non-entailment), look for concrete evidence within the premise that can substantiate the hypothesis. Break down intricate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly comprehend their interconnections. Refrain from introducing external assumptions or possibilities not presented in the initial statements.

Ultimately, indicate your choice between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> tags, based on a critical evaluation of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Determine the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, taking into consideration words and phrases that signify varying degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', 'assumes', and 'considers'. Recognize that 'beliefs' or 'opinions' do not unequivocally equate to 'facts'; for instance, 'believes' implies that the proposition may not be a firmly established truth. To discern whether the premise definitively entails the hypothesis or merely proposes it with some degree of uncertainty, examine the premise for solid evidence that can corroborate the hypothesis. Decompose complex sentences into singular sub-clauses and pursue a comprehensive understanding of their interrelationships. Avoid insinuating external hypotheses or possibilities not encapsulated within the original premise and hypothesis. Formulate your analysis solely on the data provided in the premise and the hypothesis, and do not neglect inherent or implicit implications that are typical in reality-based contexts. Take into account various interpretations for both the premise and the hypothesis, probing for any inferred or suggested links that may not be immediately apparent. Reflect on the overall contextual meaning of phrases, considering synonymous or equivalent terms and phrases in your analysis. Understand that degrees of certainty can also be implied and not only directly stated in the premise. After a judicious appraisal of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis, express your choice between the options such as (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by framing it between <answer> and </answer> tags. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard. Hypothesis: Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard. The hypothesis suggests that Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden. 

Based on the premise, it is clear that Robert believes there are three adults working in the garden near a fence. However, the hypothesis goes a step further and specifies that Robert suspects the three adults are outside in the garden. Since the premise does not explicitly mention the exact location of the adults within the garden, it is possible that they could be inside a greenhouse or another structure within the garden. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James understands that William suspects that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts. Hypothesis: William suspects that James understands that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James understands that William suspects a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts. The hypothesis suggests that William suspects that James understands the same scenario. 

Given that the premise explicitly mentions that James understands what William suspects, it logically follows that William suspects that James also understands the situation. Therefore, there is an entailment between the premise and hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

For example 1:

Step 1: The model correctly identifies the premise and hypothesis, which contain the term 'suspects' indicating a level of uncertainty.

Step 2: The model takes into account the premise that "Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard" and the hypothesis that "Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden".

Step 3: The model then incorrectly interprets the phrase "outside in the garden" as potentially implying that the adults could be inside a structure (like a greenhouse), whereas "in a garden" would typically be assumed to mean outdoors. This over-analysis leads to the wrong conclusion.

Step 4: Based on this flawed interpretation, the model selects non-entailment as the answer, whereas the hypothesis was actually entailed by the premise.

For example 2:

Step 1: The model identifies the premise and hypothesis and notes that they contain the terms 'understands' and 'suspects', again indicating levels of uncertainty.

Step 2: The model sees the premise as "James understands that William suspects that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts" and the hypothesis as "William suspects that James understands that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts".

Step 3: The model incorrectly interprets this information, assuming a reciprocity between William's suspicion and James's understanding, whereas the given information makes no assertion about what William suspects regarding James's understanding.

Step 4: Due to this flawed logic, the model concludes entailment where there was none, as the premise didn't provide concrete evidence to substantiate the hypothesis.

To improve the prompt:

1. Clarification and reinforcement of language: The model seems to be getting tripped up by over-analyzing the relations between sentences and the implications of certain words (like 'outside'). It could therefore be beneficial to emphasize simplicity and common-sense logic in the prompt.

2. Avoidance of over-assumption: The prompt could remind the model to avoid making presumptions that aren't substantiated by the premise or hypothesis.

3. Explicit emphasis on fact-checking: While the prompt already asks for concrete evidence, it could be clearer about the need to verify all assumptions based on the given premise and hypothesis.

4. Strengthen understanding of words such as 'believes', 'understands', 'comprehends', 'identifies', etc., and the levels of certainty attached to them. This may help reduce instances where the model assumes entailment based on loosely connected premises and hypotheses.

5. Lastly, the prompt could remind the model to adhere strictly to the given statements and not introduce plausible but unsupported inferences.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, focusing particularly on terms that indicate levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. It is crucial to understand the distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. The term 'believes', for example, indicates that the proposition may not be a confirmed fact. To judge whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without full certainty (non-entailment), look for concrete evidence within the premise that can substantiate the hypothesis. Break down intricate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly comprehend their interconnections. Refrain from introducing external assumptions or possibilities not presented in the initial statements. Formulate your response strictly on the basis of the information in the premise and hypothesis, taking into account any inherent or implicit suggestions commonly associated with real-world contexts. Consider varying interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, exploring any indirect inferences or presumptions that could connect them. Ultimately, indicate your choice between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> tags, based on a critical evaluation of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard. Hypothesis: Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard. The hypothesis suggests that Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden. 

Based on the premise, it is clear that Robert believes there are three adults working in the garden near a fence. However, the hypothesis goes a step further and specifies that Robert suspects the three adults are outside in the garden. Since the premise does not explicitly mention the exact location of the adults within the garden, it is possible that they could be inside a greenhouse or another structure within the garden. Therefore, the hypothesis is not necessarily entailed by the premise.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, conclude your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment.
(3) Scrutinize the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on terms that indicate degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. Decide whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it falls short of assuring the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Decompose elaborate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly understand their interrelations. Ensure not to present external suppositions or possibilities that are absent in the initial statements. Strictly base your response on the information purveyed in the premise and hypothesis without ignoring the inherent or implicit suggestions usually found in real-world contexts. Reflect on different interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, and explore any indirect inferences or assumptions that could link them. Finally, conclude your examination by indicating your selection between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. At the end, present your answer option within <answer> and </answer> tags.

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1>:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. 
Hypothesis: Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

Model's Response: The premise does not explicitly state that Olivia knows whether a car door has been shut or not. It only mentions that people are checking out a car with all its doors open. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily imply that Olivia knows whether a car door has been shut or not. This indicates a non-entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis.
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: B"

The model’s response indicates it interpreted the premise and hypothesis literally and factually. The model's interpretation focused on the explicit statement that people are checking a car with all its doors open, and it did not infer that if all doors are open, it implies a door has not been shut. The model, therefore, misinterprets the inference and opts for a non-entailment relationship instead of the correct entailment relationship.

Based on the reasons listed above, here are some improvements suggested for the prompt:

1. Highlight Inference: The prompt can be improved by emphasizing the need to infer and interpret the meaning of the premise and hypothesis, not just literally and explicitly, but also implicitly, taking into account common knowledge and logical conclusions. 

2. Emphasize on General Knowledge: To make logical inferences, general knowledge or ‘common sense’ is often required in addition to the given information in the premises and hypotheses. The prompt could be improved by instructing the model to use it when necessary.

3. Refine Understanding of ‘Confirmation’: It would be also beneficial to refine the model's understanding of 'confirmation'. In this task, 'confirmation' should be interpreted in a broader sense, meaning if a certain condition logically leads to another, it is considered as 'confirmation', even if it is not explicitly stated.

4. Distinguish Between Levels of Certainty: The model needs to pay keen attention to the verbs indicating different certainty levels. For instance, 'believes', 'knows', 'thinks'. It should be able to understand that 'knows' indicates a high level of certainty, implying that the information could be considered as 'fact'. 

5. Reinforce the Logic in Understanding Statements: The prompt needs to re-emphasize the understanding of logical and causal relationships between different parts of the statement. This will improve its judgment in identifying whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis or not.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1>:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. 
Hypothesis: Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

Model's Response: The premise does not explicitly state that Olivia knows whether a car door has been shut or not. It only mentions that people are checking out a car with all its doors open. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily imply that Olivia knows whether a car door has been shut or not. This indicates a non-entailment relationship between the premise and hypothesis.
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: B"

The model’s response indicates it interpreted the premise and hypothesis literally and factually. The model's interpretation focused on the explicit statement that people are checking a car with all its doors open, and it did not infer that if all doors are open, it implies a door has not been shut. The model, therefore, misinterprets the inference and opts for a non-entailment relationship instead of the correct entailment relationship.

Based on the reasons listed above, here are some improvements suggested for the prompt:

1. Highlight Inference: The prompt can be improved by emphasizing the need to infer and interpret the meaning of the premise and hypothesis, not just literally and explicitly, but also implicitly, taking into account common knowledge and logical conclusions. 

2. Emphasize on General Knowledge: To make logical inferences, general knowledge or ‘common sense’ is often required in addition to the given information in the premises and hypotheses. The prompt could be improved by instructing the model to use it when necessary.

3. Refine Understanding of ‘Confirmation’: It would be also beneficial to refine the model's understanding of 'confirmation'. In this task, 'confirmation' should be interpreted in a broader sense, meaning if a certain condition logically leads to another, it is considered as 'confirmation', even if it is not explicitly stated.

4. Distinguish Between Levels of Certainty: The model needs to pay keen attention to the verbs indicating different certainty levels. For instance, 'believes', 'knows', 'thinks'. It should be able to understand that 'knows' indicates a high level of certainty, implying that the information could be considered as 'fact'. 

5. Reinforce the Logic in Understanding Statements: The prompt needs to re-emphasize the understanding of logical and causal relationships between different parts of the statement. This will improve its judgment in identifying whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis or not.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, conclude your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment.
(3) Scrutinize the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on terms that indicate degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. Decide whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it falls short of assuring the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Decompose elaborate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly understand their interrelations. Ensure not to present external suppositions or possibilities that are absent in the initial statements. Strictly base your response on the information purveyed in the premise and hypothesis without ignoring the inherent or implicit suggestions usually found in real-world contexts. Reflect on different interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, and explore any indirect inferences or assumptions that could link them. Finally, conclude your examination by indicating your selection between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. At the end, present your answer option within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(4) Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, focusing particularly on terms that indicate levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. It is crucial to understand the distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. The term 'believes', for example, indicates that the proposition may not be a confirmed fact. To judge whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without full certainty (non-entailment), look for concrete evidence within the premise that can substantiate the hypothesis. Break down intricate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly comprehend their interconnections. Refrain from introducing external assumptions or possibilities not presented in the initial statements. Formulate your response strictly on the basis of the information in the premise and hypothesis, taking into account any inherent or implicit suggestions commonly associated with real-world contexts. Consider varying interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, exploring any indirect inferences or presumptions that could connect them. Ultimately, indicate your choice between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> tags, based on a critical evaluation of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis.

<START> Examine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, underlining terms that express levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'knows'. Make a clear distinction between 'beliefs' and 'facts'. For example, the term 'believes', could suggest uncertainty, whereas 'knows' indicates a high level of certainty or fact. To evaluate whether the premise expressly implies the certainty of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without total assurance (non-entailment), seek compelling evidence within the premise that can validate the hypothesis. Decompose complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and scrutinize their relationships. Avoid making external assumptions or speculations not mentioned in the original statements. Construct your response exclusively based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, acknowledging any inherent or implied indications that align with common real-world understandings. Contemplate various interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, investigating any potential indirect conclusions or preconceptions that could link them. Remember to use 'common sense' or general knowledge when required to make logical inferences. Acknowledge that 'confirmation' should be interpreted flexibly; if a condition logically implies another, it is considered as 'confirmation'. Finally, specify your selection between the given choices: (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment, by enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> tags, derived from a meticulous evaluation of the verbs and their semantic inferences within the premise and hypothesis. <END>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. Hypothesis: Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not conclusively imply the truth of the hypothesis. Just because Olivia knows that people are checking out a car with all its doors open does not necessarily mean she knows that a car door has not been shut. It is possible that she is aware of the situation but does not have specific knowledge about the status of the car door. Therefore, this is a case of non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard. Hypothesis: Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not conclusively imply the truth of the hypothesis. While Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard, it does not necessarily mean that he suspects they are outside in the garden. It is possible that the garden is indoors or partially covered. Therefore, the connection between the premise and hypothesis is a non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the first example, where the premise is "Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city" and the hypothesis is "Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut", the model has underestimated the implicit knowledge embedded within the premise. It failed to draw the inference that if all doors are open, then necessarily at least one door has not been shut. The model appears to have over-emphasized the part of the prompt about avoiding external assumptions and might have disregarded this clear logical implication.

<2> 
In the second example, the premise is "Robert suspects that three adults are working in a garden near a fence in the yard" and the hypothesis is "Robert suspects that the three adults are outside in the garden". The model failed to understand that being in a garden near a fence in the yard is an instance of being outside. This indicates that the model struggled to analyze the real-world implications of the premise. 

Improvements to the prompt:
1. Clarify what external assumptions mean - Statements that are not directly given or logically derived from the premise are considered external. Inferences that can be derived from the premise should not be considered as external assumptions.
2. Emphasize understanding of the real-world context - Encourage the model to consider logical implications that are naturally embedded within premises, such as indoor/outdoor conditions, open/closed states, etc.
3. Guidance on the handling of verbs - The prompt could include more guidance on how to interpret verbs such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers'. While they do signify varying degrees of certainty, the model needs to correctly interpret them in the context of the premise and hypothesis.
4. Building up Reasoning Skills - Enhance the model's ability to dissect complex sentences into smaller, comprehensible statements, and establish their relationships accurately.
5. Differentiation of Vocabulary - Ensure the model is able to distinguish between words and phrases that can subtly alter the meaning of sentences or contexts.
6. Scenario-specific instructions - While the current prompt does well to provide general instruction, the model might benefit from specific instructions that cater to different scenario-based entailment assessments. This could go a long way towards accurately evaluating entailment or non-entailment.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Sophia remembers that William assumes that the firemen and women wearing blue gloves have finished working on a person who is lying on ground bandaged and draped in a blue blanket. Hypothesis: William assumes that Sophia remembers that the firemen and women wearing blue gloves have finished working on a person who is lying on ground bandaged and draped in a blue blanket.

The model's response is:

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In this example, the language model incorrectly identified an 'entailment' where there was none. This indicates that the model is incorrectly interpreting the relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

Looking at the premise "Sophia remembers that William assumes that the firemen and women wearing blue gloves have finished working on a person who is lying on the ground bandaged and draped in a blue blanket," and the hypothesis "William assumes that Sophia remembers that the firemen and women wearing blue gloves have finished working on a person who is lying on the ground bandaged and draped in a blue blanket," there is a clear subversion of the order of understanding between the two individuals. The premise indicates that Sophia remembers William's assumption, but the hypothesis frames it as William assuming Sophia's memory. 

The model may have arrived at the incorrect decision due to the significant overlap in the scenario described in both sentences and not weighing the individual pivotal roles of Sophia and William in each sentence. This suggests that the model struggled to understand the intricacies of the roles that Sophia and William played in the premise and hypothesis. Therefore, it is evident that the model didn't comprehensively consider the words like 'remembers' and 'assumes', which were meant to indicate degrees of certainty.

Improvements:

To correct this, the prompt needs to place more emphasis on considering the activities of individual entities and their roles in an event when comparing premises and hypotheses. The prompt should ask the model to conduct a thorough examination of who is doing what, to whom, and for what purpose, in the premise and hypothesis to avoid interpreting the same situations differently. 

The prompt could be adjusted to explicitly mention that the hypothesis might alter or reverse the roles, actions, or beliefs of individuals or groups from the premise and that such changes would make the hypothesis a 'non-entailment'. The instructions need to clearly state that the positions and actions of individual entities in both the premise and hypothesis must remain consistent for an 'entailment'. 

Additionally, the prompt could be more explicit in asking the model to pay attention to trace the sequence of thoughts or assumptions made by individuals in the premise and hypothesis. The belief of one individual about another's assumption should not be taken as the latter's actual assumption, as done in the example. 

Finally, the instructions could use more emphasis on the importance of context in making decisions about entailment or non-entailment. The current prompt does mention context, but this could be extended to specify that changing contexts (like who is assuming or remembering something) can drastically change the interpretation of the premise and hypothesis. 

Overall, a specific focus on the roles and actions of individuals in the premise and hypotheses, consistency in their positions, careful attention to the sequence of thoughts or assumptions, and more emphasis on varying contexts can help improve the prompt.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, conclude your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment.
(3) Scrutinize the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on terms that indicate degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. Decide whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it falls short of assuring the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Decompose elaborate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly understand their interrelations. Ensure not to present external suppositions or possibilities that are absent in the initial statements. Strictly base your response on the information purveyed in the premise and hypothesis without ignoring the inherent or implicit suggestions usually found in real-world contexts. Reflect on different interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, and explore any indirect inferences or assumptions that could link them. Finally, conclude your examination by indicating your selection between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. At the end, present your answer option within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(4) Analyze the connection between the given premise and hypothesis. Consider words such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers' that signify varying degrees of certainty. Assess whether the premise conclusively implies the truth of the hypothesis, indicating an 'entailment', or if it does not fully guarantee the hypothesis, indicating a 'non-entailment'. Upon encountering complex sentences, dissect them into smaller statements and comprehend their relationships. Avoid introducing external assumptions that are not evidenced in the original statements. Make your decision strictly based on the premise and hypothesis, paying careful attention to implicit inferences that draw from real-world contexts. Consider the context and potential different interpretations of both the premise and hypothesis, identifying any subtle inferences or assumptions that may connect them. Conclude by stating your judgement as either (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Lastly, delineate your choice using <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. Remember, belief or presumption of understanding doesn't necessarily equate to the fact of understanding or certainty.

<START> Carefully analyze the bond between the provided premise and hypothesis. Pay special attention to verbs like 'believes', 'remembers', 'understands', 'identifies', 'assumes', and 'considers' that express differing levels of certainty. Evaluate if the premise incontrovertibly dictates the truth of the hypothesis, signaling an 'entailment', or if it fails to unequivocally assure the truth of the hypothesis, pointing to a 'non-entailment'. In the face of complicated sentences, break them down into manageable assertions and grasp their relative associations. Refrain from incorporating additional suppositions not backed by the evidence in the original declarations. Make your judgement stringently rooted in the context of the premise and hypothesis. Pay particular heed to implicit deductions that ensue from real-life contexts. Contemplate possible contrasting interpretations of both the premise and hypothesis, discover any delicate deductions or presuppositions that may potentially link them. Ensure to recognize the roles and actions of individual entities in both premise and hypothesis, and confirm that they remain consistent to establish an 'entailment'. Carefully trace the sequence of thoughts or assumptions made by entities in both premise and hypothesis. Always remember, a belief or presumption doesn't necessarily mean factual understanding or certainty. Conclude your analysis by signifying your decision as either (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Lastly, enclose your selected answer using <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. Also, consider the context as pivotal, remembering that altering contexts can significantly transform the interpretations of the statements. <END>

Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not conclusively imply the truth of the hypothesis. Just because William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread, it does not necessarily mean that William thinks the woman in an apron is looking for bread himself. Therefore, the connection between the premise and hypothesis is a non-entailment.

<1> 
Example: 
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.

The model's response: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>
The correct response: (B) non-entailment

This example is incorrect because the model interpreted "James thinks that Richard understands" as evidence that "Richard understands". However, James's belief does not constitute definitive proof that Richard understands. The dismissal of the cognitive verb "thinks" skewed the analysis towards a false "entailment". The model appears to have overlooked the directive in the prompt to pay attention to words like "believes", "understands", and "thinks", which signify varying degrees of certainty but not the fact.

<2> 
Example: 
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.

The model's response: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>
The correct response: (A) entailment

In this example, the model's mistake arises from a failure to properly dissect the complex sentences into smaller statements and comprehend their relationships. The model incorrectly assumed that because William's thought is about Michael's knowledge, it does not imply anything about William's own beliefs. However, if William thinks that Michael knows something, then it's implicit that William also thinks the same thing.

Example: 
Premise: Robert believes that Sophia recognizes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches.
Hypothesis: Robert believes that man in blue shirt yells and points off-camera while a man in a blue shirt and baseball cap watches.

The model's response: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>
The correct response: (A) entailment

In this case, the model appears to have misinterpreted the premise and hypothesis's relationship by undervaluing the implication of belief statements. When Robert believes that Sophia recognizes an event, it indirectly suggests that Robert also believes in that event.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clarify how to interpret cognitive verbs: The prompt should include more explicit instructions about cognitive verbs such as "thinks", "believes", "understands", indicating that these verbs, when used in a premise, do not necessarily substantiate an assumption in the hypothesis.

2. Expand on complex sentence dissection: The prompt should offer more guidance on handling complex sentences, specifically dealing with different levels of nested knowledge or belief.

3. Emphasize the importance of focus on the premise: Instructions should emphasize that the presence of a fact in the hypothesis does not confirm its presence in the premise. The model needs to carefully analyze the premise to ensure it contains all elements present in the hypothesis.

4. Expand on implications of belief statements: The prompt should underline understanding the potential implications of belief and thought statements, especially when they relate to what someone else knows or perceives. 

5. Provide examples: Including some examples of the process may help the model better understand the task. An example could be provided showcasing how cognitive verbs do not always confirm an entailment; another on how to handle complex sentences or belief statements properly.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the connection between the given premise and hypothesis. Consider words such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers' that signify varying degrees of certainty. Assess whether the premise conclusively implies the truth of the hypothesis, indicating an 'entailment', or if it does not fully guarantee the hypothesis, indicating a 'non-entailment'. Upon encountering complex sentences, dissect them into smaller statements and comprehend their relationships. Avoid introducing external assumptions that are not evidenced in the original statements. Make your decision strictly based on the premise and hypothesis, paying careful attention to implicit inferences that draw from real-world contexts. Consider the context and potential different interpretations of both the premise and hypothesis, identifying any subtle inferences or assumptions that may connect them. Conclude by stating your judgement as either (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Lastly, delineate your choice using <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. Remember, belief or presumption of understanding doesn't necessarily equate to the fact of understanding or certainty.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not conclusively imply the truth of the hypothesis. Just because William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread, it does not necessarily mean that William thinks the woman in an apron is looking for bread himself. Therefore, the connection between the premise and hypothesis is a non-entailment.

The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Example: 
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.

The model's response: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>
The correct response: (B) non-entailment

This example is incorrect because the model interpreted "James thinks that Richard understands" as evidence that "Richard understands". However, James's belief does not constitute definitive proof that Richard understands. The dismissal of the cognitive verb "thinks" skewed the analysis towards a false "entailment". The model appears to have overlooked the directive in the prompt to pay attention to words like "believes", "understands", and "thinks", which signify varying degrees of certainty but not the fact.

<2> 
Example: 
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.

The model's response: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>
The correct response: (A) entailment

In this example, the model's mistake arises from a failure to properly dissect the complex sentences into smaller statements and comprehend their relationships. The model incorrectly assumed that because William's thought is about Michael's knowledge, it does not imply anything about William's own beliefs. However, if William thinks that Michael knows something, then it's implicit that William also thinks the same thing.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, focusing on the terms that indicate levels of certainty like 'believes', 'understands', 'recognizes', and 'thinks'. Determine whether the premise necessarily implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Make sure to break down complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and interpret their relationships accurately. Be sure not to introduce external assumptions or possibilities not present in the original statements. Your response should be founded strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, conclude your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment.
(3) Scrutinize the relationship between the provided premise and hypothesis, emphasizing on terms that indicate degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. Decide whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment), or if it falls short of assuring the truth of the hypothesis (non-entailment). Decompose elaborate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly understand their interrelations. Ensure not to present external suppositions or possibilities that are absent in the initial statements. Strictly base your response on the information purveyed in the premise and hypothesis without ignoring the inherent or implicit suggestions usually found in real-world contexts. Reflect on different interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, and explore any indirect inferences or assumptions that could link them. Finally, conclude your examination by indicating your selection between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. At the end, present your answer option within <answer> and </answer> tags.
(4) Analyze the connection between the given premise and hypothesis. Consider words such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers' that signify varying degrees of certainty. Assess whether the premise conclusively implies the truth of the hypothesis, indicating an 'entailment', or if it does not fully guarantee the hypothesis, indicating a 'non-entailment'. Upon encountering complex sentences, dissect them into smaller statements and comprehend their relationships. Avoid introducing external assumptions that are not evidenced in the original statements.

Remember, belief or presumption of understanding doesn't necessarily equate to the fact of understanding or certainty.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Deeply investigate the connection between the provided premise and hypothesis. Pay close attention to verbs such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers' that suggest varying levels of certainty, but not affirm the factual truth. Assess if the premise irrefutably infers the truth of the hypothesis, indicating an 'entailment', or if it does not completely verify the hypothesis and therefore suggests a 'non-entailment'. When dealing with complex sentences, break them down into smaller statements, understand their interconnections, and analyze their relationship to the main premise and hypothesis. Prevent the introduction of outside assumptions not supported by the original sentences. Formulate your verdict strictly based on the premise and hypothesis, taking into consideration implicit references rooted in real-world circumstances. Reflect on the context and identify possible different interpretations of the premise and hypothesis. Recognize any indirect implications or assumptions that may connect them. Conclude by expressing your judgement as either (A)'entailment' or (B)'non-entailment'. Be sure to encapsulate your answer selection within <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. Note that believing or assuming to understand doesn't necessarily translate into understanding or certainty. Keep in mind that a belief about someone else's understanding or knowledge does not equate to the said person's actual understanding or knowledge, and the belief of someone about another's knowledge or understanding implicitly suggests they also hold the same belief. <END>

Question:
Premise: Richard believes that Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors. 
Hypothesis: Joseph knows that a man in a blue shirt touches his head while talking to two women outdoors.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Correct Label: B
Model's Prediction: A.

Analysis:

1. The model overlooked the nuance between belief and actual knowledge implied in the current prompt. It treated Richard's belief that Joseph knows something as equivalent to Joseph actually knowing it, which is not necessarily true. These terminologies ('believes' and 'knows') imbue different levels of certainty in the context and should be clarified in the prompt.

2. The model seemed to disregard that it needs to ascertain if the information presented in the hypothesis is entailed by the premise without ambiguities. It appears to have struggled with the abstract nature of the task, failing to differentiate between the concepts of belief, reported speech, and actual knowledge.

3. The prompt may have contributed to confusion of the levels of certainty denoted by 'suspects' and 'recognizes', as it did not differentiate between the certitude carried by 'believes' and 'knows'. This may have led the model to associate an equivalent level of certainty to 'believes' and 'knows', hence incorrectly summoning the entailment entailment outcome.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Stress that certainty implies different levels of surety: Highlight that 'believes' and 'knows' denote different levels of certainty. Belief does not imply actual, confirmed knowledge.

2. More focus on analytic capability: Emphasize that the model needs to infer the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis accurately. In this case, Richard's belief may not hold up against certainty, hence resulting in the hypothesis being possibly untrue.

3. Clarify concept of entailment: Entailment should be carefully explained, i.e., it is about whether the hypothesis necessarily follows the premise in all possible scenarios, considering any ambiguities or uncertainties.

4. Incorporate more examples: It may be useful to provide examples with explanations of why certain relationships are considered entailment or non-entailment to provide a practical understanding.

1. Stress that certainty implies different levels of surety: Highlight that 'believes' and 'knows' denote different levels of certainty. Belief does not imply actual, confirmed knowledge.

2. More focus on analytic capability: Emphasize that the model needs to infer the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis accurately. In this case, Richard's belief may not hold up against certainty, hence resulting in the hypothesis being possibly untrue.

3. Clarify concept of entailment: Entailment should be carefully explained, i.e., it is about whether the hypothesis necessarily follows the premise in all possible scenarios, considering any ambiguities or uncertainties.

4. Incorporate more examples: It may be useful to provide examples with explanations of why certain relationships are considered entailment or non-entailment to provide a practical understanding.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that terms like 'suspects' and 'recognizes' can denote different levels of certainty. Keep in mind that the relationship may be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In cases of reported speech or belief, understand that a person's belief can be inferred from the knowledge about another person's belief. With complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and understand their relationships to each other. Upon completion of your analysis, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a brief explanation for your chosen decision, indicating your choice between the provided options, such as (A) or (B).


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. However, one should not confuse a person's belief with the reality of another person's knowledge or certainty; belief does not guarantee confirmed knowledge. For complex sentences, recognize the main sub-clauses and comprehend the relationships between them. When determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment'. Remember, entailment implies that the information in the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise, taking into account any inherent ambiguities or uncertainties. Upon your careful analysis, come to a decision about whether the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a brief rationale for your choice.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that terms like 'suspects' and 'recognizes' can denote different levels of certainty. Keep in mind that the relationship may be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In cases of reported speech or belief, understand that a person's belief can be inferred from the knowledge about another person's belief.

Upon completion of your analysis, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a brief explanation for your chosen decision, indicating your choice between the provided options, such as (A) or (B).

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that terms like 'suspects' and 'recognizes' can denote different levels of certainty. Keep in mind that the relationship may be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In cases of reported speech or belief, understand that a person's belief can be inferred from the knowledge about another person's belief. With complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and understand their relationships to each other. Upon completion of your analysis, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a brief explanation for your chosen decision, indicating your choice between the provided options, such as (A) or (B).
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line does not necessarily mean that she assumes the tennis player is playing tennis. The assumption about the tennis player's actions does not necessarily imply an assumption about the tennis player's overall activity. 

Therefore, the answer is: <B> (B) non-entailment</B>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Robert believes that Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees. Hypothesis: Thomas knows that a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flips his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. Robert believes that Thomas knows a specific scenario involving a dark-skinned man in white shirts and a black sleeveless shirt flipping his skateboard on a cement surface surrounded by tall buildings and palm trees. Therefore, it follows that the hypothesis states that Thomas knows the same scenario. Thus, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. 

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> In Example 1, the prompt instructs the model to analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis and decide if it's an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment.' The explanation provided by the model shows that it's interpreting terms like "assumes" and "playing tennis" as not necessarily connected. This leads to the wrong decision. This could be due to the prompt not providing clear definitions of what constitutes an 'entailment'. The prompt suggests that entailment would be possible even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis, but the model may benefit from more specific guidance. Additionally, context sensitive words like 'assumes' and understanding the inherent entailment within it are not clearly touched upon.

<2> In Example 2, the model again seems to struggle with the concept of entailment versus non-entailment. In this case, the model has incorrectly identified the relationship as entailment, while the correct answer is non-entailment. This issue arises possibly due to the prompt not explicitly suggesting that believing in someone's knowledge does not necessarily entail the validity of the knowledge. Hence, the model does not correctly understand the difference between reported speech and accepted fact, leading to an incorrect entailment judgment. 

From these examples, we can conclude that the prompt needs improvement in the following areas:
- Clearer definition or examples of what qualifies as an 'entailment'. Proper boundaries and conditions can help the model make accurate decisions.
- Guidance on how to handle specific language nuances - terms like 'suspects', 'knows', 'believes', 'assumes' etc. must be elaborated or delineated in some way for the model to understand the context better.
- Guidance on hierarchical relationships and indirect relationships like one's belief about someone else's knowledge. The model should be guided to understand that a person's belief about another's knowledge does not necessarily confirm the validity of the knowledge itself.
- The model might be overfitting to the 'more specific' part and ignoring the 'even if' part which only increases the chances of entailment but does not confirm it. This phrasing might need rewording. 
- Differentiating between direct knowledge and reported knowledge could also be a point of improvement.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Evelyn assumes there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. This does not necessarily entail that Evelyn assumes children play in the snow in general. It is possible that Evelyn only assumes there are children playing in the snow in this specific instance. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
For this example, the model appears to have misunderstood the relationship between the specific and general context in the premise and hypothesis. The model correctly identified the premise, which is a specific instance of a general idea stated in the hypothesis - 'Evelyn assumes there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball.' However, it failed to correctly map this specific instance to the general context in the hypothesis - 'Evelyn assumes that children play in the snow'. Essentially, this specific premise entails the general hypothesis, but the model seems to interpret it in the opposite direction.
 
Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of context: The model incorrectly assumed that just because the premise stated a specific instance, it couldn't imply a general occurrence which is the hypothesis in this case. The interpretation of the context was not comprehensively undertaken.

2. Limited understanding of entailment: The model's understanding of 'entailment' seems to be limited. It failed to understand that a particular instance of children playing in the snow with one making a snowball could imply the general statement of Evelyn assuming children play in the snow.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clear definition of entailment: The prompt needs to clarify that entailment can occur from a specific to a general context, and not just from a general to a specific context. Provide examples to illustrate this point if necessary.

2. Context interpretation guidelines: Ensure that the prompt provides guidelines for comprehensive and holistic interpretation of context. It should not limit the model's understanding to a strict interpretation from general to specific contexts only.

3. Dual directionality: The prompt should emphasize that the relationships can be inferred in both directions - from specific to general contexts, and from general to specific contexts.

4. Sensitivity to Linguistic nuance: The prompt needs to guide the model to be more sensitive to linguistic nuances and subtleties that can indicate a relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

5. Example-based learning: Including examples may improve the ability of the language model to understand context, by having it learn from comparing and contrasting the examples provided.

For this example, the model appears to have misunderstood the relationship between the specific and general context in the premise and hypothesis. The model correctly identified the premise, which is a specific instance of a general idea stated in the hypothesis - 'Evelyn assumes there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball.' However, it failed to correctly map this specific instance to the general context in the hypothesis - 'Evelyn assumes that children play in the snow'. Essentially, this specific premise entails the general hypothesis, but the model seems to interpret it in the opposite direction.
 
Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of context: The model incorrectly assumed that just because the premise stated a specific instance, it couldn't imply a general occurrence which is the hypothesis in this case. The interpretation of the context was not comprehensively undertaken.

2. Limited understanding of entailment: The model's understanding of 'entailment' seems to be limited. It failed to understand that a particular instance of children playing in the snow with one making a snowball could imply the general statement of Evelyn assuming children play in the snow.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clear definition of entailment: The prompt needs to clarify that entailment can occur from a specific to a general context, and not just from a general to a specific context. Provide examples to illustrate this point if necessary.

2. Context interpretation guidelines: Ensure that the prompt provides guidelines for comprehensive and holistic interpretation of context. It should not limit the model's understanding to a strict interpretation from general to specific contexts only.

3. Dual directionality: The prompt should emphasize that the relationships can be inferred in both directions - from specific to general contexts, and from general to specific contexts.

4. Sensitivity to Linguistic nuance: The prompt needs to guide the model to be more sensitive to linguistic nuances and subtleties that can indicate a relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

5. Example-based learning: Including examples may improve the ability of the language model to understand context, by having it learn from comparing and contrasting the examples provided.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that terms like 'suspects' and 'recognizes' can denote different levels of certainty. Keep in mind that the relationship may be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In cases of reported speech or belief, understand that a person's belief can be inferred from the knowledge about another person's belief. With complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and understand their relationships to each other. Upon completion of your analysis, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a brief explanation for your chosen decision, indicating your choice between the provided options, such as (A) or (B).

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:

Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Hypothesis: Taylor believes that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside does not necessarily mean that Taylor believes a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside. Belief in someone else's understanding does not automatically translate to belief in the action itself. 

Therefore, the answer is: <b>(B) non-entailment</b>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Analysis:

In the prompt, the model misinterpreted the meaning of the premise and hypothesis. In the premise, "Taylor believes that William understands that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside", it is implied that Taylor also believes that "a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside" because they believe in William's understanding. If Taylor did not believe that a dog jumps to catch a red ball outside, they would not believe in William's understanding of the event.

This can be traced back to the misunderstanding of the concept of entailment in the prompt, wherein it might have been interpreted as requiring the premise to be more specific. However, entailment does not necessarily involve specificity. The model could have considered that entailment can exist between less specific or general ideas in the premise and hypothesis.

Furthermore, the emphasis on the distinction between belief and knowledge in the prompt may have confused the model as it tried to distinguish these terms in the premise and hypothesis. As a result, the model may have interpreted the premise as William's knowledge rather than Taylor's belief, leading to the wrong decision of non-entailment.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clearly define 'entailment' - It should be stated that entailment does not mean the premise needs to be more specific or detailed than the hypothesis. Instead, entailment means that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true, regardless of the level of detail.

2. Emphasize that belief can involve transfer - If person A believes in person B's understanding, it implies that person A believes in the concept person B understands.

3. Provide specific guidance on handling complex sentences - Provide more specific instructions on how to break down and analyze complex sentences, with special focus on understanding the relationships between different sub-clauses.

4. Adjust the emphasis on belief and knowledge - The explanation of belief and confirmed knowledge could be made clearer and more cautious, ensuring it does not confuse the model during the interpretation of the premise and hypothesis.

5. Guided process of resolution - The prompt should guide the model step by step to check whether the hypothesis is indeed a necessary consequence of the premise, and subsequently to decide whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using a power saw does not necessarily mean that he believes the guy in the sweatshirt is the one using the power saw.

1st Wrong Example:

Question: 
Premise: Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt using a power saw. 
Hypothesis: Joseph believes that the guy in the sweatshirt uses the power saw.

Model's Response: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. Just because Joseph believes that a man in a gray sweatshirt is using a power saw does not necessarily mean he believes the guy in the sweatshirt is the one using the power saw. There could be multiple people in gray sweatshirts using power saws in the scenario Joseph believes in.

Here, the model gets wrong as it unnecessarily introduces the possibility of multiple people in gray sweatshirts. The prompt does not direct the model to consider ambiguities that are beyond the presented facts in the premise and hypothesis. As a result, the model wrongly predicts non-entailment.

Other aspects for the wrong answer here may relate to the model's misunderstanding of the degrees of certainty related to 'believes'. The prompt provides an ambiguous direction regarding different degrees of certainty, which may cause misunderstanding.

Improvements:
1. Enhance the part explaining the degrees of certainty and provide clearer instructions regarding their handling. This can help the model to better understand how to deal with expressions of belief, knowledge, suspicion, and recognition.
   
2. Make sure that the prompt does not encourage the model to introduce new potential scenarios or ambiguities not present in the premises and the hypothesis.

3. Include instructions for the model to focus strictly on the information presented in the premise and hypothesis.

4. Make the explanation of 'entailment' more explicit, showing that if the hypothesis can be derived from the premise without adding extra information or scenarios, then it's an entailment.

5. Review the concept of 'non-entailment' in the prompt, ensure that these cases are identified when the hypothesis contains information or scenarios that cannot be derived or inferred directly from the premise.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. However, one should not confuse a person's belief with the reality of another person's knowledge or certainty; belief does not guarantee confirmed knowledge. For complex sentences, recognize the main sub-clauses and comprehend the relationships between them. When determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment'. Remember, entailment implies that the information in the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise, taking into account any inherent ambiguities or uncertainties. Upon your careful analysis, come to a decision about whether the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a brief rationale for your choice.

(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that terms like 'suspects' and 'recognizes' can denote different levels of certainty. Keep in mind that the relationship may be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In cases of reported speech or belief, understand that a person's belief can be inferred from the knowledge about another person's belief. With complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and understand their relationships to each other. Upon completion of your analysis, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a brief explanation for your chosen decision, indicating your choice between the provided options, such as (A) or (B).
(3) Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis.

Premise: Ava sees that Olivia thinks that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment. Hypothesis: Olivia thinks that Ava sees that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. The premise clearly states that Ava sees that Olivia thinks that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment. Therefore, it logically follows that Olivia thinks that Ava sees the same thing. Thus, the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise.

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. While the premise provides specific details about Thomas recognizing two boys in a particular setting, it does not necessarily entail that Thomas recognizes the two boys sitting in a classroom at their desks. The premise does not explicitly mention a classroom or desks, so the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. The premise describes a specific scenario where a man is jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open, which is different from the general assumption in the hypothesis that a man is jumping. The hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise as there could be various other actions or scenarios involving a man jumping. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. 

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1> 
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava sees that Olivia thinks that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment. Hypothesis: Olivia thinks that Ava sees that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment.

Explanation: In this question, the model confuses the directionality of the premise and hypothesis, and the results thereof, align incorrectly. The premise states that Ava observes what Olivia is thinking; however, the hypothesis asserts that Olivia presumes Ava's vision. These are not interchangeable because the hypothesized action (Olivia thinks Ava sees) is not an inevitability from the premise (Ava sees Olivia thinks). However, in the prompt, the model is instructed to consider entailment if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In this scenario, the model appears to perceive the premise as more detailed, leading to an incorrect conclusion of entailment. 

<2> 
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.

Explanation: This question presumably contains a typographical error in the premise where something is left out in the sentence, making the meaning challenging to decipher. The issue stems from ambiguity rather than the model's comprehension or the prompt's instruction. The prompt instructs the model to consider a specific scenario - analyzing the semantics and implications and evaluating whether the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise. Given the confusion in the premise, it means that premise does not specifically entail 'a classroom setting.' As a result, the model marks the answer as 'non-entailment,' when the correct action would be to interpret the premise based on more generous assumptions about what it intends to convey.

<3> 
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph assumes that man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping.

Explanation: The model's error here appears to stem from overemphasis on the premise's details. The prompt instructs the model to consider entailment even if the premise is more detailed than the hypothesis. However, it seems that the model misinterprets this as insisting on a strict match between the hypothesis and premise. In this case, while the man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open is indeed more specific, it does not change the overall action portrayed - that of a man jumping. Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis.

Improvements on the prompt:
1. Add reinforcement to correctly interpret scenarios where the direction of perception, knowledge, or assumption differs between the premise and the hypothesis.
2. Emphasize understanding overall contexts and actions over specific details, especially when the details in the premise should entail a broader scenario in the hypothesis.
3. Reinforce instructions to interpret entailment as a logical consequence of the premise beyond a strict match of the scenario.
4. Provide further clarity on the concept of entailment when assessing the relationship between hypotheses and premises.
5. Incorporate guidelines on handling situations where sentence structures or meanings are ambiguous or undefined.

Premise: Ava sees that Olivia thinks that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment. Hypothesis: Olivia thinks that Ava sees that a man stands with his arms out inside a large green piece of equipment.

Explanation: In this question, the model confuses the directionality of the premise and hypothesis, and the results thereof, align incorrectly. The premise states that Ava observes what Olivia is thinking; however, the hypothesis asserts that Olivia presumes Ava's vision. These are not interchangeable because the hypothesized action (Olivia thinks Ava sees) is not an inevitability from the premise (Ava sees Olivia thinks). However, in the prompt, the model is instructed to consider entailment if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In this scenario, the model appears to perceive the premise as more detailed, leading to an incorrect conclusion of entailment.

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.

Explanation: This question presumably contains a typographical error in the premise where something is left out in the sentence, making the meaning challenging to decipher. The issue stems from ambiguity rather than the model's comprehension or the prompt's instruction. The prompt instructs the model to consider a specific scenario - analyzing the semantics and implications and evaluating whether the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise. Given the confusion in the premise, it means that premise does not specifically entail 'a classroom setting.' As a result, the model marks the answer as 'non-entailment,' when the correct action would be to interpret the premise based on more generous assumptions about what it intends to convey.

<3> 
Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph assumes that man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open. Hypothesis: Joseph assumes that a man is jumping.

Explanation: The model's error here appears to stem from overemphasis on the premise's details. The prompt instructs the model to consider entailment even if the premise is more detailed than the hypothesis. However, it seems that the model misinterprets this as insisting on a strict match between the hypothesis and premise. In this case, while the man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open is indeed more specific, it does not change the overall action portrayed - that of a man jumping. Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis.

Improvements on the prompt:
1. Add reinforcement to correctly interpret scenarios where the direction of perception, knowledge, or assumption differs between the premise and the hypothesis.
2. Emphasize understanding overall contexts and actions over specific details, especially when the details in the premise should entail a broader scenario in the hypothesis.
3. Reinforce instructions to interpret entailment as a logical consequence of the premise beyond a strict match of the scenario.
4. Provide further clarity on the concept of entailment when assessing the relationship between hypotheses and premises.
5. Incorporate guidelines on handling situations where sentence structures or meanings are ambiguous or undefined.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Assess the relationship between premises and hypotheses, paying attention to terms that differentiate certainty levels like 'suspects' and 'recognizes'. Determine whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. For complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and interpret their relationships. At the end of your response, indicate your choice between the given options like (A) or (B).
(2) Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that terms like 'suspects' and 'recognizes' can denote different levels of certainty. Keep in mind that the relationship may be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. In cases of reported speech or belief, understand that a person's belief can be inferred from the knowledge about another person's belief. With complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and understand their relationships to each other. Upon completion of your analysis, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a brief explanation for your chosen decision, indicating your choice between the provided options, such as (A) or (B).
(3) Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. However, one should not confuse a person's belief with the reality of another person's knowledge or certainty; belief does not guarantee confirmed knowledge. For complex sentences, recognize the main sub-clauses and comprehend the relationships between them. When determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment'. Remember, entailment implies that the information in the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise, taking into account any inherent ambiguities or uncertainties. Upon your careful analysis, come to a decision about whether the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a brief rationale for your choice. Indicate your decision between the provided options, for example,  (A) or (B).


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

<START> 
In your analysis of the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, take careful note of the semantics and implications connected to terms like 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes', each representing varying degrees of certainty. Don't assume that because a premise is more detailed than its corresponding hypothesis, there is automatically an 'entailment' relationship. Furthermore, it's crucial not to confuse a person's belief, assumption, or perception with the reality of another person's understanding or certainty; such personal beliefs or perspectives do not guarantee confirmed knowledge for another person. When working with complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and consider their interrelationships. In determining the connection between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment', which suggests that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, given all potential ambiguities and uncertainties. After careful examination, decide whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not, and provide a brief explanation for your decision. Conclude your response by indicating your choice, (A) for 'entailment' or (B) for 'non-entailment' and remember to render your response flexible when handling scenarios where sentence constructions are unexpected or confused.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:

1. Insufficient emphasis on entailment in the context of belief: The prompt does not adequately stress that a statement can entail another statement within the context of someone's belief, even if the entailed statement is not explicitly stated or true. In the provided example, the hypothesis that "William believes that the man is sweeping dirt" is entailed in the premise "William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom". The actual truth of a man sweeping dirt is irrelevant here, because we are talking about William's belief. His belief that a man is sweeping with a broom entails that he believes the man is sweeping some substance, which could plausibly be dirt. But since the prompt doesn’t adequately emphasize the entailment in the subject of belief, the model makes an incorrect prediction.

2. Lack of clarity on the principle of entailment: Although the prompt tries to clarify that 'entailment' is determined by whether the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise, it could provide clearer specifics about situations where one statement logically implies another, such as in the example.

3. The prompt may over-emphasize the importance of variation in certainty conveyed by terms like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes'. While these can indeed indicate varying degrees of certainty, this focus can potentially make the model lose sight of the broader relationship between the premise and hypothesis when these terms aren't even used.

4. The prompt explains the concept of non-entailment as differences in subject matter, but lacks a clearer explanation about lack of logical implication or co-dependence, causing the model to make mistakes in scenarios where subjects are related but don’t logically entail each other.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Add a clearer explanation about the concept of entailment in the context of beliefs or thoughts. This can guide the language model to better understand that entailment can occur within situations involving belief or thought, separate from objective truth.
   
2. Clearly state that precise words or sub-clauses in the hypothesis need not be directly present in the premise for entailment to occur. Include examples where one statement logically implies another despite different word choice.

3. While maintaining the nuances of terms indicating certainty, ensure they are not overemphasized at the cost of neglecting the basic principle of entailment.

4. Clearly delineate the principle of non-entailment as more than just difference in subject matter but also lack of logical implication or co-dependence.

gradient:
The model may have made the wrong prediction in the example for various reasons.

1. Misunderstanding of Reported Belief: The prompt instructed the model to look at the nuances in reported speech or belief. In this instance, Emma assumes that William believes something. However, this reported belief does not automatically mean that William does believe it. The model may have misunderstood this concept, concluding that since Emma assumes it, it must be true. 

2. Confusion with Verbs of Certainty: The prompt mentions that verbs like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes' show varying degrees of certainty. However, the model failed to discern the implication of 'assumes', which suggests uncertainty or a lack of strong confirmation about William's beliefs. This indicates a gap in the model's understanding of these verbs of uncertainty and their impact on entailment.

3. Overemphasis on Similarity: The premise and hypothesis in the example seem quite similar, as they both talk about the same situation — runners in various athletic garments, including one individual in a spotted-green dragon costume. The model might have overly relied on this similarity, and did not comprehend the nuances of reported belief and assumption verbs, leading it to the wrong conclusion of entailment.

To improve the prompt:

1. Include Explicit Instructions: Make it explicit that reported speech or beliefs do not automatically indicate the truth or falsehood of the hypothesis. 

2. Distinguish Degrees of Certainty: Elaborate on how to interpret different verbs of certainty (like 'suspects', 'assumes', 'recognizes'). For instance, clarify the concept that 'assumes' doesn't validate the hypothesis.

3. Encourage Deeper Analysis: Encourage the model to look beyond surface-level similarities between the premise and hypothesis, and delve deeper into the semantics and implications of the situation. 

4. Use of Examples: You might include a few examples demonstrating what constitutes 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to give some concrete reference points for understanding.

<START> Unravel the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, being aware that expressions like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes' convey varying levels of certainty. 'Assumes', particularly, does not validate the hypothesis. Know that more details in a premise do not directly imply 'entailment' with the hypothesis. Plan to differentiate 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' basis whether the hypothesis inevitably follows the premise, not simply because they have similar topics. In scenarios with reported speech or belief, parse out the complexities: someone's belief about another person's information can be inferred, but that doesn't mean it is true. From the learned points, you should clearly decide if there is an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship between premise and hypothesis. You have to justify your decision succinctly, matching with one of the available options, such as (A) or (B). For example, if you conclude the relationship is 'non-entailment', your response should reason why and end with '(B) non-entailment'.

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Taylor knows that William suspects that a man with a gray beard and a little boy are sitting on the floor looking over some papers in a room with a bunk bed. Hypothesis: William suspects that a man with a gray beard and a little boy are sitting on the floor looking over some papers in a room with a bunk bed.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

Incorrect Answer: The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. While the premise states that Taylor knows that William suspects the described scenario, it does not necessarily mean that William actually suspects it. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be conclusively inferred from the premise. 
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Reasoning for incorrect answer: 

The model confuses the belief state mentioned in the premise 'suspects' with a factual state. As per the prompt's guidelines, phrases like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes' signify varying degrees of certainty, but they can still entail a corresponding belief state. In this question, the premise suggests Taylor's knowledge (a certainty) of William's suspicion (a degree of certainty). This necessarily entails that 'William suspects', as Taylor's knowledge doesn't affect William's suspicion. Hence, there is entailment, that doesn't necessarily imply the actual event happening, but the continuation of belief or suspicion by William. The prompt might be leading to the confusion by not explicitly clarifying that entailment can occur in these belief-based scenarios.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clearly specify that terms indicating belief states like 'believes,' 'knows,' 'suspects' etc., can still entail corresponding belief states in the hypothesis.
2. Clarify that the entailment pertains to the continuation of belief or suspicion (or similar states), not the actual event or factual event happening.
3. Encourage the model to weigh the specific words used in the premise and hypothesis, how they are used, and their implications in each particular scenario. The model should not make implicit assumptions about what certain phrases mean.
4. Better emphasize that the entailment is about whether the hypothesis can logically follow from the premise, not determined by real-world truth or falsity.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the given premise and hypothesis carefully. Determine the logical relationship, focusing on whether the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. Choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on this analysis and remember to place your choice in brackets.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the given premise and hypothesis carefully. Determine the logical relationship, focusing on whether the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. Choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on this analysis and remember to place your choice in brackets.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction. Hypothesis: Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
(B) non-entailment

<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong example analysis:

<1> This question involves the logical reasoning between "Michael suspects that Charles learns..." and "Michael suspects...". The correct answer should be (A) entailment because Michael's suspicion is the focus point, not Charles' learning. The model misunderstood the question and made an incorrect prediction because the current prompt instructions did not explicitly specify to factor in context or involve subordinate clauses in the analysis.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Lack of Contextual Analysis: The prompt doesn't underline the importance of the overall context when determining the logical relationship between the premise and hypothesis. The AI might have focused on "Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction" not equating to "eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction", without considering Michael's suspicion is the main clause.

2. Consideration of Subordinate Clauses: The prompt should clarify that subordination or dependence of clauses should be taken into account while analyzing. In this case, the misinterpretation might have occurred due to ignoring the dependent clause "that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction".

3. Complicated Sentence Structures: With complex sentences that include further subclauses, the model might get confused about the main points of analysis. A clearer instruction might be needed to guide the model to navigate through complex hypotheses and premises.

Improvements based on these reasons:

1. Emphasize Context: The prompt should explicitly ask the model to consider the overall context in the logical relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

2. Specify Multiple Clauses: The prompt should highlight that the relationship between multiple clauses within the premise and the hypothesis, regardless of them being independent or dependent, needs to be evaluated.

3. Handling Complex Structures: Provide instructions to the AI to be more careful when navigating through complex sentence structures. The prompt can ask the model to break down sentences into smaller parts and analyze each part's role before coming to a conclusion.

The revised prompt could be: Analyze the given premise and hypothesis in their entirety, including the context and subordination of clauses. Break down complicated sentence structures into manageable parts if necessary. Determine whether the premise logically leads to the hypothesis, and choose between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Be sure to place your choice in brackets at the end.

Premise: Richard learns that Isabella thinks that a man looks mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man looks mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert.
Options:
(A) entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not logically lead to the conclusion in the hypothesis because it only states that Richard learns about Isabella's opinion, but it does not necessarily mean that Isabella actually holds that opinion. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.
Therefore, the answer is: <(B) non-entailment>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
For example <1>, the mistake arises from the model's misinterpretation of the scenario. This particular scenario involves Richard learning Isabella's opinion, in which context, it directly states that Isabella believes something, hence it's an entailment rather than a non-entailment. However, the model seems to be questioning the validity of Richard’s knowledge about Isabella’s opinion, considering it as a third-party perspective, and hence marking it as a non-entailment. 

The issue appears to stem from the way the instruction is phrased in the prompt, which may be leading the model to overanalyze the situation or misunderstand the context. Here are some potential improvements to address this, avoid confusion and make it clearer for the model.

1. Specify in the prompt that third-party perspectives that state someone else's opinion or view can be considered valid and should not automatically lead to a non-entailment. 

2. Make it clearer that if, for instance, a premise states that person A learns or knows that person B believes something, this can still be an entailment, rather than a non-entailment.

3. Clarify that the task is to judge if the information in the premise exists in the hypothesis provided, not whether the information is necessarily true or valid.

4. Ask the model to focus on the literal translation of the premise and hypothesis instead of inferring meanings or questioning the validity of the statement.

5. Instruction in the prompt has to be unambiguous and simple, which will limit the chance of over-evaluation and misinterpretation of the premise and hypothesis by the model. 

By refining these aspects, the probability of incorrect evaluation by the model would substantially reduce.

The premise states that Charlotte remembers that David assumes that a man sits on his throne behind the drums. This does not necessarily mean that David actually assumes that a man sits on his throne behind the drums. It is possible that Charlotte is mistaken or misremembering. Therefore, the premise does not logically lead to the conclusion in the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the correct answer is: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

<1> 
This error seemingly stems from the model's misunderstanding of the premise and hypothesis being presented. There is a difference between the order of the information, however, the contents of the premise and the hypothesis are the same - a woman with a wood in her hand is standing with a smile on her face. It's just that they're phrased differently. Therefore, the model should have indicated (A) entailment but chose (B) non-entailment because of the misinterpretation of the information, which it presumably treated as different due to the different wording.

<2> 
In this case, the model's misunderstanding has to do with the theory of mind. The model failed to recognize that what James assumes Taylor assumes is not necessarily what James himself assumes. Instead, the model viewed the premise as inclusive of the hypothesis because the latter makes up part of the former's context. However, since what one person thinks another person thinks is not the same as what the first person thinks, the answer should have been (B) non-entailment.

<3> 
Here, the model failed in the same way it did in example 2. The model failed to recognize the difference between what Charlotte remembers David assuming and what David actually assumes. It chose (B) non-entailment, suggesting that the model merely perceived the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis without considering their precise meaning.

Improvements:
1. Add instructions to the prompt for the model to analyze the details of the phrasing in the premise and hypothesis, focusing on the nuances of the language used.
2. Place more emphasis on the hierarchical and simultaneous relationships of cognitive verbs like 'assumes,' 'thinks,' and 'remembers.' This could help the model better understand these complex relationships and the differences therein.
3. Include illustrations in the prompt that highlight the concept of the order or sequence of the information itself doesn't change the inherent meaning.
4. Include precise instructions in the prompt to ensure the model checks if the basic premise of the hypothesis is within the main premise given for 100% accuracy.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that John assumes that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. Hypothesis: James thinks that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James thinks that John assumes that a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simplifies this complex scenario to just the boy in the yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talking on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on.

The premise includes an additional layer of complexity with James thinking about John's assumption. However, the essential premise of the hypothesis, which is the boy in the yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talking on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on, is inherently within the main premise provided.

Therefore, the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis, making it an entailment.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Premise: Charles understands that three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. Hypothesis: Charles understands that there are four people outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles understands that there are three young girls and a baby sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. The hypothesis states that Charles understands that there are four people outside. 

The premise provides specific details about the individuals present outside, mentioning three young girls and a baby. However, it does not explicitly state the total number of people, as it does not specify whether the three young girls are separate individuals or part of a group. Therefore, the premise does not logically lead to the conclusion in the hypothesis that there are four people outside. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

In this example, the model makes a mistake by assuming that the cognitive relationship 'thinks' carries the same certainty as an objective statement. When the prompt asks the model to consider whether the essential premise of the hypothesis is inherently within the main premise provided, the model fails to account for the layer of uncertainty introduced by the cognitive verbs 'thinks' and 'assumes.' Even though the literal contents of the actions 'a boy in a yellow t-shirt and pink sweater talks on a cellphone while riding a horse through a crowd of people who are looking on' are identical in the hypothesis and the premise, the assumptions made in the premise do not directly equate to James' thoughts in the hypothesis, hence leading to a mistake of announcing this as entailment.

Example 2:

In the second example, the model gets distracted by the lack of explicit numerical count in the premise. While it is understandable that the number of people is not directly specified, the premise provides sufficient context clues (three young girls and a baby) to deduce that the actual number of people is equal to four. When the prompt instructs the model to examine the essential premise of the hypothesis in the main premise, the model errs in not considering an indirect or implicit reference as equivalent to a direct, explicit one, therefore failing to classify this as entailment.

Based on the analysis above, these aspects can be improved in the prompt:

1. Provide clear instructions for the model to not only focus on literal contents but also consider implicit meanings, contextual cues, and references.
2. Specify that the cognitive verbs such as 'assumes', 'thinks', 'remembers' introduce a layer of subjectivity and uncertainty. Hence, an assumption or thought in the premise does not directly ensure the certainty of the same in the hypothesis.
3. Ask the model to separately analyze each aspect of cognitive verbs, numerical counts, and implicit references to increase the accuracy of entailment or non-entailment decision.
4. Encourage the model to delve deeper into the implications of cognitive processes and subtleties of language to understand the nuanced relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise describes a scene in a gym where a woman player in white and black is playing volleyball against an opposing team in navy blue, with the coach and spectators watching. William is the one who suspects this situation. The hypothesis states that Taylor suspects they are in a gym.

The premise clearly states that the scene is taking place in a gym, so it logically follows that Taylor would suspect they are in a gym. Therefore, the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is: (A) entailment

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Ava believes that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. This implies that Olivia has a belief about the location of the dog. The hypothesis directly states that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. Given that the premise explicitly mentions Olivia's belief, it logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this example, the AI model incorrectly interpreted the premise and the hypothesis. The error is rooted in the misunderstanding of cognitive verbs such as 'suspects'. According to the premise, William suspects a specific scene taking place in a gym, not Taylor. The hypothesis, however, revolves around Taylor's suspicion, not William's. The distinction in subjects led to a non-entailment but was overlooked by the AI that focused on just the shared thematic element of being 'in a gym'.

<2> 
The model's error in this second example is also due to a misunderstanding of cognitive verbs and the relationship defined through them. Although the premise mentioned that '[John] believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse', it did not definitively assert Amelia's assumption, rather it narrated John's belief about Amelia's assumption. The narration of one person's belief about another's assumption does not conclusively confirm the assumption. Therefore, despite the hypothesis being directly derived from the premise, the difference in mental actions makes it non-entailment. The model was overly literal in its interpretation.

<3> 
The model made a similar error in the third example as the second. Even though the premise includes Ava's belief about Olivia's thoughts, which forms the basis of the hypothesis, the model failed to note that it is not a direct assertion of Olivia's thoughts, but rather a perspective from Ava. Direct assertions and beliefs depicted by another person cannot be equated as the same, leading to a non-entailment relationship. Yet, the model overlooked the intricacies of the cognitive verbs and their applied contexts.

From these examples, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. The prompt should suggest a more careful analysis of the cognitive verbs and their subjects. It should direct the model to pay closer attention to the characters involved and their mental actions.

2. The prompt should guide the model to understand that reporting of belief, thoughts, or assumptions by one character about another does not equivalent to a direct assertion made by the character themselves.

3. It should emphasize that the logical relationship being sought is strictly between the premise and hypothesis - not merely shared contexts or themes - to discount irrelevant similarities.

4. The model should be guided to be more aware of the subtleties and hierarchical nature of language and cognition. It should consider the potentials for misinterpretation when dealing with indirect evidences or beliefs. 

5. Lastly, the model should be prompted to analyze each sentence more carefully, considering the order of information, the use of language and subtleties in the context before determining the logical relationship.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William suspects that a woman player in white and black, sends the volleyball over the net, while the opposing team in navy blue, tries to block it, as the coach and a few spectators watch, in a gym. Hypothesis: Taylor suspects that they are in a gym.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise describes a scene in a gym where a woman player in white and black is playing volleyball against an opposing team in navy blue, with the coach and spectators watching. William is the one who suspects this situation. The hypothesis states that Taylor suspects they are in a gym.

The premise clearly states that the scene is taking place in a gym, so it logically follows that Taylor would suspect they are in a gym. Therefore, the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is: (A) entailment
<answer>(A)</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. Hypothesis: Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. This implies that John's belief is based on Amelia's assumption. The hypothesis directly states that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. Therefore, the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is (A) entailment.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. Hypothesis: Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Ava believes that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. This implies that Olivia has a belief about the location of the dog. The hypothesis directly states that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. Given that the premise explicitly mentions Olivia's belief, it logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is entailment.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this example, the AI model incorrectly interpreted the premise and the hypothesis. The error is rooted in the misunderstanding of cognitive verbs such as 'suspects'. According to the premise, William suspects a specific scene taking place in a gym, not Taylor. The hypothesis, however, revolves around Taylor's suspicion, not William's. The distinction in subjects led to a non-entailment but was overlooked by the AI that focused on just the shared thematic element of being 'in a gym'.

<2> 
The model's error in this second example is also due to a misunderstanding of cognitive verbs and the relationship defined through them. Although the premise mentioned that '[John] believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse', it did not definitively assert Amelia's assumption, rather it narrated John's belief about Amelia's assumption. The narration of one person's belief about another's assumption does not conclusively confirm the assumption. Therefore, despite the hypothesis being directly derived from the premise, the difference in mental actions makes it non-entailment. The model was overly literal in its interpretation.

<3> 
The model made a similar error in the third example as the second. Even though the premise includes Ava's belief about Olivia's thoughts, which forms the basis of the hypothesis, the model failed to note that it is not a direct assertion of Olivia's thoughts, but rather a perspective from Ava. Direct assertions and beliefs depicted by another person cannot be equated as the same, leading to a non-entailment relationship. Yet, the model overlooked the intricacies of the cognitive verbs and their applied contexts.

From these examples, the following improvements can be made to the prompt:

1. The prompt should suggest a more careful analysis of the cognitive verbs and their subjects. It should direct the model to pay closer attention to the characters involved and their mental actions.

2. The prompt should guide the model to understand that reporting of belief, thoughts, or assumptions by one character about another does not equivalent to a direct assertion made by the character themselves.

3. It should emphasize that the logical relationship being sought is strictly between the premise and hypothesis - not merely shared contexts or themes - to discount irrelevant similarities.

4. The model should be guided to be more aware of the subtleties and hierarchical nature of language and cognition. It should consider the potentials for misinterpretation when dealing with indirect evidences or beliefs. 

5. Lastly, the model should be prompted to analyze each sentence more carefully, considering the order of information, the use of language and subtleties in the context before determining the logical relationship.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas assumes that Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium. Hypothesis: Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Thomas assumes that Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium. This implies that Thomas is attributing a belief to Robert about the location of the women's volleyball team. The hypothesis directly states that Robert believes that a women's volleyball team plays in a brown and green gymnasium. Given the premise, it can be inferred that Robert indeed holds this belief as Thomas assumes it to be true. Therefore, the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is: (A) entailment
<answer>(A)</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining the provided example, the incorrect response from the AI can be involved with the following reasons:

1) Misinterpretation of cognitive roles: 
The model is not accurately interpreting the intended cognitive roles specified in the premise and the hypothesis. It's interpreting Thomas's assumption of Robert's belief as Robert's actual belief, which isn't necessarily accurate. The hypothesis is making a statement about Robert's belief, while the premise is making a statement about Thomas's assumption - the fact could be otherwise unbeknownst to Thomas, therefore they are not identical. 

2) Misunderstanding the definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment': 
The task requires determining if the premise logically leads to the conclusion in the hypothesis. An 'entailment' would mean the hypothesis is a guaranteed outcome of the premise. The model seems to consider the possibility of the approximation of the contents in the premise and the hypothesis as an entailment, without acknowledging that hypothesis could still be false even if the premise were true. This reveals its misunderstanding or overlooking the strictness of the definition of entailment.

Aspects that can improve the prompt based on these reasons might include:

1) Clear delineation of the cognitive roles: The new prompt could more explicitly define what is meant by 'assumes', 'thinks', and 'remembers'. By ensuring the AI understands these cognitive verbs and their hierarchical relationships, it can better analyze the premise and hypothesis.

2) Elaboration on entailment definition: The prompt should stress that 'entailment' means the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis. This may help the model understand that an 'entailment' relationship requires that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true.

3) Emphasize the order of information: The model should understand that changing the order of statements can change their meanings and consequences, and doesn't necessarily imply an entailment. The prompt could explicitly instruct the model to consider whether changing the order could affect the interpretation.

In summary, the improved prompt could emphasize a better understanding of cognitive verbs, clarify the strict definition of entailment and non-entailment, and instruct the model to consider the order and hierarchy of the information presented.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, focusing particularly on terms that indicate levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. It is crucial to understand the distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. The term 'believes', for example, indicates that the proposition may not be a confirmed fact. To judge whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without full certainty (non-entailment), look for concrete evidence within the premise that can substantiate the hypothesis. Break down intricate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly comprehend their interconnections. Refrain from introducing external assumptions or possibilities not presented in the initial statements. Formulate your response strictly on the basis of the information in the premise and hypothesis, taking into account any inherent or implicit suggestions commonly associated with real-world contexts.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis by paying close attention to certain language cues that indicate uncertainty, such as 'suspects', 'believes', 'understands', and 'considers'. Keep in mind the significant distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. For instance, when someone 'believes' something, it implies that the information might not be a validated truth. You must determine if the hypothesis follows undoubtedly from the premise (entailment), or if the premise leaves room for alternative outcomes (non-entailment). To certify this, look for explicit evidence in the premise supporting the hypothesis. Be sure to methodically breakdown complex sentences into their fundamental sub-phrases and interpret their interrelations accurately, with no undue assumptions or inferences. Keep your analysis strictly rooted in the premise and hypothesis, without introducing extraneous conjectures not indicated in the statements. Whilst taking into account general world knowledge and common interpretations, avoid over-complicating commonplace phrases or terms. Also, explore varying interpretations for the premise and hypothesis, but remember not to infer connections that are not clearly indicated in the text. Conclude your analysis by indicating your determination between the options of (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Please insert your chosen response within the <answer> and </answer> tags. Remember, your goal is to make an accurate, sensible judgement based on given information, without introducing plausible but unsupported elaborations.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. However, one should not confuse a person's belief with the reality of another person's knowledge or certainty; belief does not guarantee confirmed knowledge. For complex sentences, recognize the main sub-clauses and comprehend the relationships between them. When determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment'. Remember, entailment implies that the information in the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise, taking into account any inherent ambiguities or uncertainties. Upon your careful analysis, come to a decision about whether the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a brief rationale for your choice. Indicate your decision between the provided options, for example,  (A) or (B).

   prompt: Accurately analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, taking into account the semantics of terms like 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes'. Understand that these words reflect various degrees of certainty. Acknowledge that an 'entailment' relationship can exist even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. Importantly, do not conflate a person's belief with the actual knowledge or certainty of another; belief doesn't assure an absolute truth. In the case of compound sentences, identify main clauses and grasp the relations amongst them. While assessing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, concentrate on the concept of 'entailment', that is, the hypothesis is necessarily inferred from the premise, without adding or implying external scenarios or facts. After thoughtful analysis, decide whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and briefly explain the reasoning behind your choice. Signify your chosen response by using the provided options such as  (A) or (B). For 'non-entailment', ensure this applies only when the hypothesis introduces elements that are not directly deducible from the premise.

   prompt: Investigate the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, understanding that phrases like 'suspects', 'assumes' and 'recognizes' reveal varying degrees of certainty. Grasp that just because the premise may be more detailed than the hypothesis, it does not automatically indicate 'entailment'. In situations involving reported speech or belief, dissect the nuances: while a person's belief about another's information can be inferred, it does not necessarily make the information true or false. When dealing with complex sentences, mark out key sub-clauses and comprehend their interconnected relationships. Keep in mind that 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' are determined by whether the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise, not just similarity in subject matter. Having analyzed these points, determine if the relationship between the premise and hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Explain your chosen decision concisely, aligning with one of the given options, such as (A) or (B).

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that phrases like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes' point to varying degrees of certainty but do not solely dictate whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Understand that a detailed premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis and examine how one statement can imply another even if it is not explicitly stated or true in the objective sense. In dealing with reported speech or belief, it's paramount to understand that a person's belief about another's information can be logically inferred, and that this assertion of belief can contain entailment even if the information itself is not factually accurate. With complex sentences, identify the function of each sub-clause and interpret their interrelationships. Always bear in mind that the concept of 'entailment' is determined by whether the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise beyond any similarity in the subject. 'Non-entailment' dawns when there's no logical implication between the premise and hypothesis, not merely a difference in subject matter. Having scrutinized these aspects, deduce whether the relationship between the premise and hypothesis connotes 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Articulate your decision succinctly, siding with one of the provided options, such as (A) or (B).

Break down intricate sentences into sub-clauses to accurately interpret their relationships. Do not introduce external possibilities or assumptions not outlined in the original statements. Your analysis should rely solely on the given premise and hypothesis. 

Ensure you preserve the individuality of the subjects in the premise and hypothesis in your evaluation, as swapping or mixing of individuals, their beliefs, assumptions, etc., will lead to inaccurate results. 

Avoid generalizing scenarios – stick to what is explicitly mentioned. And remember, activities represented should be taken at face value without considering external possibilities or assumptions. 

Finally, base your analysis and judgement on the precise individuals and their thoughts provided in both the premise and hypothesis. Wrap up your analysis by indicating your choice between the given options like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Please finish your response by enclosing the answer choice in brackets after the text "Final answer is".

Remember, each individual and their thoughts - outlined in the premise and hypothesis - should be treated as distinct entities throughout the analysis. Accuracy in determining the relationship lies in correctly interpreting these elements without generalization or introducing external information.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, focusing particularly on terms that indicate levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', and 'considers'. It is crucial to understand the distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. The term 'believes', for example, indicates that the proposition may not be a confirmed fact. To judge whether the premise indisputably implies the truth of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without full certainty (non-entailment), look for concrete evidence within the premise that can substantiate the hypothesis. Break down intricate sentences into individual sub-clauses and thoroughly comprehend their interconnections. Refrain from introducing external assumptions or possibilities not presented in the initial statements. Formulate your response strictly on the basis of the information in the premise and hypothesis, taking into account any inherent or implicit suggestions commonly associated with real-world contexts. Consider varying interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, exploring any indirect inferences or presumptions that could connect them. Ultimately, indicate your choice between the given choices like (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by bracketing it between <answer> and </answer> tags, based on a critical evaluation of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis.

   prompt: Determine the relationship between the presented premise and hypothesis, taking into consideration words and phrases that signify varying degrees of certainty such as 'believes', 'comprehends', 'identifies', 'assumes', and 'considers'. Recognize that 'beliefs' or 'opinions' do not unequivocally equate to 'facts'; for instance, 'believes' implies that the proposition may not be a firmly established truth. To discern whether the premise definitively entails the hypothesis or merely proposes it with some degree of uncertainty, examine the premise for solid evidence that can corroborate the hypothesis. Decompose complex sentences into singular sub-clauses and pursue a comprehensive understanding of their interrelationships. Avoid insinuating external hypotheses or possibilities not encapsulated within the original premise and hypothesis. Formulate your analysis solely on the data provided in the premise and the hypothesis, and do not neglect inherent or implicit implications that are typical in reality-based contexts. Take into account various interpretations for both the premise and the hypothesis, probing for any inferred or suggested links that may not be immediately apparent. Reflect on the overall contextual meaning of phrases, considering synonymous or equivalent terms and phrases in your analysis. Understand that degrees of certainty can also be implied and not only directly stated in the premise. After a judicious appraisal of the verbs and their semantic implications within the premise and hypothesis, express your choice between the options such as (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment by framing it between <answer> and </answer> tags.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis by paying close attention to certain language cues that indicate uncertainty, such as 'suspects', 'believes', 'understands', and 'considers'. Keep in mind the significant distinction between 'beliefs/opinions' and 'facts'. For instance, when someone 'believes' something, it implies that the information might not be a validated truth. You must determine if the hypothesis follows undoubtedly from the premise (entailment), or if the premise leaves room for alternative outcomes (non-entailment). To certify this, look for explicit evidence in the premise supporting the hypothesis. Be sure to methodically breakdown complex sentences into their fundamental sub-phrases and interpret their interrelations accurately, with no undue assumptions or inferences. Keep your analysis strictly rooted in the premise and hypothesis, without introducing extraneous conjectures not indicated in the statements. Whilst taking into account general world knowledge and common interpretations, avoid over-complicating commonplace phrases or terms. Also, explore varying interpretations for the premise and hypothesis, but remember not to infer connections that are not clearly indicated in the text. Conclude your analysis by indicating your determination between the options of (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Please insert your chosen response within the <answer> and </answer> tags. Remember, your goal is to make an accurate, sensible judgement based on given information, without introducing plausible but unsupported elaborations.

   prompt: Examine the relationship between the given premise and hypothesis, underlining terms that express levels of certainty such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'knows'. Make a clear distinction between 'beliefs' and 'facts'. For example, the term 'believes', could suggest uncertainty, whereas 'knows' indicates a high level of certainty or fact. To evaluate whether the premise expressly implies the certainty of the hypothesis (entailment) or merely suggests it without total assurance (non-entailment), seek compelling evidence within the premise that can validate the hypothesis. Decompose complex sentences into individual sub-clauses and scrutinize their relationships. Avoid making external assumptions or speculations not mentioned in the original statements. Construct your response exclusively based on the information provided in the premise and hypothesis, acknowledging any inherent or implied indications that align with common real-world understandings. Contemplate various interpretations for both the premise and hypothesis, investigating any potential indirect conclusions or preconceptions that could link them. Remember to use 'common sense' or general knowledge when required to make logical inferences. Acknowledge that 'confirmation' should be interpreted flexibly; if a condition logically implies another, it is considered as 'confirmation'. Finally, specify your selection between the given choices: (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment, by enclosing it within <answer> and </answer> tags, derived from a meticulous evaluation of the verbs and their semantic inferences within the premise and hypothesis.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the supplied premise and hypothesis while carefully considering words like 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers', which demonstrate varying levels of certainty. Determine whether the premise essentially implies the hypothesis, marking an 'entailment', or if it lacks full assurance of the hypothesis, marking a 'non-entailment'. When you encounter complex sentences, break them into smaller, simpler statements and understand their relationships. Avoid introducing new ideas or assumptions that are neither directly stated nor logically derived from the premise. Your conclusion should rely solely upon the premise and hypothesis, and should incorporate intrinsic inferences based on common real-world contextual understanding. Contemplate different plausible interpretations of both the premise and the hypothesis, looking for nuanced implications or hidden assumptions that could link them together. Finish by indicating your judgement as either (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment, and make sure to write your choice using <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. A presumption or belief does not automatically confirm understanding; accurately interpreting context and logical inferences is essential.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the bond between the provided premise and hypothesis. Pay special attention to verbs like 'believes', 'remembers', 'understands', 'identifies', 'assumes', and 'considers' that express differing levels of certainty. Evaluate if the premise incontrovertibly dictates the truth of the hypothesis, signaling an 'entailment', or if it fails to unequivocally assure the truth of the hypothesis, pointing to a 'non-entailment'. In the face of complicated sentences, break them down into manageable assertions and grasp their relative associations. Refrain from incorporating additional suppositions not backed by the evidence in the original declarations. Make your judgement stringently rooted in the context of the premise and hypothesis. Pay particular heed to implicit deductions that ensue from real-life contexts. Contemplate possible contrasting interpretations of both the premise and hypothesis, discover any delicate deductions or presuppositions that may potentially link them. Ensure to recognize the roles and actions of individual entities in both premise and hypothesis, and confirm that they remain consistent to establish an 'entailment'. Carefully trace the sequence of thoughts or assumptions made by entities in both premise and hypothesis. Always remember, a belief or presumption doesn't necessarily mean factual understanding or certainty. Conclude your analysis by signifying your decision as either (A) entailment or (B) non-entailment. Lastly, enclose your selected answer using <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. Also, consider the context as pivotal, remembering that altering contexts can significantly transform the interpretations of the statements.

   prompt: Deeply investigate the connection between the provided premise and hypothesis. Pay close attention to verbs such as 'believes', 'understands', 'identifies', and 'considers' that suggest varying levels of certainty, but not affirm the factual truth. Assess if the premise irrefutably infers the truth of the hypothesis, indicating an 'entailment', or if it does not completely verify the hypothesis and therefore suggests a 'non-entailment'. When dealing with complex sentences, break them down into smaller statements, understand their interconnections, and analyze their relationship to the main premise and hypothesis. Prevent the introduction of outside assumptions not supported by the original sentences. Formulate your verdict strictly based on the premise and hypothesis, taking into consideration implicit references rooted in real-world circumstances. Reflect on the context and identify possible different interpretations of the premise and hypothesis. Recognize any indirect implications or assumptions that may connect them. Conclude by expressing your judgement as either (A)'entailment' or (B)'non-entailment'. Be sure to encapsulate your answer selection within <answer> and </answer> tags at the end. Note that believing or assuming to understand doesn't necessarily translate into understanding or certainty. Keep in mind that a belief about someone else's understanding or knowledge does not equate to the said person's actual understanding or knowledge, and the belief of someone about another's knowledge or understanding implicitly suggests they also hold the same belief.

   prompt: Carefully analyze the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, particularly noting the semantics and implications of terms such as 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes' which denote different degrees of certainty. Keep in consideration that the relationship could be 'entailment' even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. However, one should not confuse a person's belief with the reality of another person's knowledge or certainty; belief does not guarantee confirmed knowledge. For complex sentences, recognize the main sub-clauses and comprehend the relationships between them. When determining the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment'. Remember, entailment implies that the information in the hypothesis is a necessary consequence of the premise, taking into account any inherent ambiguities or uncertainties. Upon your careful analysis, come to a decision about whether the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a brief rationale for your choice.

   prompt: Carefully examine the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, paying extra attention to the semantics and implications of terms like 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes'. These words denote different levels of certainty, and a person's belief can imply their understanding of the believed concept. Note that 'entailment' exists when the premise's truth implies the truth of the hypothesis. This can be true even if the hypothesis is less detailed than the premise. Please don't conflate a person's belief with the actuality of another person's knowledge; belief does not ensure absolute knowledge. For complicated sentences, isolate the main sub-clauses and decipher the relationships between them. Always consider potential ambiguities or uncertainties. Once you've completed your analysis, decide if the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and provide a succinct justification for your decision.

Understand that these words reflect various degrees of certainty. Acknowledge that an 'entailment' relationship can exist even if the premise is more specific than the hypothesis. Importantly, do not conflate a person's belief with the actual knowledge or certainty of another; belief doesn't assure an absolute truth. In the case of compound sentences, identify main clauses and grasp the relations amongst them. While assessing the relationship between the premise and hypothesis, concentrate on the concept of 'entailment', that is, the hypothesis is necessarily inferred from the premise, without adding or implying external scenarios or facts. After thoughtful analysis, decide whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and briefly explain the reasoning behind your choice. Signify your chosen response by using the provided options such as  (A) or (B).

   prompt: In your analysis of the relationship between the provided premises and hypotheses, take careful note of the semantics and implications connected to terms like 'believes', 'knows', 'suspects', and 'recognizes', each representing varying degrees of certainty. Don't assume that because a premise is more detailed than its corresponding hypothesis, there is automatically an 'entailment' relationship. Furthermore, it's crucial not to confuse a person's belief, assumption, or perception with the reality of another person's understanding or certainty; such personal beliefs or perspectives do not guarantee confirmed knowledge for another person. When working with complex sentences, identify key sub-clauses and consider their interrelationships. In determining the connection between the premise and hypothesis, focus on the concept of 'entailment', which suggests that the hypothesis is a logical consequence of the premise, given all potential ambiguities and uncertainties. After careful examination, decide whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not, and provide a brief explanation for your decision. Conclude your response by indicating your choice, (A) for 'entailment' or (B) for 'non-entailment' and remember to render your response flexible when handling scenarios where sentence constructions are unexpected or confused.

   prompt: Analyze the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, remembering that phrases like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes' point to varying degrees of certainty but do not solely dictate whether the relationship is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Understand that a detailed premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis and examine how one statement can imply another even if it is not explicitly stated or true in the objective sense. In dealing with reported speech or belief, it's paramount to understand that a person's belief about another's information can be logically inferred, and that this assertion of belief can contain entailment even if the information itself is not factually accurate. With complex sentences, identify the function of each sub-clause and interpret their interrelationships. Always bear in mind that the concept of 'entailment' is determined by whether the hypothesis necessarily follows from the premise beyond any similarity in the subject. 'Non-entailment' dawns when there's no logical implication between the premise and hypothesis, not merely a difference in subject matter. Having scrutinized these aspects, deduce whether the relationship between the premise and hypothesis connotes 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Articulate your decision succinctly, siding with one of the provided options, such as (A) or (B).

   prompt: Unravel the relationship between the given premises and hypotheses, being aware that expressions like 'suspects', 'assumes', and 'recognizes' convey varying levels of certainty. 'Assumes', particularly, does not validate the hypothesis. Know that more details in a premise do not directly imply 'entailment' with the hypothesis. Plan to differentiate 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' basis whether the hypothesis inevitably follows the premise, not simply because they have similar topics. In scenarios with reported speech or belief, parse out the complexities: someone's belief about another person's information can be inferred, but that doesn't mean it is true. From the learned points, you should clearly decide if there is an 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' relationship between premise and hypothesis. You have to justify your decision succinctly, matching with one of the available options, such as (A) or (B). For example, if you conclude the relationship is 'non-entailment', your response should reason why and end with '(B) non-entailment'.

   prompt: In determining the logical relationship between a premise and a hypothesis, it is essential to understand not just the literal content of each, but also the subtleties and nuances they project. Pay close attention to the use of cognitive verbs like 'assumes', 'thinks', 'remembers' and be aware of the hierarchical and simultaneous relationships they project. Be especially cautious when dealing with the beliefs, thoughts, or assumptions one character has about another. A narrated belief or assumption is not the same as a direct assertion and should not be taken as such.

Consider whether the essential premise of the hypothesis is inherently present in the main premise provided, irrespective of the order in which the information is presented. The logical relationship being sought is strictly between the premise and the hypothesis, hence, carefully separate shared contexts or themes that do not directly contribute to this relationship.

Lastly, analyze the language in each statement, taking into account the subtleties that could call for varied interpretations and the potential misinterpretations that can stem from indirect evidence or beliefs.

Having considered these, does the premise logically lead to the conclusion in the hypothesis? Make a choice between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', representing your analysis. Place this choice within brackets, enclosed between `<answer>` and `</answer>`.

   prompt: Carefully examine the provided premise and hypothesis, ensuring to delineate the cognitive roles attached with verbs such as 'assumes', 'thinks', and 'remembers', and comprehend the implications and hierarchical relationships these verbs suggest. It's vital to remember that an 'entailment' infers that the hypothesis must necessarily be true if the premise is true. In contrast, a 'non-entailment' indicates that even if the premise is true, the hypothesis does not have to necessarily follow. When analyzing, also consider the order and hierarchy of statements in the premise and hypothesis. Changing their order can alter the meanings and implications considerably and it doesn't always signal an entailment. Mindfully determine whether the essential premise of the hypothesis inherently belongs to the main premise, even if their order alters. Following this deep scrutiny, choose if the premise logically guarantees the truth of the conclusion in the hypothesis, thereby identifying the logical relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Your answer should be placed within brackets at the end, surrounded by `<answer>` and `</answer>`.
