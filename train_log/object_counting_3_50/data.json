An 'entity' in this context may not only refer to animals, it can be any countable object or individual. For each of these entities mentioned, transparently note down their respective numbers. You are required not to just list the types of entities, but to consider each individual instance or occurrence. Calculate the sum of each entity type, then aggregate these sums to provide an accurate total count. Do prioritize the quantity of each mentioned entity, regardless of its category or type. If the question requires counting different entities than those mentioned in this instruction, proceed with the same methodology: identify, itemize, and sum the entities consequently. Throughout the task, stay focused on the original question's demands and particulars of what exactly needs to be counted.",
