I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have 9 animals.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 9.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reason:

The failure here is not necessarily due to the prompt, but a misunderstanding of the question by the language model. The prompt asks the model to "Answer questions about causal attribution", which requires understanding and explaining the cause-effect relationship. The question about counting animals doesn't require any cause-effect reasoning, making it out of context for the prompt. The model's incorrect answer seems to be due to its inaccurate computation, it miscounted "two chickens" as one entity instead of two individual animals.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Clarity: Make sure the prompt aligns with what the model is built for. If the model is designed for tasks involving cause-effect reasoning, the prompt should clearly define that any questions must pertain to cause and effect relationships.

2. Specificity: The more specific the prompt, the more likely the model is to understand the type and scope of questions. For instance, if the model is specifically about causal attribution in human behaviors, the prompt could be "Answer questions about causal attribution in human behaviors".

3. Examples: Adding examples to the prompt can help guide the model in understanding the kind of responses expected. For example, “An example of a suitable question might be: 'Why does smoking cause cancer?' rather than 'how many animals do I have?'".

In summary, the main improvements for the prompt involves being clear about the subject matter (causal attribution), being specific about the scope of the subject, and adding examples to guide the type of questions desired.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 
Here, the prompt "Answer questions about causal attribution" might not have directed the model correctly. The model failed to count the two chickens as two separate animals, which leads to the wrong total count of 9 instead of 10. The fact that the question isn't about causal attribution, but a simple count, could have further derailed the model.

Wrong Example 2:
Similarly to the first example, the task isn't related to causal attribution. The model overlooked the accordion as a musical instrument, which resulted in the incorrect total of three instead of four instruments. The prompt didn't give the model adequate context to know that it should be categorizing and counting within a particular context (musical instruments).

Improvements:
1. The prompt should be clearer about the task and not point towards irrelevant actions such as 'causal attribution' when the task is about counting and categorizing.
2. It can guide the model towards the nature of the question by providing clues. For example prompts like "Count specific objects from a list" or "Identify and count items in a specific category" would be more apropos.
3. The prompt should be adaptable to a variety of questions and not specific to a single category.
4. It should be able to guide the model towards understanding the difference between single and multiple entities for accurate results.

Example 1:
Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

The model's response: "You have three musical instruments: a drum, a piano, and a trombone."

Wrong answer reason: The model misses the listing of "an accordion" as a musical instrument, mistaking the count to 3 instead of the correct 4. The problem here does not seem to be with the prompt but rather the model's knowledge and processing of data. The model didn't recognize "accordion" as a musical instrument.

Example 2:
Question: I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

Model's response: "You have 9 animals."

Wrong answer reason: The model fails to consider "two chickens" as two separate entities, thus incorrectly counting them as one and making the total 9 instead of 10. Again, this seems to be a model's recognition problem, not understanding that 'two chickens' refers to two separate entities, not a single one.

Prompt improvements:
In regards to these examples and errors, the prompt does not seem to be the source of the issues; rather, the language model needs to better process the provided information. However, to minimize such issues, the prompt could be made more explicit by changing it to something like:

"Analyze and answer the question accurately considering all individual elements mentioned in the question"
or
"Demonstrate comprehensive understanding to answer the question".

Such prompts remind the model to consider every aspect of data given within the question. Still, the fundamental issue arises from the model's processing capability and its understanding that certain phrases refer to a single entity ("an accordion" as a musical instrument) or multiple ones ("two chickens"). This should be addressed by adjusting the model's training to understand and differentiate such variables accurately.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first question, the model is asked to count the number of musical instruments. However, the model identifies only three musical instruments correctly, missing the accordion.

Reasons for Wrong answer:
1. The model might not understand the accordion as a musical instrument, resulting in miscalculation. 
2. The prompt emphasizes the cause-effect relationships, therefore the model may not focus on understanding categories or classes of objects, like identifying a musical instrument.

Wrong Example 2:

In this question, the model is asked to count the number of animals but it forgot to count the two chickens as two animals. Moreover, after giving the wrong answer, the model asks another question which is irrelevant at that moment.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. The model fails to account for the numerical specification given in "two chickens", summarizing it as just one entity.
2. Similar to the first example, the focus of the prompt is on cause-effect relationships which leads to the model overlooking simple mathematical calculations.
3. The model incorrectly generates an extra sentence which is irrelevant to answering the calculation question, this might be due to the cause-effect emphasis of the prompt.

Improvements:

Based on these misinterpretations, the following improvements could be made to the prompt:
1. Broaden the scope of the prompt to include different types of comprehension questions beyond just cause-and-effect relationships, such as categorization or quantity-related queries.
2. Make the instructions explicit about understanding nuances in language including numerical specifications within object names, e.g. 'two chickens' vs 'a chicken'.
3. Train the model to better recognize and categorize objects within different classes, such as 'musical instruments', 'animals', 'fruits', and so on.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the given example, the following are the potential reasons for the incorrect response by the model:

1) Misunderstanding: From the perspective of the model, the problem lies primarily in misunderstanding the parameters of the task based on the instructions given in the prompt. The model might have perceived the task as answering only cause-effect relationship questions, ignoring the fact that other types of questions can also be asked. In this scenario, the model disregarded the question 'How many musical instruments do I have?' because it didn't involve a cause-effect relationship.

2) Misclassification: The model incorrectly classified the accordion as not a musical instrument. The model might not have been aware that an accordion is a type of musical instrument due to a lack of proper training or data.

Based on these reasons, the following are the areas to improve the prompt:

1) Clarity: Make the expectations and potential range of questions clearer in the instructions to avoid any misunderstanding. Even though the task's primary focus is cause-effect questions, the model should be equipped to tackle other types of questions effectively.

2) Knowledge Base: The model should have a comprehensive understanding and classification of objects and categories, in this case, various musical instruments. This requires a more comprehensive and specific training data set.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions that involve understanding and explaining cause-effect relationships. For instance, you might be asked 'Why does smoking cause cancer?' rather than 'how many animals do I have?'

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions that involve understanding and explaining cause-effect relationships. For instance, you might be asked 'Why does smoking cause cancer?' rather than 'how many animals do I have?'
I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have three musical instruments: a drum, a piano, and a trombone.

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 3.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For the given example, the following are the potential reasons for the incorrect response by the model:

1) Misunderstanding: From the perspective of the model, the problem lies primarily in misunderstanding the parameters of the task based on the instructions given in the prompt. The model might have perceived the task as answering only cause-effect relationship questions, ignoring the fact that other types of questions can also be asked. In this scenario, the model disregarded the question 'How many musical instruments do I have?' because it didn't involve a cause-effect relationship.

2) Misclassification: The model incorrectly classified the accordion as not a musical instrument. The model might not have been aware that an accordion is a type of musical instrument due to a lack of proper training or data.

Based on these reasons, the following are the areas to improve the prompt:

1) Clarity: Make the expectations and potential range of questions clearer in the instructions to avoid any misunderstanding. Even though the task's primary focus is cause-effect questions, the model should be equipped to tackle other types of questions effectively.

2) Knowledge Base: The model should have a comprehensive understanding and classification of objects and categories, in this case, various musical instruments. This requires a more comprehensive and specific training data set.
  
3) Context-Aware: The prompt should entail that the model needs to be context-aware, understanding that questions can correlate to the information provided even if it's not directly a cause-effect relationship.

In this case, a more encompassing prompt would be:
'Answer various types of questions, with a primary focus on those involving understanding and explaining cause-effect relationships. Be ready to answer other kinds of questions too, for instance, you might be asked 'How many musical instruments do I have?' based on given information.'

You have three musical instruments: a drum, a piano, and a trombone. The accordion is also considered a musical instrument, but the lettuce head, cauliflower, garlic are not typically considered musical instruments.

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 3.

Step 1: Carefully examine the question 
The question posed in the input ("How many musical instruments do I have?") is a numerical question, rather than a cause-effect relationship question as suggested by the task prompt. 

Step 2: Consider the wrong answer 
In the response, the model incorrectly excludes the accordion from its count of musical instruments, leading to an under-count.

Reasons for wrong answer:

1. Limitations from the task prompt: The task prompt asks the model to "Answer questions that involve understanding and explaining cause-effect relationships." However, the question posed in the input does not involve understanding cause-effect relationships but is a counting task. This discrepancy could have confused the model and led it to provide an inaccurate answer. 

2. Misclassification: The model fails to recognize an accordion as a musical instrument. This seems to be indicative of a categorical error rather than a misunderstanding of cause-effect relationships. 

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Flexibility: The prompt should be more flexible to allow a broader range of questions, not only focused on cause-effect relationships. Adding sentences like "In addition to cause-effect relationship questions, you may also be asked to count items, classify them, or identify similarities or differences."

2. Clarity: The prompt needs to clarify that questions may not necessarily be related to cause and effect relationships. This can be done by reformulating the instructions as follows: "While many of the questions you will be asked will involve explaining cause-effect relationships, be prepared to answer diverse question types."

3. Training: The model needs training on diverse questions, including categorizing and counting items. This way, it is able to provide accurate answers regardless of the question type.

<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

Prompt Issue:
The prompt provides an example, 'How many musical instruments do I have?' but it doesn't explicitly highlight the need for correct object categorization. The statement "you might be asked" makes it sound very casual and may not stress the cruciality of getting the categorization correct. Additionally, the model is not explicitly guided to identify and discriminate between different types of objects in the provided list.

Model's Mistake:
The model incorrectly identified only three musical instruments: a drum, a piano, and a trombone, overlooking the accordion. This indicates that the model was not able to correctly categorize all the musical instruments. 

Improvement Aspects:

1. Object categorization: Clearly emphasize the importance of proper object categorization so the model can appropriately discern different types of objects.
   
2. Examples: Give clearer examples that show how to categorize objects correctly in the initial instructions.
   
3. Specificity: Make the instructions more specific. Explicitly ask the model to distinguish between irrelevant and relevant objects. Instruction can be made more explicit for it to exclude irrelevant items.
   
4. Clarifying Causality: While not directly related to the error in this case, the cause-effect relationship could be made clearer in the prompt, as it's currently included in the same sentence as object categorization but isn't necessarily related.
   
5. Precision: Emphasize on precision of information and accuracy where the instruction asks to 'consider all aspects of given information for full comprehension'. This includes proper counting and differentiating.
   
6. Rephrasing: Consider rephrasing “keep in mind to consider all aspects of given information” to a stronger assertion such as “It is necessary to accurately analyze and categorize the provided information.”

Revised Prompt:
Respond with accuracy to comprehension questions, ensuring correct understanding and explanation of cause-effect relationships, accurate numerical calculations, and appropriate object categorization. For example, accurately categorize and count in questions like 'Which items from the list are musical instruments and how many are there?' It is necessary to accurately analyze and categorize the provided information, discriminating between relevant and irrelevant objects.

Example 1:

In this case, the language model is not correctly identifying all objects that are categorized as musical instruments. The language model correctly identified the drum, piano, and trombone as musical instruments, but failed to recognize the accordion as a musical instrument as well. This suggests the model may have limitations in understanding or knowledge about all types of musical instruments, which has led to an incorrect answer.

Example 2:

In this sample, the language model failed to count correctly. The language model correctly identified all animals listed in the sentence, but it did not accurately sum up the quantity. The phrase "two chickens" denotes 2 separate animals, not a single entity. It's likely that the language model processed this phrase as a single unit, instead of understanding that it represented multiple animals, resulting in an underestimation of the total count.

Improvements:

1. Improve Model Training: The language model should be trained with a more extensive variety of examples, particularly ones involving different types of objects, including but not limited to musical instruments, animals, etc.

2. Numerical Accuracy: Enhance the language model's ability to process numerical values accurately, making sure it can understand the meaning and quantity of phrases like "two dogs" or "three cats" correctly.

3. Essentiality of Context: Make sure to specify the prompt to state the importance of context understanding. Questions might need the model to comprehend the context first and then respond in accordance.

4. The prompt could emphasize the importance of correctly categorizing objects and accurately counting them.

I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 animals.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 9.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining Wrong Example 1:

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

Incorrect Answer: You have three musical instruments: a drum, a piano, and a trombone. 

Here, the language model has failed to identify 'accordion' as a musical instrument. This could be due to misclassification during the object categorization process. The prompt doesn't emphasize the importance of proper identification of items during classification, which might make the language model overlook certain items.

Examining Wrong Example 2:

Question: I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

Incorrect Answer: You have a total of 9 animals.

Here, the language model has failed to account for the numerical description for 'two chickens', hence only counting it as one animal instead of two. This speaks to the language model's shortcomings in numerical calculations. Even though the prompt mentions numerical calculations, it doesn't highlight the need to accurately count numerical descriptors attached to objects.

Improvement Suggestions:

1. Emphasize Item Identification: Strengthen the prompt to express the importance of recognizing all items during object categorization, acknowledging different types within a class.

2. Highlight Numerical Interpretation: Ensure the prompt stresses the necessity for understanding and interpreting numerical descriptions attached to the objects.

3. Give Clear Instructions: The prompt could better guide the language model with clear instructions like 'make sure to pay extra attention to numerical descriptors tied to categories or objects' or 'not to overlook any item while categorizing'.

4. Provide Diverse Examples: The current examples in the prompt only showcase a cause-effect relationship and quantity questioning of one type of object. Using more varied examples across the task range may lead to more comprehensive understanding.

5. Clarification on Misinterpretations: The prompt could provide some common pitfalls the model should avoid, such as ignoring numerical descriptors or failing to classify certain objects into their categories.

gradient:
Example 1:

Question: I have two mice, a rabbit, two donkeys, a bear, a dog, a snake, a chicken, and a cat. How many animals do I have?

Wrong Response: You have a total of 9 animals.

Upon careful examination, it seems that the model is not accurately identifying individual instances of multiple animals (for instance, two mice and two donkeys). This could be due to the prompt not explicitly instructing the model to consider quantities.

Example 2:

Question: I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

Wrong Response: You have a total of 9 animals.

Similar to the first example, the model is not considering individual counts of multiple entities correctly (in this case, the two chickens). This again is likely due to the lack of explicit instruction in the prompt to account for quantities, which leads to an undercount.

Aspects to Improve Prompts:

1) Clarity: The prompt could explicitly state that the model needs to identify and count individual instances, including when multiple entities exist. Stating this requirement makes it more likely the model will take into account instances where there are more than one of a specified entity.

2) Quantity Recognition: The prompt should involve instructions that direct the model to recognize and count multiple instances of the same entity.

3) Specification: If the task involves counting specific types of entities like animals, specifying this in the prompt could help guide the model's responses.

An improved prompt might read: "Examine the description carefully and count each individual instance of entities mentioned, taking into account when there are multiple instances of the same entity."

Examination:
In this query, the user has listed a number of animals: two mice, a rabbit, two donkeys, a bear, a dog, a snake, a chicken, and a cat. The correct total of these animals is indeed 10, but the model incorrectly responded with 9.

Potential Misunderstanding:
The model could have missed counting one of the animals or might have not accounted for the plurals correctly, specifically "two mice" and "two donkeys". This type of error meant that the model could not entirely identify and count the individual entities in the shared information, hinting at a misunderstanding in interpreting numbers before plural nouns. 

Reasons For Misinterpretation:
The language model could have treated "two mice" and/or "two donkeys" as a single unit (one entity) due to the manner of handling plural forms in the context of the prompt, which did not explicitly provide instruction to account for numbers before entities.

Improvement Suggestions:
1. Make explicit mention of accounting for numbers before entities in the prompt. This can include handling plural forms and understanding their numerical significance. For instance, the prompt could be phrased as "Identify individual specific entities and count them accordingly, taking into account any numerical values connected to entities in the provided information."
   
2. Include an instruction to review the parsed list of entities before finalizing the count to reduce instances of missed elements. E.g., "After identifying and counting, review the listed entities for accuracy."

3. Instruction for understanding the context correctly. E.g., "Consider the semantic context when identifying and counting entities which includes interpreting plurals and numbers correctly."

4. Ruining the model on large dataset which includes counting tasks on different context, will help the model learn practically.

5. The model also needs to be trained to understand the question more accurately. E.g., "How many animals do I have?" should make the model to consider all entities (animals) mentioned and not miss any.

Wrong Example 1:

The question provides a list of animals and asks the model to identify and count the specific entities, which in this context are the animals. The model incorrectly counts the number of animals as 9 despite being given "two mice" and "two donkeys" which should have been counted as four entities but were likely counted as two. This leads to an incorrect total. 

Reason: The model likely encountered a problem with interpreting numerical adjectives that are directly linked to the entities (animals). Its understanding/interpretation of language seems to consider 'two mice' as one entity, instead of understanding 'two' as a quantity. 

Wrong Example 2:

Similar to the previous example, the model incorrectly counts the number of animals despite being provided a list that includes "two chickens". The model seems to only recognize "two chickens" as one entity instead of two distinct entities.

Reason: As with the first example, the model appears to struggle with understanding numerical adjectives preceding nouns, interpreting "two chickens" as one entity rather than two separate entities.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Specify the rule that numerical adjectives before an entity should be considered for the final count of entities: The prompt could be rephrased as "Identify and count specific entities from the provided information. Ensure to consider numbers preceding entities in your final count."
2. Direct the model to count individual units: The instruction could add "Count individual units of each type of entity" to give a clearer direction.
3. Ask for the counting method: Specify that the count should be done for individual entities and not groups, e.g., "Count each individual entity separately, even if they are of the same type or mentioned together." 
4. Make the task itself clear by explicitly stating the need to count each occurrence: "Identify each occurrence of specific entities from the provided information and provide a total count, considering any numerical adjectives provided." 
5. Include examples in the prompt, demonstrating how to deal with numerical prefixes. 
6. Design the prompt to ask complex questions: Instead of a singular task, the model could be tasked with breaking down complex data into different parts for understanding. This would test the model's ability to analyze and count independent entities.

Identify and count specific entities from the provided information
I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 animals.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 9.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

The question provides a list of animals and asks the model to identify and count the specific entities, which in this context are the animals. The model incorrectly counts the number of animals as 9 despite being given "two mice" and "two donkeys" which should have been counted as four entities but were likely counted as two. This leads to an incorrect total. 

Reason: The model likely encountered a problem with interpreting numerical adjectives that are directly linked to the entities (animals). Its understanding/interpretation of language seems to consider 'two mice' as one entity, instead of understanding 'two' as a quantity. 

Wrong Example 2:

Similar to the previous example, the model incorrectly counts the number of animals despite being provided a list that includes "two chickens". The model seems to only recognize "two chickens" as one entity instead of two distinct entities.

Reason: As with the first example, the model appears to struggle with understanding numerical adjectives preceding nouns, interpreting "two chickens" as one entity rather than two separate entities.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. Specify the rule that numerical adjectives before an entity should be considered for the final count of entities: The prompt could be rephrased as "Identify and count specific entities from the provided information. Ensure to consider numbers preceding entities in your final count."
2. Direct the model to count individual units: The instruction could add "Count individual units of each type of entity" to give a clearer direction.
3. Ask for the counting method: Specify that the count should be done for individual entities and not groups, e.g., "Count each individual entity separately, even if they are of the same type or mentioned together." 
4. Make the task itself clear by explicitly stating the need to count each occurrence: "Identify each occurrence of specific entities from the provided information and provide a total count, considering any numerical adjectives provided." 
5. Include examples in the prompt, demonstrating how to deal with numerical prefixes. 
6. Design the prompt to ask complex questions: Instead of a singular task, the model could be tasked with breaking down complex data into different parts for understanding. This would test the model's ability to analyze and count independent entities.

Example 1:

Question: Analyze the given text, recognize different entities mentioned along with their quantity, and accurately count each entity, including those that appear multiple times. I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

Wrong answer: You have a total of 9 animals. 

Reason for Mistake:
The error that resulted in the wrong count of animals is tied to the model's incorrect interpretation of "two chickens" as a single entity. This misinterpretation arises from the prompt's loose instructions regarding the identification and counting of “different entities” and their “quantity.”

The prompt implies that the model should count the unique types of animals, which includes “a chicken” as one entityeven though there are two of them. The prompt does not explicitly tell the model to consider instances where there might be more than one of a certain entity, causing the model to overlook the pluralization of some entities.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. Specify that the model needs to pay attention to the quantity of each entity listed, not just that the entity's presence.
2. Instruct the model to take into account pluralized entities and count them accordingly, instead of grouping them as one occurrence.
3. Provide more clarity in the instructions by asking the model to account for all entities, regardless of repetition.
4. Encourage the model to differentiate between singular and plural entities for an accurate count.

Improved Prompt: "Analyze the given text, recognizing different entities mentioned and the number of each. Pay careful attention to whether an entity is singular or plural. Your task is to accurately determine the count of each entity, taking into consideration every instance they appear, even if they occur multiple times."

gradient:
<1> 
The question: 
The model's input provides a list of animals with their respective quantities. The language model is instructed to analyze the given text, recognize the entities (in this case, the animals), and accurately count each entity. 

The wrong answer: 
The model actually interpreted and answered correctly, recognizing and counting all entities in the text. However, the model erroneously identified the total number of animals as 9, failing to account for the fact that there were two chickens, not one. Also, it gave a breakdown of the animals by type, which was unnecessary based on the given task.

Reason for the wrong answer:
The fundamental error stems from the confusion the LLM might face while understanding the task. The LLM might be having difficulty understanding quantity representations in a sentence (e.g. the term 'two chickens').

Another reason could be the model was not clear on whether it should provide individual numbers for each animal or sum up the total, hence decided to provide both. 

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. The prompt can be more specific in asking the LLM to sum the total quantity of entities present instead of counting each entity individually.

2. The task should also specify not to detail the count of each entity but rather the total sum of all entities. 

3. The prompt should include a clear example illustrating the desired output to serve as a guideline for the required task. 

Final improved prompt:
Determine the total sum of all entities specified in the provided text. Please note, some entities may appear multiple times and should be accounted for in the total. Your output should be a single integer. For instance, if the text is 'I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey.' Your answer would be '10'.

Wrong Example Examination:

For the first wrong example, the prompt requested the language model to recognize the different entities along with their quantities and count each entity. However, the model failed to consider the quantity of chickens, which was explicitly mentioned as "two" and hence miscounted the total number of animals.

Reasons leading to wrong answer:

1. Lack of specificity: The prompt's phrasing concerning counting entities might need to be precise. "Count each entity" could be interpreted as counting each type of entity rather than counting the total of all entities.

2. Overlooking quantities: The model does not correctly interpret the quantities associated with the entities in the text. It sees 'two chickens' as one occurrence, not as two entities.

3. Ambiguity in numeracy: The model might misinterpret the task to be identifying unique entities, ignoring the numbers associated with each entity.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Specify counting methodology: Clearly state that model should count the total of all entities, not just the unique types. For example, "Count the total number of each entity, considering any explicit number associated with them". 

2. Clarify understanding integers: The model needs to accurately recognize and interpret any quantities that are explicitly associated with an entity in the text. 

3. Encourage detailed counting: Instruct the model to account for entities that appear multiple times and accurately count each occurrence.

To sum it up, the improved prompt would be

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

Wrong Answer: Total musical instruments: 3 (Drum, Piano, Accordion)

Step by step analysis:
1. First, the language model successfully recognized the entities mentioned in the question, which are seven in total.
2. However, it failed to correctly identify the number of musical instruments.
3. The model correctly identified the drum, piano, and accordion as musical instruments but missed the trombone.

Reasoning:
1. The language model might have misunderstood or not recognized the trombone as a musical instrument.
2. The prompt's language could be misleading as it asks the model to analyze all entities, their quantities, and those repeating. It doesn't explicitly ask to categorize entities according to specific groupings or properties. The prompt also emphasizes counting total occurrences of entities, which might confuse the model when it needs to count specific categories of entities (musical instruments in this case).

Improvements:
1. The prompt should clearly specify that the model should categorize the entities based on their properties or classification.
2. The emphasis on counting total occurrences might be unnecessary for certain tasks. Differentiation should be made between counting total entities, and counting entities belonging to a specific category.
3. Adding guidelines to focus on identifying groupings or classes of entities may help.
4. It would be helpful to instruct the model to understand the context of the text to better categorize entities.
5. Instructions should include a mention about distinguishing between unique and non-unique occurrences in a context-specific manner rather than as a generalized instruction.

Remember to pay special attention to entities that appear more than once. Your task is to count the total of all occurrences of these entities, not just unique types.
I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
Entities mentioned:
1. Drum (1)
2. Lettuce head (1)
3. Piano (1)
4. Accordion (1)
5. Cauliflower (1)
6. Garlic (1)
7. Trombone (1)

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

Wrong Answer: Total musical instruments: 3 (Drum, Piano, Accordion)

Step by step analysis:
1. First, the language model successfully recognized the entities mentioned in the question, which are seven in total.
2. However, it failed to correctly identify the number of musical instruments.
3. The model correctly identified the drum, piano, and accordion as musical instruments but missed the trombone.

Reasoning:
1. The language model might have misunderstood or not recognized the trombone as a musical instrument.
2. The prompt's language could be misleading as it asks the model to analyze all entities, their quantities, and those repeating. It doesn't explicitly ask to categorize entities according to specific groupings or properties. The prompt also emphasizes counting total occurrences of entities, which might confuse the model when it needs to count specific categories of entities (musical instruments in this case).

Improvements:
1. The prompt should clearly specify that the model should categorize the entities based on their properties or classification.
2. The emphasis on counting total occurrences might be unnecessary for certain tasks. Differentiation should be made between counting total entities, and counting entities belonging to a specific category.
3. Adding guidelines to focus on identifying groupings or classes of entities may help.
4. It would be helpful to instruct the model to understand the context of the text to better categorize entities.
5. Instructions should include a mention about distinguishing between unique and non-unique occurrences in a context-specific manner rather than as a generalized instruction.

<1>
Step by Step Examination:
The question asks how many musical instruments the person has. The model correctly identifies the entities and counts the quantities, however, it disregards the 'trombone' as an instrument. 

Reasons for the Wrong Answer:
1. Ambiguity of Entities: The model seems to have an issue distinguishing what qualifies as an 'entity.' While it could handle counting the total entities in the input, it ran into trouble when asked to further categorize these entities into specific groups (in this case, into musical instruments). 

2. Incomplete Entity Classification: The model's categorization of entities is incomplete. Even though it correctly identified the drum, piano, and accordion as musical instruments, it failed to recognize the trombone as another musical instrument.

To Improve the Prompt:
1. Specify Types of Entities: To avoid ambiguity, be explicit about what kind of entities the model will need to identify. In this case, it was required to identify only 'musical instruments' not simply all 'entities.'

2. Enhance Entity Classification: Whether through incorporating rules or training, ensure the model can accurately categorize identified entities into requested types/groups for analysis.

3. Teach Distinction: Teach the model to associate certain entities with certain classes. This explicit training can help the model understand that 'trombone' is indeed a musical instrument.

Revised Prompt:
Analyze the provided text and identify all distinct entities mentioned, specifically focusing on the class of musical instruments. Ensure to note the exact quantities associated with each entity. Your task is to count the total of all occurrences of these musical instruments, including those mentioned more than once.

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

The model's wrong answer: The model lists the exact quantities of the entities distinctly, and counts the total musical instruments as 3 (Drum, Piano, Accordion). However, it fails to recognize "Trombone" as an instrument.

Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Lack of comprehensive understanding: The prompt requires the model to identify all distinct entities and their exact quantities. However, it does not clearly state to categorize these entities based on any specific parameters. This lack of clarity can lead to the neglect of important classification standards, such as the mentioned "musical instruments".

2. Failure to recognize specific type: The model failed to recognize "Trombone" as a type of musical instrument. This is due to the lack of a rule or guideline in the original prompt for how to classify different types of entities or instructions regarding specific understanding and classification of the named entities.

Improvement for the prompt:

1. Include categorization: The improved prompt should inform the model to categorize the mentioned entities according to their classification or type (e.g., musical instruments, vegetables, etc.).

2. Knowledge application: The prompt should instruct the model to apply its inherent knowledge to accurately classify different types of entities. This will prevent the omission of certain types of entities within a given class, as happened with "Trombone".

3. Require specific understanding: The prompt should explicitly require the model to display an understanding of the specific attributes, functions, or characteristics associated with different entity types. 

4. Precision on total relations: The prompt should require the model to relate the quantities with the specified classifications. In this example, the total number of musical instruments.

Revised prompt: "Carefully analyze the given text, identify all entities, and categorize them according to their specific type. Be cautious of entities that are counted more than once and apply your inherent knowledge base to correctly classify these entities. Make sure to identify the specific attributes associated with different types of entities and relate the quantities as per classifications. Lastly, count the total number of occurrences of each entity, based on its category, including those that appear several times."

In this example, the model seems to misunderstanding the plurality of the 'mice' and 'donkeys' entities. Despite specifying '2', it seems like it only counted as '1' entity in the overall totaling while the repeated quantity is directly mentioned in the text. 

- Misunderstanding of Plurality: The prompt could be clearer about the need to recognize multiple instances of an entity into account, not just unique entities, when computing the total. It may help to stress the importance of distinguishing between 'entity types' and 'entity instances', and specify that the task involves counting instances. 

To improve this prompt, the following aspects should be taken into account:

1. Clarity on Counting Instances: The prompt should articulate more clearly that the model is expected to count instances of entities, not just the unique types. This could involve emphasizing that an entity mentioned multiple times should be counted as multiple instances.

2. Detail on Handling Quantities: The instruction should specifically indicate to take note when entities are quantified, i.e., numbers are attached to them and to explicitly include the number when counting the entities.

3. Emphasize Plurality: Clarify that plurals count as more than one of an entity. This could be important when counting the total number of categorized entities in the text. 

4. Guidance on Summarization: More explicit guidance can be provided on how the summarization and examination process should look like, i.e., tabulating the occurrences of each entity, counting and categorizing them properly.

5. Additional Examples: Providing more examples to the model of what correct counting of instances looks like may assist in helping it understand the task better. This might include examples with different plurality and unique cases.

3. Emphasize Plurality: Clarify that plurals count as more than one of an entity. This could be important when counting the total number of categorized entities in the text. 

4. Guidance on Summarization: More explicit guidance can be provided on how the summarization and examination process should look like, i.e., tabulating the occurrences of each entity, counting and categorizing them properly.

5. Additional Examples: Providing more examples to the model of what correct counting of instances looks like may assist in helping it understand the task better. This might include examples with different plurality and unique cases.

Wrong Example Analysis:

For the given example, the original input text provides a list of animals and specifies their count. The model has miscounted or omitted an animal in its response. Despite the prompt requiring a detail-oriented approach and an accounting of the exact quantities related to each entity, the model has faltered. The error might be due to the model's lack of an understanding of animal categories or a counting error.

1) Misinterpretation of the requirement: The prompt might be too lengthy and complex, causing the model to lose focus on the key task, which is to count the number of animals correctly. It seems to have mistakenly left out the count of an animal in its total sum.

2) Misclassification/Miscounting: Even though the prompt asked the model to pay particular attention to entities that have been mentioned several times, the model might have misunderstood or miscalculated the number of entities.

3) Failing to identify total sum correctly: The model failed to correctly calculate the total sum of all entities, despite the prompt instructing it to do so. This indicates that the model might have problems following instructions regarding numerical calculations.

Aspects to improve based on these reasons:

1) Clarity and simplicity: The prompt might be clearer and simpler. It's important to ensure that the model comprehends the task it is expected to perform. 

2) Emphasize numerical count: More emphasis should be on the model to carefully calculate any numerical quantities provided or implied in the text. This might reduce any counting errors. 

3) Highlighting categories: The prompt should more clearly direct the model to correctly categorize entities.

4) Establishing focus on task: Insist that the model pay more attention to the actual task at hand rather than get muddled with unnecessary details.

5) Clear Instructions: The prompt should clearly instruct the model that it needs to count all instances of the entities, not just unique entities in the text. It should also ensure to handle numerical values associated with the entities correctly.

<1> 
Question: I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

Wrong answer: Therefore, you have a total of 9 animals.

Reason: The model failed to correctly count the entities because it did not make a proper distinction between singular and plural references. When the text mentioned 'two chickens', the system failed to treat 'chickens' as two separate entities. This led to an incorrect total count of animals.

<2> 
Question: I have two mice, a rabbit, two donkeys, a bear, a dog, a snake, a chicken, and a cat. How many animals do I have?

Wrong answer: Therefore, you have a total of 9 animals.

Reason: Similar to the first example, the model once again failed to account for the plurality of 'mice' and 'donkeys'. So, it wrongly counted them as single entities, causing an underestimate in the total sum of entities.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. The prompt can be improved by providing instructions for the model to handle both singular and plural forms of entities. The prompt can mention explicitly that the model needs to consider numerical references before entities to correctly determine their counts.
   
2. The instruction about "Your task is to count the sum of all occurrences of the categorized entities, not just the unique types," could be reworded for clarity. This sentence could be confusing to the model in understanding the difference between counting occurrences and unique types by treating each singular and plural entity as one entity. This could be clarified by stating "Count each instance of an entity as a separate entity. For example, if 'two dogs' is mentioned, consider this as two separate entities."

3. Identify plural forms nouns and categorize them correctly. The ability to distinguish between singular and plural forms of a noun is essential as it directly impacts the quantity of entities considered.

4. Another instruction could be an emphasis on understanding and applying the inherent knowledge, especially about basic numeracy and countable nouns in a given language. If an entity is preceded by a numerical descriptor, the entity is not a single occurrence.

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

Wrong Answer: 
- Drum: 1
- Lettuce head: 1
- Piano: 1
- Accordion: 1
- Cauliflower: 1
- Garlic: 1
- Trombone: 1

Total musical instruments: 3

Correct Label: 4

Reasoning:
- Misinterpretation of prompt: The prompt asks the model to identify each entity in the provided text. However, it seems to be missing context, hence the model wrongly classifies the accordion as not being a musical instrument like the drum, piano, and trombone.
- Lack of knowledge about entities: The language model seems to lack understanding about what refers to a musical instrument. The accordion, as a matter of fact, is misclassified as not being a musical instrument.
- Incorrect focus: While the prompt asks to "count and provide the number of times each entity, whether unique or recurring, appears," the question specifically asks for the count of musical instruments, which the model fails to answer correctly.

Improvement Aspects:
- Contextual understanding: The prompt should instruct the model to understand and take into account the context of the question. 
- Entity comprehension: Whether it's a general or a specific entity, the model should be directed to correctly classify and identify it. For instance, the model should know that an accordion is a musical instrument.
- Directive clarity: The prompt should be more direct and clear about the nature of entity identification, taking into account specific requirements of the question. Instead of focusing on all entities, it should be directed to focus on specified entities in the question (e.g., musical instruments). 
- Domain knowledge: Infuse domain-specific knowledge where needed, so that the model can correctly identify musical instruments, or other specific categories of entities.

Example <1> 

Analyzing this example, the language model has failed to identify "accordion" as a musical instrument. Although the prompt instructs the model to identify each entity, it doesn't specify how those entities should be categorized or classified. So while the model is able to identify each item in the list, it doesn't connect "accordion" with the relevant category of "musical instruments." Therefore, the model undercounts the number of musical instruments, leading to an incorrect prediction.

Here are some points to improve the prompt:

1. Feature specification: The prompt does not specifically guide the model to further classify the entities based on their categories. Enhancing the prompt to make the model categorize each entity pertaining to its class would improve performance.

2. Taxonomy recognition: The prompt should instruct the model to understand and recognize different categories, functions, or types that the entities can be classified into, such as recognizing an "accordion" as a musical instrument.

3. Contextual understanding: The prompt does not encourage the model to understand the context to identify entities more accurately. If the model understands the context, it could better categorize items.

In summary, the prompt can be improved by explicitly instructing the model to classify the entities based on their functions, category, or other distinguishing features, as well as to understand the context of the text for better entity identification.

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?
Wrong answer: Therefore, there are a total of 7 musical instruments mentioned in the text.
Correct answer: 4

Reason: The prompt asks for a thorough analysis of the text to identify each entity mentioned and count the number of times each entity appears. However, the specific task given in this text is to identify and count only musical instruments. The prompt's instructions lead the model to identify and count all entities, resulting in an incorrect answer.

To improve the prompt:
1. Make clear that the task can vary and the model should pay attention not only to the entities in the raw text, but also to any specific instructions, questions or conditions mentioned that could influence which entities are relevant.
2. Emphasise the need for understanding the context, in this case recognizing that not every entity in a sentence would be a musical instrument.
3. Include a statement that the model should not just count entities in the strictest sense, but apply logic and comprehension to decide which entities count towards the final total based on the instructions and the text’s context.
4. Incorporate real-world knowledge into the model's assessment. For instance, understanding that a "lettuce head", "cauliflower", and "garlic" are not musical instruments.

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
The model's input is directed towards identifying all entities mentioned. The problem arises when there is a specific directive in the question i.e. "How many musical instruments do I have?" The model fails to differentiate between the relevant entities (musical instruments) and irrelevant ones (vegetables) because it has been prompt to count all the entities.

Explanation of wrong output:

- Drum: It is a musical instrument and hence, the model correctly identifies it.
- Lettuce head: This is not a musical instrument, but the model includes it in the count because the input prompt asks for the identification of every entity.
- Piano: It is a musical instrument, correctly identified by the model.
- Accordion: It is a musical instrument, correctly identified by the model.
- Cauliflower & Garlic: These are not musical instruments, but they are included mistakenly by the model due to the prompt's general instruction to count all entities.
- Trombone: It is a musical instrument, correctly identified by the model.


Model's prediction of total entities is correct at 7, but the musical instrument count is wrong as per the specific directive in the question. The right answer should be 4 musical instruments. Hence, the prediction is incorrect.


Aspects for Improvement:

1. Modify the prompt to focus more on the nuances of the directives provided i.e. include differentiation between relevant and irrelevant entities based on the context or the specific requirements posed in the question.

2. Train the model to account for the specificity in prompts so it can identify and count only the entities relevant to the instruction or question.

3. Improve the model's grasp towards real-world knowledge and context understanding i.e., it should have enough base knowledge to identify a musical instrument distinctly from a vegetable or vice versa.

4. Incorporate essay-type responses where the model not just counts entities but also states the reason behind considering or ignoring a specific entity. This will cater to a more detailed and thorough evaluation of entities based on the directives.

5. The prompt could also be simplified to avoid confusion and to lead the model better towards finding the appropriate entities as per the context or directive given. 

   For example: 
   "Read the given text and understand the context. Identify all entities based on relevance to the given instructions or questions, keeping in mind real-world knowledge. Count and report only the relevant entities with respect to the context or as per the specific instructions."

gradient:
Examining Wrong Example:

In the given example, the task is to identify and count all the music instruments mentioned. These are drum, piano, accordion, and trombone, which make a total of 4. However, the language model counts all the entities including the irrelevant ones (lettuce head, cauliflower, garlic), thus making an incorrect total of 7 instead.

Reasons for incorrect responses:

1. Overly Complex Instructions: The complexity of the prompt has made it difficult for the language model to accurately interpret the task. This is seen in the response where the model correctly identifies and counts all entities but fails to differentiate between the relevant ones (musical instruments) and irrelevant ones (vegetables).

2. Direction Not Specific: The prompt states 'differentiate relevant entities from the irrelevant ones based on these directives.' However, it did not specify to exclude or ignore irrelevant ones in the final count.

3. Lack of Clarity: The prompt mentions 'understand that a single entity may occur multiple times in different forms,' whereas the list provided does not feature a single repeated entity or any entity in a different form.

Aspects to improve in the prompt:

1. Clarity: The instruction should clearly state to count only the relevant or asked entities excluding irrelevant ones.

2. Simplicity: Instead of complex sentences and unnecessary details, keep the instruction simple and straightforward.

3. Specific: It should specifically state that only the entities asked for should be focused on and not all entities.

4. No Confusion: The prompt shouldn't mention about repeated entities or different forms if there are none in the text. It confuses the model.

Improved Prompt:

Read the given text and identify the entities asked in the question or instruction. Count only the relevant entities or the entities specifically mentioned in the directives. Ignore irrelevant ones. Report the exact number of times each relevant entity appears in the text.

- Piano: 1
- Accordion: 1
- Cauliflower: 1
- Garlic: 1
- Trombone: 1

Total musical instruments: 3

Total entities: 7

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 7.

Analysis:
The model got the answer wrong because it did not correctly identify and count the musical instruments in the sentence. The correct answer should have been 4 (drum, piano, accordion, trombone). 

Reasons:
1. Irrelevant entity recognition: The model counted entities that were not relevant to the question, such as lettuce head, cauliflower, and garlic. This increased its total count.

2. Failure to correctly identify all relevant entities: The model did not count the trombone as a musical instrument, hence reducing its count of relevant entities.

Improvement:
1. Specify prompt: The prompt should specify that the model should only recognize and count the entities directly relevant to the asked question or task.

2. Encourage understanding of categories: The model needs to understand real-world categories of objects. For example, in this case, it should recognize that drum, piano, accordion, and trombone all fall under the category of musical instruments, while lettuce head, cauliflower, and garlic do not.

3. Reinforce directive comprehension: The model should be emphasized to comprehend the specific directives or conditions that differentiate relevant from irrelevant entities.

4. Ensure full entity recognition: The model must ensure every relevant entity mentioned in the context is recognized, not skipping over any.

5. Refine instructions, questions, or conditions: The model should have clear instructions on understanding questions or conditions rather than broadly "deciphering specific instructions, questions, or conditions."

1. Specify prompt: The prompt should specify that the model should only recognize and count the entities directly relevant to the asked question or task.

2. Encourage understanding of categories: The model needs to understand real-world categories of objects. For example, in this case, it should recognize that drum, piano, accordion, and trombone all fall under the category of musical instruments, while lettuce head, cauliflower, and garlic do not.

3. Reinforce directive comprehension: The model should be emphasized to comprehend the specific directives or conditions that differentiate relevant from irrelevant entities.

4. Ensure full entity recognition: The model must ensure every relevant entity mentioned in the context is recognized, not skipping over any.

5. Refine instructions, questions, or conditions: The model should have clear instructions on understanding questions or conditions rather than broadly "deciphering specific instructions, questions, or conditions."

(2) Analyze the given text, recognize different entities mentioned along with their quantity, and accurately count each entity, including those that appear multiple times.
(3) Thoroughly analyze the text and identify each entity mentioned regardless if it's repeated. Every single occurrence counts towards the overall total, bearing in mind that one kind of entity may appear several times. This includes any singular or plural notations. Your task is to count and provide the number of times each entity, whether unique or recurring, appears in the given text.
(4) Analyze the given text carefully, recognizing every entity mentioned, including repetitions. Each occurrence contributes to the total count. Understand that a single entity may occur multiple times in different forms, such as singular or plural. It's important that you decipher specific instructions, questions, or conditions, and differentiate relevant entities from the irrelevant ones based on these directives. Consider real-world knowledge and context in your assessment. Then, accurately count and report the number of times each relevant entity, regardless of being unique or recurring, appears in the text.

gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

In the given example, the model incorrectly identified the total number of animals. The model tallied each kind of animal as one entity, not recognizing that "two chickens" meant there were additional animals beyond the individual types listed.

Reasons for Incorrect Response:
1. The current phrasing of the prompt might be encouraging the model to consider each different type of animal as a singular entity, regardless of quantity. In this scenario, the model sees the mention 'two chickens' as a single entity and does not account for actual numbers.
2. The instruction to "ensuring the numerical significance of plural forms is accounted for" in the prompt might be confusing the model, as it may understand it to identify the entity (in this case, 'chickens') but not count the specific number associated with it.
3. The prompt requests an "accurate count of total entities", which may not be clear enough that this includes individual numbers in a specific entity. The model might be interpreting this as counting the types of entities rather than the total quantity.
   
Improvements for Prompt:
1. Specify that entities of the same type but with different quantities should be counted separately. For example, "two cats" should be identified as two separate entities.
2. Make clear that the model must consider the numerical value linked to an entity and utilize that to give an accurate count of the total entities present. For example, "Consider numbers associated with entities in giving the final count."
3. Modify the "numerical significance of plural forms" phrase to eliminate ambiguity regarding counting individual quantities of an entity.
4. Ensure clarity in the concept of "entities". Clarify whether it means a kind or type of thing, or individual instances of those things.
5. Include an instruction for the model to distinctly count each unit if the entity is mentioned more than once, not just simply identifying the existence of the entity.

In the given example, the model has incorrectly included the "chickens" as one entity, despite the input mentioning "two chickens", which means it should be counted as two separate entities. The model has erred because:

- The prompt might not be clear enough about how plural forms with specific numbers should be handled. Although the prompt does mention "ensuring the numerical significance of plural forms is accounted for," this could be clearer. It seems like the model might have interpreted this as recognizing that a plural form represents multiple entities but not necessarily increasing the count by the specified number.

- The prompt doesn't give explicit instructions about treating each instance of an entity as a separate count. Mentioning "two chickens" should have added two counts to the total since there are two distinct animals in the scenario. 

- The prompt might not provide detailed instructions on how to handle and analyze the numerical information associated with each entity. It vaguely asks the model to identify "each specific entity along with any associated numbers." But how it should treat these numbers isn't explicitly outlined.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. The prompt could explicitly instruct the model to add the numerical values associated with entities to the final count. 
2. It should also make it clear that each instance of an entity, even if they are of the same type, should be counted as separate.
3. To avoid confusion, the prompt could include clear guidelines on how to handle plural forms that have specific numbers linked to them. An instruction suggesting that the plural forms be broken down to individual counts based on the provided number could be useful.
4. The instructions should also provide clear differentiation for plural forms without specific numbers and those with specific numbers.
5. The importance of accuracy in reviewing the enumerated entities needs to be reiterated to ensure exact counts.

<b>Reason for wrong answer:</b> 

The language model seems to misinterpret the task at hand. Although the task actually revolves around understanding singular and plural entities and correctly assessing the total count, the model confines itself to simply identifying entities and listing them out, treating plural entities as singular. Therefore, the count was given as 9 when it should actually be 10 as there are two chickens not one. 

<b>Improvement of prompt:</b> 

Findings can be used to modify the instruction as follows: Ensure you recognize and calculate all entities, including distinct numbers outlined for any of them. Make certain to distinguish between singular and plural forms, considering the quantity for plural instances. After identifying all entities and their specific counts, provide the total number of entities.

<b>New prompt:</b>

Analyze the context deeply, identify every discrete entity along with its amount if any is mentioned in the given information, and count the total accurately. Make sure to differentiate singular and plural forms taking into account the correct count for plural cases. After enumerating all entities and accurate specification of their counts, provide the total count. Confirm the accuracy of the calculated entities count before making the final total.

My current prompt is:
Carefully examine the provided context, detect each specific entity and acknowledge the numbers associated with it. In your count, consider each entity as distinct even if they are of the same type. When you encounter specific numbers associated with plural forms, add the number to the total count accordingly. For plurals with no specific numbers, include them as a single instance.

I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a piano, an accordion, and a trombone. 

Total musical instruments: 3

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 3.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Carefully examine the provided context, detect each specific entity and acknowledge the numbers associated with it. In your count, consider each entity as distinct even if they are of the same type. When you encounter specific numbers associated with plural forms, add the number to the total count accordingly. For plurals with no specific numbers, include them as a single instance.

I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 animals:
- 1 goat
- 1 snail
- 1 cow
- 1 fish
- 2 chickens
- 1 snake
- 1 rabbit
- 1 mouse
- 1 donkey

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 1.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example <1>, the error may have been due to an unclear definition of an "entity" within the prompt. While the model may understand "entity" to have a broad interpretation, in this case, it needed a narrower understanding to specify a type of entity: musical instruments. The drum in the input sentence was overlooked because it was not explicitly stated as a musical instrument. Hence, the instruction should be further refined to encompass subtypes of entities and prompt the model to consider the potential of an item belonging in a category based on its known use, which in this case is a drum being a musical instrument even when not directly declared as one.

In the other scenario, <2>, the model made a computational mistake, not fully comprehending the concept of numbers directly associated with plural forms (in this case, "two chickens"). As per the instructions, the model was supposed to add the exact number to the total count, but it seems it acknowledged 'chickens' as a single instance, hence the count was off by one. 

Improving the prompt could involve:
- Reinforcing the guidelines for enumerating entities that carry a specific number with them.
- Refining the concept of an "entity" to better accommodate scenarios where a subtler understanding is needed, as in counting subtypes of entities or entities defined by their usage or function.
- Clearer explanations or examples about handling plural forms or groupings with specified numbers.
- Including abstract or non-physical entities, which may fall under specific categories/context.
- Asking the model to consider potential categorizations for every enumerated entity, prompting deeper analysis. 

By enhancing the instructions based on these points, the model will have a clearer understanding, which should improve its accuracy in counting multiple and various types of entities.

gradient:
<1> 
The model's input is:
I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

The model's explanation is: 
The model seems to have ignored the fact that the word "two" associated with "chickens" signifies there are two individual entities of the same kind. This could stem from the instruction saying "consider each entity as distinct even if they are of the same type" which it may have inaccurately interpreted to mean that plural forms should be considered as one entity, even if a specific number is associated with them.

<2> 
The model's input is:
I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?

The model's explanation is: 
In this case, the model overlooked the entity "drum" as a musical instrument while recognizing piano, accordion, and trombone. This comes down to the language model's understanding and recognition of what constitutes as a "musical instrument". The instruction does not provide any explicit guidance on how to identify different categories of entities, which may have contributed to this shortcoming.

To improve the prompt, consider the following aspects:

1. Clarify the interpretation of plural entities: The prompt should clarify that a specific number associated with a plural form (e.g. two chickens) should be counted as that many individual entities, not just one.

2. Enhance category recognition: The prompt should guide the model to recognize and include all entities that belong to the specified category (e.g. all types of musical instruments). For instance, it could prompt the model to check each entity against a set of common examples of the targeted category. 

3. Simplify language: The instruction is quite long and complex, which may confuse the model. Try simplifying the language while keeping the essential instructions. 

4. Include an element of review: At the end of the prompt, guide the model to review whether the count of entities corresponds with the different categories of entities in the question. 

5. Specify what to do with unnumbered plurals: In the context of counting, the prompt should be more specific about how unnumbered plural entities should be counted. It's ambiguous whether "include them as a single instance" means to count the plural as 'one' or to count each entity in the plural separately. It could be helpful to specify that unnumbered plurals should be considered as two or more.

Wrong example 1:
In this case, the model doesn't seem to count the mentioned entities correctly. It missed accounting for the fact that when a count accompanies plural entities, this number has to be added to the total entity count. Here, the two chickens should be seen as 2 distinct entities towards the total count of animals, making the total number of animals ten (10), not nine (9).

Wrong example 2:
The prompt fails to convey the necessity of categorizing the given entities according to the question asked. In this case, the model should have separated the entities into musical instruments and non-musical instruments to answer the specific question properly. It appears that the model failed to recognize 'drum' as a musical instrument which leads to the wrong total count of 3 instead of 4.

Improvements on the prompt:
1. The prompt should be clearer about handling numerical counts for plural entities. A more explicit instruction could be: "When specific numbers are mentioned with plural entities, ensure these counts are incorporated accurately into the total tally. These should be considered as multiple distinct entities, not as one singular instance."

2. The prompt should include the importance of categorizing the given entities based on the context or specific question asked. This will ensure accurate responses for prompts that request the counting of a specific subset of entities from a larger list. For example, a suggestion could be: "When the question asks for a count of a particular type of entity, accurately categorize the entities provided before counting."

3. The prompt could benefit from adding instruction on considering widespread cultural knowledge. This would have helped prevent the issue like in wrong example 2, where the model didn't recognize 'drum' as a musical instrument. 

By addressing these issues in the prompt, it will help guide the language model to provide accurate responses, better understand the nuances of entity enumeration, and lead to improved outcomes in tasks.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully examine the provided context, detect each specific entity and acknowledge the numbers associated with it. In your count, consider each entity as distinct even if they are of the same type. When you encounter specific numbers associated with plural forms, add the number to the total count accordingly. For plurals with no specific numbers, include them as a single instance. Once you have enumerated the entities, thoroughly review them for accuracy, ensuring that your final count precisely corresponds to the total number of individual entities present, whether they are singled out or grouped with others.

gradient:
<1> 

Step by Step Examination:
The text input contains different animals of which two are chickens. Thus, the total count of animals should be 10, but the model's output gives 9. 

Analysis of the Error:

1. This mistake could have taken place because of a misunderstanding of plural forms with specified numbers which were emphasized in the prompt. The model may not have been programmed correctly to interpret "two chickens" as two separate entities.

2. The prompt repeatedly emphasizes treating entities as unique and distinct possibly making it harder to understand that "two chickens" should be counted as two, not one.

3. “Entities” used throughout the prompt might be too vague for the model to correctly identify animals as instances of entities.

Improvement of the Prompt:
1. The instructions about how to handle plural forms with numbers might be more explicitly written. For example, clarifying that when a number and a plural form are included together, the number takes precedence and should be used in the tally, e.g., two chickens are counted as two entities.

2. A line could be included in the prompt to specify the meaning of an “entity”, i.e., any animal in this context.

3. The model should be instructed to pay attention to the context of the identified entities and adjust its categorization and counting strategy accordingly. For example, in situations where enumerations of animals are given, it must understand that each animal named, regardless of being singular or in plural form, represents separate entities to be counted. 

4. A simplified language in the prompt might be used to prevent any complication from misunderstanding the task. Complex terms and definitions might confuse an AI model, particularly if it was not pre-trained adequately using similar language patterns.

Example 1
Question: I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?
Incorrect Response: Total number of animals: 9
Correct Answer: 10

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of specific numbers attached to plural forms: The prompt instructs the model to "[add] the indicated number to the total count" whenever there are "[plural] forms with specified numbers attached." In this case, the two chickens are indeed two separate entities, but the model fails to account for the second chicken in the count.

2. Miscount of distinct entities: The prompt details to treat each entity as distinct and unique. Though there are two chickens, the model may have considered them as the same entity due to their identical nature, causing a miscount.

3. Lack of clarity on how to handle plural entities with designated counts: The prompt leaves some ambiguity about dealing with multiple identical entities with predefined counts. This might have led the model to consider the two chickens as one entity.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Specify in the prompt that when an entity is denoted with a specific numeric value, it should be factored into the total count regardless if it's an identical entity or not.

2. Reinforce the idea in the instruction that similar or identical entities with designated counts should still be treated as unique instances.

3. Make the guidance on handling numbers of the same entities more explicit and clear to remove ambiguity.

4. Include a clear distinction between single entities and multiple entities of the same kind. Make sure the model understands  that entities appearing multiple times should be counted individually unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

5. Emphasize the necessity of the model to conduct a comprehensive review of the final entity count at the end, for enhanced accuracy.

Correct Answer: 10

Reasons:
1. Misinterpretation of specific numbers attached to plural forms: The prompt instructs the model to "[add] the indicated number to the total count" whenever there are "[plural] forms with specified numbers attached." In this case, the two chickens are indeed two separate entities, but the model fails to account for the second chicken in the count.

2. Miscount of distinct entities: The prompt details to treat each entity as distinct and unique. Though there are two chickens, the model may have considered them as the same entity due to their identical nature, causing a miscount.

3. Lack of clarity on how to handle plural entities with designated counts: The prompt leaves some ambiguity about dealing with multiple identical entities with predefined counts. This might have led the model to consider the two chickens as one entity.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Specify in the prompt that when an entity is denoted with a specific numeric value, it should be factored into the total count regardless if it's an identical entity or not.

2. Reinforce the idea in the instruction that similar or identical entities with designated counts should still be treated as unique instances.

3. Make the guidance on handling numbers of the same entities more explicit and clear to remove ambiguity.

4. Include a clear distinction between single entities and multiple entities of the same kind. Make sure the model understands  that entities appearing multiple times should be counted individually unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

5. Emphasize the necessity of the model to conduct a comprehensive review of the final entity count at the end, for enhanced accuracy.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Identify and count specific entities from the provided information
(2) Thoroughly analyze the context, identify each specific entity along with any associated numbers in the given information, and accurately count the total entities, while ensuring the numerical significance of plural forms is accounted for. Review the enumerated entities for accuracy before giving a final count.
(3) Carefully examine the provided context, detect each specific entity and acknowledge the numbers associated with it. In your count, consider each entity as distinct even if they are of the same type. When you encounter specific numbers associated with plural forms, add the number to the total count accordingly. For plurals with no specific numbers, include them as a single instance. Once you have enumerated the entities, thoroughly review them for accuracy, ensuring that your final count precisely corresponds to the total number of individual entities present, whether they are singled out or grouped with others.
(4) Rigorously scrutinize the provided information and identify each specific entity, while potentially considering them for categorization based on their usage or function, if any. Highlight the associated numerical values with each entity and tally them, treating each entity as distinct and unique, even if they are similar or identical. Pay special attention to plural forms with specified numbers attached to them and add the indicated number to the total count. If plurals have no specific numbers, consider them as one individual instance in your tally. During your analysis, if you encounter groups or non-physical entities, also incorporate them in your counting if they fall within the context or category in question. After enumerating and categorizing the entities, conduct a thorough review for accuracy, ensuring your final entity count accurately corresponds with the total number of entities whether they are singled out or grouped together.

gradient:
The reasons why the model gave the wrong answer, based on the question and the prompt provided, might be:

1. Interpretation of Instruction:
The context of the prompt is likely causing confusion for the model. Although the prompt asks the model to pay special attention to plural forms with specified numbers and to add the indicated number to the total count, the model seemingly interprets each entity instance separately instead of aggregating the numbers.

2. Treatment of Plural Entities:
The model incorrectly counted the "two chickens" as a single entity, instead of considering it as two separate instances. There seems to be a misunderstanding in how the model should treat these plural entries.

3. Lack of Explicit Emphasis on Numerical Details:
The prompt discussed the handling of entities, plurals, groups, etc., but did not emphasize sufficiently how numerical values should be treated. The model may have overlooked this key aspect when tallying entities.

To improve the prompt:

1. Numerical Aspect:
Make the instructions more explicit about the treatment of numerical values associated with entities. Clearly state that the numerical values should be added to the total count of entities.

2. Clarity on Plural Entities: 
The instructions about treating plural entities with specific numbers attached should be clearer, emphasizing that each instance in the plural entity should be individually factored into the final tally.

3. Simplification of Instructions: 
The current prompt might be too complex with a broad spectrum of possibilities (e.g., non-physical entities, singular/plural forms, groups). Simplifying and focusing the instructions more on the specific task (counting animals in this case) could increase the model's accuracy.
   
4. Emphasizing Correct Errors:
Highlight common errors such as the miscounting of plural entities and explicitly instruct the model to avoid these.

5. Test Runs with Sample Inputs: 
Having additional examples added in the prompt can help direct the model and improve its understanding of the task.

gradient:
<1> Wrong example explanation:

In this example, the model seems to be evaluating each entity separately rather than as a whole group. Instead of simply counting the total number of animals, it first correctly identifies each species and their respective quantity and then stops, not forming an overall total count. This error might arise because the current prompt ("evaluate each entity mentioned in the question and provide an accurate answer") is somewhat ambiguous on how entities are to be evaluated, especially when a summation or tally of numbers is required.

<2> Wrong example explanation:

The second example exhibits a similar issue as in the first example. The model again accurately identifies each animal species and their respective numbers but fails to provide an overall total. Once again, the model misinterpreted "evaluate each entity" as meaning it should individually list out each, instead of forming a summarised count, which was the required answer. The language of the prompt's instructions might be leading the language model to fixate on the details of each object mentioned rather than on the overall question context (count the total number of animals).

Based on these examples, the following aspects could be improved in the prompt:

1. The prompt could specifically mention the requirement for numerical summarisation if that's what's expected in the answer, or in general, specify which aspect of the "*entities*" mentioned should be evaluated (for example their count, properties, functions etc.).

2. For better context understanding, the prompt could include instructions to read and understand the entire context before beginning the evaluation. This might prompt the model to return a more holistic understanding and response.

3. The prompt could clearly state that the final answer should directly answer the query asked in the input, thus leading the model to focus more on matching its output to meet the specific question's requirements.

4. For complex tasks (like counting the total number of multiple labelled entities), the prompt might benefit from specifying how to handle multiple entities as well. As seen in the examples, the model might "evaluate each entity" individually when what's needed is a total number, count, or other data that involves multiple entities.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Evaluate each entity mentioned in the question and provide an accurate answer

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Evaluate each entity mentioned in the question and provide an accurate answer
I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 animals: 1 goat, 1 snail, 1 cow, 1 fish, 2 chickens, 1 snake, 1 rabbit, 1 mouse, and 1 donkey.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 1.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Evaluate each entity mentioned in the question and provide an accurate answer
I have two mice, a rabbit, two donkeys, a bear, a dog, a snake, a chicken, and a cat. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 animals: 2 mice, 1 rabbit, 2 donkeys, 1 bear, 1 dog, 1 snake, 1 chicken, and 1 cat.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 1.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
The question is asking to enumerate the total number of animals the speaker has. The model is not accurately executing this task. Instead, it seems focused on individual entities that have been mentioned. It then provides an individual count, despite two chickens being a part of the entities. This carelessness in counting is causing an incorrect response. The key here seems to be that the model did not recognize the right context of the word "two" when in conjunction with "chickens."

Wrong Example 2:
In this example, again, the model has failed to understand the context of the word "two" in conjunction with "mice" and "donkeys." It’s treating each animal as a single unit, disregarding the actual quantity specified in the question.

Revised Prompt:
Reflecting from these flaws, it's clear the prompt needs revisions so the model acknowledges each entity and its corresponding quantity if given. Therefore, a better revision might be: "Comprehend and count all the individual entities and their mentioned quantities in the question and give a total sum as an answer."

This revised prompt focuses on not only acknowledging each animal's presence but also taking into account their specified quantities. It emphasizes answering with a total summation, which should lead to more accurate results.

From the analysis, the improvements needed are:

1. Make sure the model comprehends and accurately reads any mentioned quantities.
2. The prompt should insist on accounting for all 'individual entities' instead of simply 'entities.'
3. Encourage the model to provide a summation as a response.
4. Improve on context-awareness training so the model could relate quantity adjectives with corresponding nouns effectively.

Example 1:

Question: "I have two mice, a rabbit, two donkeys, a bear, a dog, a snake, a chicken, and a cat. How many animals do I have?"

Wrong Answer: You have a total of 9 animals.

The issue here is that the model fails to correctly count the number of entities (animals) mentioned in the question. The prompt says "Evaluate each entity" which the model seems to take as counting each type of animal separately, without taking note of the quantities involved (two mice, two donkeys). The model only counts unique types of animals, which leads it to the wrong answer.

Example 2:

Question: "I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?"

Wrong Answer: You have a total of 9 animals: 1 goat, 1 snail, 1 cow, 1 fish, 2 chickens, 1 snake, 1 rabbit, 1 mouse, and 1 donkey.

The issue here is similar to the one discussed in the first example, the model doesn't properly parse the question and takes into account only the unique entities, not the actual count of animals. Although, in this case, the model seems to get the count right for the 'two chickens,' but still ends up with the wrong total count.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Specify that the model should account for quantities: Ask it to "Evaluate each entity, along with its quantity, mentioned in the question and provide an accurate answer." This makes the instruction clearer and points the model towards not just counting unique entities, but also considering any explicitly mentioned number of entities.

2. Include examples: For this kind of computation task, its beneficial to include a few examples in the prompt to demonstrate how such calculations should be done correctly. 

3. Prompt rewording: The prompt could be reworded to say "Calculate the total number of each entity mentioned in the question and correctly add them up to provide an accurate aggregate answer." This guides the model towards understanding that it has to consider individual counts and their addition.

4. Encourage comprehension: Instruct the model to "first understand the content and context of the question before providing an accurate answer." This could help in tasks which require a deeper understanding beyond just a superficial reading of the question.

<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

The model misinterpreted the given input in the example. In spite of correctly counting the number of different types of animals, it failed to calculate the total number of animals. This error could potentially stem from two major issues. 

i. The model did not correctly understand the requirement of the task - to calculate the total number of each entity and aggregate these counts to provide an accurate answer.
ii. Another possible reason for the error could be the model's disregard for the specific quantity information in the prompt. The prompt clearly mentions two chickens, yet the model counted them as one entity.

Based on these reasons, the aspects that could improve the prompt include:

1. The prompt's instruction to "calculate the total number of each entity" may have been misunderstood by the model. To prevent potential confusion, the instructions could be more explicit, specifying that the model needs to consider the total count of all entities, not just their types.
2. The prompt could also emphasise that multiples of the same entity must be counted separately, not as a single entity.
3. The language model seems to require reinforcement of understanding the importance of considering numerical quantities associated with the entities to provide an accurate aggregated count. Thus, the prompt could also stress on the need to respect and consider the quantities mentioned for any entity.

Reasons for the model's incorrect output:

1. Misinterpretation of instructions: The prompt instructs the model to "Calculate the total number of each entity and aggregate these counts." This wording is somewhat ambiguous and the model might interpret it as summing the types of entities, not the quantities of each entity. The result of 9 given by the model could be seen as having calculated the different types of animals, not their actual quantities. 
   
2. Confusion over plural form: The sentence contains both singular and plural animal entities, like "a cow" and "two chickens." The model may not be processing the quantity correctly for entities presented in plural form like "two chickens."

3. Ambiguity in definition of "entities": The prompt does not provide a clear definition of "entities." The model might have treated different types of animals as different entities, instead of each individual animal being its own entity.

To improve the prompt, the guidelines could be modified as:

1. Clear instructions: The model should be explicitly asked to count the individual instances of each entity, not just the unique types of entities, and should include both singular and plural quantities.

2. Emphasize on quantity: The prompt could emphasize that any numbers mentioned should be taken into account when counting. If there is no number mentioned before an entity, it means there is one of that entity.

3. Definition of "entities": Clearly define "entities" in this context. If "entities" in our context mean individual animals, it should be clarified.

A revised version of the prompt could be:
"For each question, understand the content and context thoroughly. "Entities" here refers to the individual instances of objects or items mentioned. Carefully note the quantities of each entity, even if it's only implied by an article such as 'a' or 'an'.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
For each question, first understand the content and context. Consider all entities mentioned along with their respective quantities. Calculate the total number of each entity and aggregate these counts to provide an accurate answer.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
For each question, first understand the content and context. Consider all entities mentioned along with their respective quantities. Calculate the total number of each entity and aggregate these counts to provide an accurate answer.
I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?


The model's response is: 
You have a total of 9 animals: 1 goat, 1 snail, 1 cow, 1 fish, 2 chickens, 1 snake, 1 rabbit, 1 mouse, and 1 donkey.

The correct label is: 10
The model's prediction is: 1.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Reason: The model seems to fail in accurately counting the total number of entities mentioned possibly because of the phrasing in the prompt. The way the prompt is structured, it might be causing the model to count and list individual entities rather than aggregating their counts as asked. The model has correctly identified the individuals in its list but has not aggregated these counts to derive the total count. This suggests that the prompt might be too complicated or convoluted for the language model to follow.

Based on these reasons, here are some aspects that could improve the prompt:

1. Simplify the instructions: Instead of using long sentences with multiple steps, the instructions could be broken down into simpler, clear directives. 

2. Explicit emphasis on Total: The task prompt could explicitly emphasize calculating and providing the complete total, making the final objective more clear to the language model.

3. Weight on quantity: More explicit instruction can be given on prioritizing quantity as it seems the model is identifying the entity correctly but not paying attention to the quantity.

Suggested improved prompt could be: "Focus on accurately understanding each question and count all mentioned entities. Specifically, calculate and provide the total number of each entity present."

(1) Evaluate each entity mentioned in the question and provide an accurate answer
(2) For each question, first understand the content and context. Consider all entities mentioned along with their respective quantities. Calculate the total number of each entity and aggregate these counts to provide an accurate answer.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each animal mentioned and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of animals to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each animal mentioned and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of animals to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity.
I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
Animals mentioned: None
Musical instruments mentioned: Drum, piano, accordion, trombone
Number of musical instruments: 4

Total number of animals: 0

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 0.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> 
The model's input is instructing it to focus on identifying animals and their respective numbers. However, the query is asking the model to count the number of musical instruments, not animals. The model wrongly defaults to its given task instructions in the prompt - calculating the total number of animals - even though there are no animals mentioned in the text. Hence, it incorrectly predicted "0" as the total number due to the lack of animals in the content, while the correct answer should be "4" for the total count of musical instruments.

Reasons:
1. Task Misalignment: The task given in the prompt and the actual query in the questions mismatched. The prompt conditioned the model to primarily look for animals, while the question is asking for the count of musical instruments.
2. Lack of Adaptability: The prompt does not provide flexibility in identifying and counting entities other than animals.
3. Limited Instruction: The prompt does not mention that the entity to count may vary, hence it could not correctly interpret the question.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Make the task more adaptable: Instead of asking the model to just look for animals, broaden its scope to detect and calculate any entities mentioned in the questions, such as musical instruments.
2. Mention varying entities: In the prompt, explicitly mention that the entities to be counted can change based on the content of the question.
3. Reinforce Comprehension: Ensure the model is guided to understand the context and the specific details of the question before making a calculation or summing up the total.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each animal mentioned and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of animals to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each animal mentioned and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of animals to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity.
I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
Animals mentioned: None
Musical instruments mentioned: Drum, piano, accordion, trombone
Total number of musical instruments: 4 (1 drum + 1 piano + 1 accordion + 1 trombone)

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 1.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Question: I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?
Wrong Output: Animals mentioned: None. Musical instruments mentioned: Drum, piano, accordion, trombone. Total number of musical instruments: 4 (1 drum + 1 piano + 1 accordion + 1 trombone).
Label: 4
Prediction: 1

Reason:
1. Misdirection: From the question, it's clear that the model was supposed to count the number of musical instruments, but the task prompt is based on identifying and counting animals. This has led the model to initially try to recognize any animals, and when none were found, it did not handle the task of counting musical instruments correctly.

2. Confusion: Although the model correctly identified and listed the musical instruments, its calculation of their sum was incorrect. This discrepancy might be due to the prompts directing the model to focus on animals and their quantities, leading to confusion when the task deviated from its main instructions.

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Generalize Instructions: The task prompt should be broadened to apply to all objects or entities mentioned, not merely animals. For instance, "Identify each object mentioned and their respective numbers. Don't just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of the mentioned objects to provide the correct count."

2. Instruction clarity: Give clear directions on how to handle instances where the entities are different from what's stated in the prompt. Specify that the model should prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity mentioned in the question, regardless of its nature.

3. Handling Different Entities: Include a provision that might allow for different types of entities to be counted. For example, include a direction like "If the question asks to count entities other than animals, apply the same process to identify, list, and sum the total number of those entities."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each animal mentioned and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of animals to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each animal mentioned and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of animals to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity.
I have a drum, a lettuce head, a piano, an accordion, a cauliflower, a garlic, and a trombone. How many musical instruments do I have?


The model's response is: 
Animals mentioned: None

Musical instruments mentioned: Drum, piano, accordion, trombone

Number of musical instruments: 4

Total count of animals: 0

The correct label is: 4
The model's prediction is: 0.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> The model's input is mentioning different objects including musical instruments and vegetables, but it doesn't mention any animal. However, the model is prepared to identify animals, but not musical instruments or other objects. Therefore, when the question asks the model "how many musical instruments do I have," despite the model actually identifying the correct number of musical instruments, it doesn't respond correctly because it's meant to be counting animals according to the instruction given in the prompt. It's a mismatch between the information requested in the input and the task assigned in the prompt which leads to an incorrect answer.

From analysis of the error generated in the example, we can identify a few reasons why the prompt might be leading to incorrect results: 

1. Task Mismatch: The model is trained to identify and count animals as per the prompt instruction, while the question in the input example asks it to count musical instruments. This creates a confusion for the model and results in a wrong output.

2. Narrow Focus: The current prompt focuses solely on identifying and counting animals, which limits the model's ability to respond correctly to questions involving counts of other entities, such as musical instruments.

3. Lack of Flexibility: The prompt doesn't allow for flexibility in identifying and counting other objects when animals are not mentioned.

Improvements to be made include:

1. Broaden the Scope: Enhance the prompt to include not only animals but also a variety of objects, like musical instruments, fruits, vegetables, etc.

2. Increase Flexibility: The prompt should be made more adaptable to count other objects when there are no animals mentioned in the input.

3. Contextual Understanding: The prompt should be designed to make the model better understand the context of the question, rather than rigidly sticking to the task of identifying only animals.

A revised prompt can be: "Your task is to understand the content of each question. Identify each entity mentioned whether it is an animal or an object, and their respective numbers. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of entities to provide the correct total count. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each entity, irrespective of its type."

<1> 
Question: I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

The model's response was incorrect because it summed up the number of different species, rather than each individual animals.

Reason: The main issue seems to originate from the intricacy of the current prompt. While it does mention counting individual entities and their respective quantities, the language used could potentially be misinterpreted by the model, leading it to count types of entities rather than total numbers.

Another thing to note is the model’s understanding of "entities." The prompt instructs the model to identify all entities, not just animals; however, in this case, the only entities mentioned are animals. This might be causing confusion for the model on what to focus on when answering.

Improvement: The prompt could be more explicit about how the model should consider both types and quantities when totaling the entities. It should also clarify what is meant by "entities" and how it's used in differing contexts. The prompt could also benefit from more direct instructions about counting individual entities.

Aspects that can improve the prompt:
1. Elaborate on the definition of 'entity' in different contexts to avoid misinterpretation.
2. Be more explicit in instructing the model to consider both types and quantities when totaling entities.
3. Emphasize that each specific instance of an entity needs to be considered for the total count, not just the unique types of entities.
4. Make sure to remind the model to closely adhere to the question's directives, focusing on what exactly needs to be counted.

Throughout the task, stay focused on the original question's demands and particulars of what exactly needs to be counted.
cur_prompt: Your task is to comprehend the content and context of each question. Identify all entities mentioned, not merely animals, alongside their respective quantities. Do not just list them out, but calculate and sum up the total number of the mentioned entities to provide the correct total count. If the question asks to count entities other than those mentioned in the prompt, apply the same process to identify, list, and total these entities. Prioritize understanding the quantity of each mentioned entity, regardless of its nature.

Wrong Example Analysis:

The main issue lies in the incorrect counting of the total entities mentioned in the sentence. The prompt clearly instructed the model not just to list the entities out, but to calculate and sum up the total number, prioritizing an understanding of the quantity of each mentioned entity.

In this case, although the model correctly identified all the entities and their respective quantities, it failed to count and sum up the total numbers correctly. The total count in this case should be 10 (1 goat + 1 snail + 1 cow + 1 fish + 2 chickens + 1 snake + 1 rabbit + 1 mouse + 1 donkey), but the model gave 9 as the answer instead.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Insufficiency in Comprehension: The model may have failed to comprehend the prompt fully, either by missing out on a critical point in the instructions or failing to adhere to all the instructions in the prompt - mainly calculating and summing up the total number of entities accurately.
2. Quantitative Error: The model correctly identified all the animals and their quantities, but it failed to sum them up correctly. This error could be due to a simple arithmetic mistake.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Clarity: Improve the prompt to make it clearer about counting and adding the total numbers of all entities correctly. While the current prompt does mention this, it might still help to specifically emphasize precise computation.

2. Illustration: Include an example in the prompt to show how to correctly add up the quantities.

3. Simplification: Break down the task in the prompt into smaller, simpler steps. This might allow the model to understand and execute each step of the task more effectively.

Proposed Improved Prompt:
"Your task is to understand each sentence and identify all entities mentioned, regardless of their nature. For each entity, identify its quantity. To calculate the total count, sum up all these quantities accurately. The total count should represent the absolute sum of all entities. Do not just list out the entities, but ensure accurate computation of the total. For example, if the input sentence is 'I have 2 cats and 3 dogs', the correct total count of entities would be 5. Apply this process to every sentence, ensuring exact calculation of totals."

Question: 
I have a goat, a snail, a cow, a fish, two chickens, a snake, a rabbit, a mouse, and a donkey. How many animals do I have?

Model Response: 
Entities mentioned:
- Goat: 1
- Snail: 1
- Cow: 1
- Fish: 1
- Chicken: 2
- Snake: 1
- Rabbit: 1
- Mouse: 1
- Donkey: 1

Total number of animals: 9.

Correct Label: 10.
Model's Prediction: 9.

Step-by-Step Explanation:

The error comes from incorrect counting of the entities. The model didn't recognise that there are "two chickens" and counted it as 1 entity instead. This error is likely due to the prompt not having clear instruction on the way to handle numbers associated with entities. 

Reason For the Incorrect Answer:
1. The prompt was not explicit in instructing the model to consider the quantities associated with the entities. 

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1. The prompt could be more specific about how quantities associated with entities should be computed toward the total count. For example, it could explicitly state that, "In this task, the quantity of each entity mentioned counts towards the total. For instance, if the prompt says 'two chickens', this should be counted as 2 entities, not 1." 

2. The prompt also could mention that every different entity mentioned, regardless of its nature, should be considered in the final count. For example, if five different entities are mentioned, one should not assume the count to be five since there may be multiple quantities for a given entity.
 
3. The instructions could emphasise more on comprehension of numbers as quantities rather than merely recognizing them. This way, the model might be more likely to consider entities with their associated numbers appropriately. 

These improvements should help the model in understanding the context better and providing correct answers.

   prompt: Your task is to understand and interpret the content of each question with precision. When a question is posed, identify all specific instances of 'entities' mentioned. An 'entity' in this context may not only refer to animals, it can be any countable object or individual. For each of these entities mentioned, transparently note down their respective numbers. You are required not to just list the types of entities, but to consider each individual instance or occurrence. Calculate the sum of each entity type, then aggregate these sums to provide an accurate total count. Do prioritize the quantity of each mentioned entity, regardless of its category or type. If the question requires counting different entities than those mentioned in this instruction, proceed with the same methodology: identify, itemize, and sum the entities consequently. Throughout the task, stay focused on the original question's demands and particulars of what exactly needs to be counted.

An 'entity' in this context may not only refer to animals, it can be any countable object or individual. For each of these entities mentioned, transparently note down their respective numbers. You are required not to just list the types of entities, but to consider each individual instance or occurrence. Calculate the sum of each entity type, then aggregate these sums to provide an accurate total count. Do prioritize the quantity of each mentioned entity, regardless of its category or type. If the question requires counting different entities than those mentioned in this instruction, proceed with the same methodology: identify, itemize, and sum the entities consequently. Throughout the task, stay focused on the original question's demands and particulars of what exactly needs to be counted.

   reward: 0.5400 | Q: 0.5400 | uct: 3.1604 | cum_rewards: []
   prompt: Your task is to intelligently comprehend the entirety of the given sentences. It is crucial to identify all types of entities present and their corresponding quantities. Make sure not just to enumerate the entities, but accurately calculate the total number by summing up the individual quantities. For instance, if the input states 'I have a cat, a dog, and two birds', the correct total count of entities should be 4. It's important to understand that each entity has a relevant count, which needs to be incorporated in the final count, regardless of the entity's type. If the sentence asks to count any additional entities, apply the same principle—identify them, determine their count, and include it in the total sum. Make sure the end result reflects an exact calculation of the total entities mentioned in the question. Remember, precision in counting is paramount in order to produce the correct total count.

   prompt: Your task is to comprehend the content and context of each question. Accurately identify all entities mentioned, whether they are animals or not, along with their respective quantities. Emphasize careful calculation and summation of the total number of each mentioned entity by considering their quantities. For example, if 'two chickens' are mentioned, count it as two entities, not one. Do not just list the entities, but provide the calculated total count. Should the question inquire about other entities not explicitly mentioned in the prompt, apply the same technique. Always consider the quantity of each mentioned entity, regardless of its nature and don't assume the count based on the variety of entities alone. The task requires you to discern both the entities and their quantities to reach the correct total count.
