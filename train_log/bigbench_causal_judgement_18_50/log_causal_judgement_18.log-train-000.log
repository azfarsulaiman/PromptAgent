Answer questions about causal attribution
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the pharmacist's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is:

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

In this scenario, the model incorrectly attributes the patient's recovery to the pharmacist. It is indeed true that the pharmacist's signature was needed to administer the drug, but the decision to actually use it despite the risks was made by the attending doctor. The prompt doesn't provide clear guidance to the model to dissect the individual roles and their impact on the overall outcome.

Example 2:

This second scenario is an example of causal over-determination. Even though David increased the temperature, the dryer was already set to MAX DRY, which would have also dried the clothes in the same duration. So, David changing the temperature setting did not specifically cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes. The model incorrectly attributed the drying outcome to David's intervention alone.

Reasons for errors:

1. Ambiguous causation interpretation: The model failed to correctly analyze causal relationships. It attributed the outcomes to those who performed actions rather than evaluating the actual impact of those actions.

2. Lack of guidance to identify key causal factors: The prompt didn't efficiently guide the model to distinguish between correlated events and actual causal attribution, which is crucial to objectively assess causation.

3. Inadequate contextual interpretation: In both examples, the model did not fully interpret the context where the causation result already existed independent of the performed action.

To improve the prompt:

1. Instructions on differentiating between correlation and causation should be added, asking the model to analyze the important factors and their actual contribution to the outcome.

2. The model should be guided to scrutinize the scenarios for over-determined causation, i.e., if the outcome would have occurred even without the specific action performed.

3. It can be aided to pay better attention to the contextual details to correctly attribute the outcome to its most direct causes instead of the performative processes.

4. It should be encouraged to consider possible existing policies, conditions, or pre-set results in the situation which may influence the final outcome independent of individuals' actions.

So the improved prompt might be: 

"Analyse the scenarios for correlating factors and actual causation. Pay attention to over-determined causation where outcomes would have occurred even without specific actions. Consider existing policies, conditions or pre-set results which may impact outcomes."

This added detail should guide the language model to evaluate causal attribution more accurately.

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

gradient:
Example 1:

The prompt instructs the model to use a "typical person's" perspective while answering, which may not necessarily be the most accurate or logical based on the given context. This can lead to inaccurate responses from the model because it's designed to provide answers based on logic and context, not necessarily a "typical person's" understanding. 

In this example, the model incorrectly identified that the sniper didn't intentionally heat up the barrel of the gun, based on the inferred indifference of the sniper towards the heating of the barrel. However, per the correct answer, the intentionality of the shooter setting up the gun, knowing the consequence, and taking the action anyway amounts to intentional heat generation. The model's interpretation of intention versus action may have led to the incorrect answer.

Example 2:

Again, the prompt asking the model to adopt a "typical person's" perspective might have caused some confusion. In this example, the model incorrectly identified that Louie won his bet because of the layup. The model's prediction seems to be based on the temporal sequence of events rather than considering the logical context. 

It's clear from the scenario that even without making the layup, Louie would have won the bet due to his 3-point shot at the start of the game, and thus, he didn't win $100 because of the layup. However, a "typical person" might associate the last impactful moment (i.e., the layup at the end of the game) as the cause of the win, which is incorrect in this context.

Improvements:

1. Remove the "typical person's" perspective from the prompt, as it encourages an approach less anchored in logic and more in interpersonal subjectivity or popular perception.
2. Specify in the prompt that the model should interpret causality strictly based on logic and the context presented. 
3. Clarify that all possible causal chains must be considered (as in Example 2) instead of the most immediate ones (focused on temporal priority).
4. In case of handling intentionality, guide the model in the prompt to consider subsequent repetitive actions as intentional from the causality perspective, despite any perceived indifference towards the outcomes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit.

gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

Wrong Answer: Most people would likely answer (A) Yes <answer>(A)</answer>.

Correct Answer: B

Step 1: Reading the Question
The question asks if the black wire alone caused the short circuit. Based on the scene provided, touching the battery with both the red and black wire short-circuits the machine, not just one. 

Step 2: Understanding the Model's Wrong Answer
The model stated that the answer most people would likely give is (A) Yes. It seems to oversimplify the causal relationship by not considering the conditions mentioned in the scene. It perceives that since the black wire touched the battery and the machine short-circuited, the black wire caused the circuit to short.

Step 3: Identifying the Issue
The issue lies in the model's misunderstanding of the causal relationship and not taking into account the conditional nature of the situation. The machine will only short-circuit if both wires touch the battery, denying the black wire's solo responsibility for the event. 

Improving the Prompt:

1. Clarify the Understanding of Causal Relationships: Instead of asking the model to answer questions about causal attribution, explicitly specify 'complex causal relationships' or 'causal relationships requiring a precise understanding of conditions and outcomes'.

2. Highlight the Importance of Details: Include a clause that emphasizes the importance of considering all details in scenarios.

3. Include Instruction for Conditional Reasoning: The prompt could incorporate instructions for the model to consider and evaluate conditional scenarios properly. 

For example, an improved prompt might be, "Answer questions about complex causal attribution, making sure to consider essential details and account for conditions that might affect outcomes."

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Based on the scenario provided, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. He was fully aware of the consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and chose to proceed with the plan solely for personal gain, showing a clear disregard for the well-being of others.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not cause the circuit breaker to fail. It was the combination of all three people turning on their lamps at the same time that caused the circuit breaker to fail. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For each wrong example:

<1> The model wrongly predicts that Louie didn’t win the bet because of the layup. He indeed won the bet with the layup because the conditions were either a layup or a 3-point shot. The model probably didn't pay attention to this specific condition. Another detail the model doesn't seem to capture is that Louie didn't need to make both shots, just one of them. 

<2> Similarly, the model wrongly determines that Louie won because of the layup. The expectation was for him to either make a layup or a 3-point shot, not both. In this scenario, Louie had made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game. So by the time he made the layup, the condition for the bet had already been met. The model seems to have dismissed the detail that the bet's conditions were already fulfilled.

<3> The model wrongly assumes that Bob intentionally caused harm to the townsfolk. The scenario stated that Bob's objective was to rob the bank and he was unconcerned about the effects of the toxin. The model probably didn't fully process the information that Bob's intentions were focusing on robbing and not causing harm.

<4> Lastly, the model wrongly assumes Jim didn’t cause the circuit to fail. Yet all three turning on their lamps at the same time was the issue, and Jim was part of the trio. The model seems to overlook the causality chain whereby each of the three had an equal part in causing the breaker to fail.

The aspects that could help improve the prompt are:

1. An emphasis on focusing on the conditions or rules of a scenario and respecting the wording of the scenario or question.
2. Encourage the model to comprehend and consider the sequence of events in a scenario.
3. Direct the model to consider intent and individual actions in complex causality. 
4. The model needs to understand that in some scenarios, multiple people or actions can independently contribute to a result.
5. Encourage the model to prioritize express conditions and instructions over inferred ones. 

Improved Prompt: 

Evaluate and provide answers on complex causal attribution questions. Closely examine every detail within the scenario, including adherence to conditions or rules, the sequence of events, and the intent of individual actions. Consider the independent contributions in scenarios involving multiple people or events. Above all, prioritize stated conditions and explicit instructions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Example <1> 

This example illustrates semantic ambiguity in the prompt. In the context of causation, the usage of phrases such as "paying careful attention to each detail" and "factoring in conditional outcomes" are vague and fail to make explicit the necessity of considering both direct and indirect causes.

The language model seems to interpret the cause as the 'direct cause', leading it to attribute the circuit breaker failing to all four researchers simultaneously turning on their lamps rather than Jim individually. However, considering each person's actions as potential causes, Jim's turning on the lamp directly contributes to the breaker failure since his action is not permitted on Thursdays. 

Example <2> 

The prompt does not sufficiently instruct the model to distinguish between intentionality in causation and unintentional side effects. The model chooses "No" because the sniper didn't intend to heat up the barrel, implying the prompt leads the model to emphasize a narrow interpretation of intentionality, ignoring the broader causal implications of the intentional act.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Make the distinction between direct and indirect causes explicit, directing the model to consider hyphenated and secondary effects in determining causation.

2. Highlight the need to consider both intention and consequences in evaluating causation, especially in scenarios with unintended side effects.

3. Specify the necessity of considering rules, norms, or restrictions within scenarios in determining causation.

4. Incorporate instructions to handle the nuance and complexity inherent in causative scenarios, encouraging a more comprehensive analysis of causes and effects.

5. These considerations could shift the emphasis away from a binary assessment of causality (yes/no) towards a more thoughtful, nuanced understanding of individual contributions to an outcome.

A possible improved prompt might be:

"Analyze and answer questions about complex causal attribution, considering both direct and indirect influences on the outcome. In each scenario, be mindful of the significance of each detail, including the restrictions, norms, and roles influencing the outcome. Assess both intended and unintended outcomes of actions and how they feed into the overall result. Consider the complex interplay of intention, action, and result in causation. Based on this nuanced evaluation, select the appropriate option."

The model's prediction is: B.

Evaluate and answer questions about complex causal attribution, paying careful attention to each detail provided in the scenario and factoring in conditional outcomes that might affect the end result.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The typical person would likely answer (B) No, as the sniper did not care about whether the barrel of the gun got hot and did not intend for that outcome to occur. <answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Example <1> 

This example illustrates semantic ambiguity in the prompt. In the context of causation, the usage of phrases such as "paying careful attention to each detail" and "factoring in conditional outcomes" are vague and fail to make explicit the necessity of considering both direct and indirect causes.

The language model seems to interpret the cause as the 'direct cause', leading it to attribute the circuit breaker failing to all four researchers simultaneously turning on their lamps rather than Jim individually. However, considering each person's actions as potential causes, Jim's turning on the lamp directly contributes to the breaker failure since his action is not permitted on Thursdays. 

Example <2> 

The prompt does not sufficiently instruct the model to distinguish between intentionality in causation and unintentional side effects. The model chooses "No" because the sniper didn't intend to heat up the barrel, implying the prompt leads the model to emphasize a narrow interpretation of intentionality, ignoring the broader causal implications of the intentional act.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Make the distinction between direct and indirect causes explicit, directing the model to consider hyphenated and secondary effects in determining causation.

2. Highlight the need to consider both intention and consequences in evaluating causation, especially in scenarios with unintended side effects.

3. Specify the necessity of considering rules, norms, or restrictions within scenarios in determining causation.

4. Incorporate instructions to handle the nuance and complexity inherent in causative scenarios, encouraging a more comprehensive analysis of causes and effects.

5. These considerations could shift the emphasis away from a binary assessment of causality (yes/no) towards a more thoughtful, nuanced understanding of individual contributions to an outcome.

A possible improved prompt might be:

"Analyze and answer questions about complex causal attribution, considering both direct and indirect influences on the outcome. In each scenario, be mindful of the significance of each detail, including the restrictions, norms, and roles influencing the outcome. Assess both intended and unintended outcomes of actions and how they feed into the overall result. Consider the complex interplay of intention, action, and result in causation. Based on this nuanced evaluation, select the appropriate option."

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is:

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

In the first example, the model gets the answer wrong probably because it focuses on the individual function of each wire (the black and the red) rather than the combined or conditional effect that is central to understanding the given scenario. The action of the black wire alone does not cause the short-circuit as its behavior is expected and will not result in a short-circuit by itself. But in combination with the red wire touching the battery, that's what causes the short-circuit to occur. The prompt might not clearly guide the model to emphasize on the combined effect (both wires touching the battery).

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:

The second example is a bit tricky since it adds a new dimension of a passive action (akin to inaction) being a causative agent. The prompt does mention 'factoring in conditional outcomes', but it may not be guiding the model to consider actions of omission (i.e., not doing something) as potential causes. This is evident in how the model arrives at the answer (B), interpreting the scenario in such a way that it seems to suggest Wayne’s inaction is not a cause. However, keeping the watch on the charging pad (which is a result of Wayne’s inaction) is certainly a contributing factor to the watch getting charged, along with it being plugged in.

Reasons why the prompt may lead to wrong answers:

1) The prompt might insufficiently stress the importance of 'combined' or 'conditional' effects that result from the behavior of different parameters in a system, which is critical in understanding complex causal relations.

2) The prompt might not guide the model to consider actions of omission or non-events that might be causative factors in some scenarios.

Improvements to the Prompt:

Taking all these factors together, we can suggest the following changes to the prompt to boost its effectiveness:

1) Instruct the model explicitly to consider combined or joint effects in scenarios where multiple elements interact to cause a particular outcome.

2) Guide the model to regard non-events or actions of omission as potential causal factors in certain scenarios.

A revised version of the prompt may thus read:

"Analytically answer questions about complex causal attribution, focusing on each detail provided in the scenario. Make sure to consider any combined or conditional effects that might arise from the interaction of different elements. Be attentive to both active interventions and actions of omission as possible causal factors. Evaluate all potential outcomes that might affect the final result."

For Wrong Example 1:

The question explicitly states the rules of the scenario: the machine short-circuits if both the black and red wires touch the battery simultaneously, and it does not short-circuit if only one wire touches the battery. These stated conditions should override any inferred notions according to the prompt. 

However, the crucial detail is that the black wire is designated to touch the battery in normal operation. This detail might have led the model to infer that the black wire's touch was inevitable and thus it cannot be the sole cause of the short circuit, as the anomaly here is the red wire touching the battery.

The model probably fell into the trap of focusing too much on the sequence of events ("One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit.") and the prerequisites for the short circuit to occur (black and red wires touching the battery simultaneously). Consequently, it attributed the short circuit to the combined action of the black and red wires, not discerning that the cause lay in the deviation from the normal procedure.

To improve the prompt,

1. It could explicitly mention the need for discerning anomalies from the norm or usual course of action.
2. The weightage or importance given to the sequence of events might need to be reduced when clear causative factors are present.
3. It might need to emphasize more on the analysis of rules and roles assigned to individual actors, to prevent such misinterpretations.
4. The prompt could also stress more on understanding the underlying mechanisms of the system (here, the machine) to make accurate causal attributions.
5. There's a need to explicitly mention avoiding generalizations; in this case, assuming simultaneous contact always causes a short circuit.
6. The model should include additional context in its evaluation considerations, for instance, it needs to recognize normal procedure from deviation.
7. Clarify that actors designated for actions (in this case, the black wire) cannot typically be causes in the event of a failure.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the given example, the incorrect response seems to stem from misinterpretation of the scenario. The model seems to have not properly understood or processed the part about "violating the official policy". While the causal chain suggests that Alice's log in triggered the email being sent, it was Zoe's violation of the policy that set up the situation. As the prompt instructed her to "pay meticulous attention to all details", the model should have accounted for this information, blaming Zoe due to her policy violation.

Reason for wrong answer:
1. Misinterpretation of Causality: The model appears to linearly interpret causality, assuming the immediate preceding event (Alice's login) to be the sole cause. It doesn't thoroughly consider the broader sequence of events. Alice's login was not the root cause; Zoe's action of breaking the policy was.

2. Ignoring Policies/Conditions: The model overlooked rules and conditions contributing to the outcome. The guidelines explicitly mention that the model should consider any stated rules, which here included the company policy allocating access rights.

3. Prioritising Recent Actions: The model appears to give undue importance to recent actions, ignoring earlier related actions which might be significant. This issue is relevant in this case as the system incorrectly attributed the cause to Alice's login (the recent action).

Improvements for the prompt:
1. Emphasize Consideration of Rules and Policies: The model should be prompted to pay additional attention to any explicit rules or conditions in a scenario, especially when determining causal relationships.

2. Specify Non-linear Causal Interpretation: Include in the instructions that the cause of an event may not necessarily be the immediate preceding event. The model should consider all previous events/actions when determining causality.

3. Add Clarification on Policy Violation Impact: The model should be prompted to consider how the violation of a policy or rule may alter typical causation patterns or contribute to particular outcomes. 

4. Encourage Holistic View: The prompt could emphasize that all elements and sequence of events in a scenario are crucial, not just the most recent actions, to ensure a comprehensive analysis.

5. Ask to Evaluate Each Individual's Contribution: The model might benefit from an explicit instruction to evaluate each individual's contribution to an event, which could encourage a more thorough analysis of the entire scenario.

But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

<1>
In this example, the model incorrectly identifies David's action of changing the temperature setting as the cause of his clothes drying in 60 minutes. In the given information, it is specified that the clothes would dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set on HIGH. Since David's dryer was already set to MAX DRY, switching the temperature to HIGH did not contribute to the outcome. 

This error might have resulted due to the confusion in the conditional scenario where more than one condition can lead to the desired outcome but those conditions are not necessarily related or dependent. The prompt might need more explicit instructions about scenarios with independent conditions leading to the same outcome.

<2>
In this example, the model incorrectly concludes that the sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The statement "he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up" implies a causal connection between the sniper's action and the heating of the gun barrel, regardless of his feelings about it. 

This error can be due to the model not correctly identifying the actions leading to undesired but expected outcomes and ambiguity about the usage of the term "intentionally" in the context of indirect consequences. The prompt could benefit from instructions about taking indirect or inevitable consequences of an action into account.

<3>
Jake did not intentionally shoot his aunt, but the response was marked incorrect. Jake’s intentions were to shoot his aunt but his actual action was accidental. The model seemed to have confused intention for a desired outcome with the actual execution of the action. 

The prompt could be improved by including guidelines to differentiate between one's desire for an outcome and their actual execution towards achieving it.

<4>
The prompt does not effectively guide the model to understand that if an OR condition is satisfied by the first clause, the second one becomes redundant. In the example, Louie won the bet because he scored a 3-point shot, rendering the layups irrelevant to the bet. 

This error indicates a misunderstanding about logical conditions and their implications on the overall outcome and causality. So the detail about understanding logical conditions (AND, OR, etc) can be incorporated in the prompt.

In summary:
1. Better guidance for understanding scenarios where multiple independent actions/conditions can lead to the same outcome is required.
2. Enhanced instructions regarding indirect or inevitable consequences of one's actions and how to interpret 'intentions' in such context should be added.
3. Explicit directives about differentiating between the desire for an outcome and the actual execution of intended actions are needed.
4. The prompt needs improved detail on understanding logical conditions (AND, OR, etc.) and the causal implications of satisfying these conditions.
5. The prompt should also remind the model to interpret the scenario based on stated conditions rather than inferred notions.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
Bob did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Example:

In this example, the model incorrectly answered that Henchman Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople by robbing the bank. It seems to have made a causal link between Bob's actions and consequences based on the negative outcomes resulting from his actions (the harming of the town's people). 

The prompt instructs the model to "Account for both intended and unintended results of actions and how they influence the overall event". A possible interpretation made by the model could be that since Bob showed no hesitation and full awareness of the side-effects of his actions, his intention becomes irrelevant. However, this is an erroneous interpretation as the difference between awareness and intention is key - being aware of a side effect doesn't mean one intends for it to occur.

2) Reasons for incorrect answer:

- Misinterpretation of Instructions: The model may have incorrectly interpreted the instructions in the prompt. It seems it has attributed the knowledge of probable outcomes of an action as a direct intention towards those outcomes. The critical distinction between knowledge of outcomes and the intent for such outcomes might have been blurred.

- Neglect of Key Information: The model may not be considering every piece of information provided in the scenario. The model might have missed or not adequately weighed the statement where Bob specifies his intentions ("I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople"). 

3) Improvement:

- Add explicit instruction for the model to distinguish between awareness of consequences and explicit intent.
- Encourage the model to analyze each character's explicit statements and weigh them heavily in the final judgment.
- Make it clear that direct cause and effect relationships, as well as intents, should be derived from explicit actions and statements, not just inferred outcomes. 

Revised Prompt:

Thoroughly analyze and respond to questions requiring complex causal attribution. Pay close attention to both direct and indirect factors that may have led to a certain outcome. Delve into every detail of the scenario, including any constraints, norms, roles, or deviations. Closely consider both intended and unintended consequences of actions, separating knowledge of a potential consequence from the intention to bring that consequence about. Consider not only the immediate cause of an event, but also the broader influences including people's explicitly stated intentions, accidental occurrences, and aftermath of actions. Acknowledge explicit statements made by the characters and let them guide your understanding of their intention. Finally, evaluate these intricacies of cause and effect in order to provide a nuanced judgment.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the direct cause of the machine short circuiting is the fact that both the black wire and the red wire touched the battery at the same time. However, the intended cause of the short circuit was the black wire touching the battery, as it was designated to do so. The unintended consequence of the red wire also touching the battery led to the short circuit.

A typical person would likely answer this question as follows:
- Yes, the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit, as it was the intended action that led to the outcome.

Question: 
"A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?"

Model's Wrong Answer: 
A typical person would likely answer this question as follows: - Yes, the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit, as it was the intended action that led to the outcome. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

Correct Answer: (B) No

Reasoning:
1. The model failed to understand the exact causal relationship between the variables involved. It is stated in the question that a short circuit happens only if both wires touch the battery at the same time. The black wire was meant to touch the battery and wouldn't cause a short circuit alone. So the causal factor here is both wires touching the battery at the same time, not only the black wire.

2. The model focused on the norms and intended actions rather than the factual cause of the event. Although the black wire was 'supposed' to be connected, this wasn't the sole cause.

3. Misinterpretation of the directives: The prompt asks the model to analyze "direct and indirect factors" leading to an outcome. The model, however, incorrectly regarded the black wire touching the battery as a "direct factor" causing the short circuit, neglecting the conditional nature of the short circuit (caused only when both wires touch the battery).

To improve the prompt:
1. Emphasize the importance of strictly factual interpretation of causal relationships beyond norms and intentions.
2. Instruct the model not to attach undue significance to the 'supposed' or 'intended' actions when determining cause-and-effect relationships.
3. Encourage the model to correctly identify and interpret conditional causation, where an effect occurs only when multiple factors are present simultaneously.
4. Advise the model to focus on the specificity of the question rather than over-generalizing the situation. The AI should understand that the question is asking about the specific cause of the short circuit rather than a general occurrence of the event.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To analyze this scenario, we need to consider both direct and indirect factors that led to Louie winning the $100 bet. 

Direct factors:
1. Louie made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game.
2. Louie made a layup right at the buzzer.

Indirect factors:
1. Louie's skill and ability to make the shots.
2. The pressure of the bet and the motivation to win $100.
3. The timing of when Louie made the shots during the game.
4. The rules of the bet, which allowed either a layup or a 3-point shot to count for winning.

Considering all these factors, we can see that Louie won the $100 bet because he made both a 3-point shot and a layup during the game, fulfilling the conditions of the bet. Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To determine whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople, we need to consider both direct and indirect factors that led to the outcome. In this scenario, Bob was aware of the potential harm caused by releasing neurotoxins and chose to proceed with the plan despite knowing the consequences. His primary motivation was to steal money, showing a clear disregard for the well-being of the townspeople. Therefore, Bob's actions can be attributed to intentional harm towards the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

<1> 
In the first example, the question asked whether Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup. The prompt asking the AI to analyze and answer questions about complex causal attribution and consider both direct and indirect factors forced the AI to go too deep into the chain of causation. While the AI correctly analyzed that Louie did make the layup, it failed to understand the implication of the given condition of the bet: if Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, he will win $100. So Louie had already won the bet with the 3-point shot at the beginning of the game, making the layup irrelevant in winning the bet. The complex causal analysis made the AI overanalyze and lose sight of the crux of the question, leading to an incorrect answer.

<2> 
In the second example, the AI was asked whether Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Again, due to the emphasis put by the prompt on complex causal attribution and consideration of both direct and indirect factors, the AI associated Bob's actions with the harm caused, although he was indifferent to the consequences and hence did not intentionally cause harm. The AI's understanding of intention seems to overlook its need to be distinct from knowledge of the outcome. Knowing that an action might cause harm does not equate with intending to cause harm.

Based on these examples, there are several aspects which could improve the prompt:

1. Clear distinction between conditions and causation - When the prompt asks to deeply analyze both direct and indirect factors that may lead to an outcome, it should ensure that it does not confuse conditions and causes. Just because something occurs does not necessarily mean it contributed to the final outcome, especially if the outcome was already secured before.

2. Highlighting nuance of intention - While asking the AI to understand each detail of the scenario including restrictions, norms, roles, or exceptions, it should also specify the need to distinguish between action and intention distinctly in scenarios involving moral judgment.

3. Simplicity - A less complex prompt might help to avoid over-complication of responses where a direct cause-effect relationship is overlooked due to an overemphasized focus on complex causation and a myriad of influencing factors. 

4. Understanding of language usage - The model should understand the meaning of words such as "either...or" in order to correctly identify causal factors.

A suitable revision for the prompt would be:
"Analyze and answer questions about causation, focusing on both simple and complex factors. Understand the subtleties of each scenario, including conditions, norms, roles, or exceptions. Identify the intentions and actions separately, especially in moral scenarios. Understand the clear distinction between conditions and causation. Account for the immediate cause of the event and understand its impact on the outcome. Do not overcomplicate the responses and ensure an accurate understanding of language usage."

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The sniper's intention was to kill the enemy commander, not to specifically heat up the barrel of his gun. The heating of the barrel was an unintended consequence of his actions.

gradient:
Analyzing the error example:

The prompt includes a statement that indicates the model to "pay attention to the intended and unintended consequences of actions," which probably leads the model to focus more on the sniper's 'intention.' When the sniper’s intention to kill the enemy commander at the expense of overheating his gun was clarified, the model appears to have categorically assigned any secondary results such as the heating of the gun barrel as 'unintended consequences,' translating this into a 'No' answer.

However, according to causal attribution considerations, when the sniper knowingly performed an action (firing the gun) that has multiple predictable effects (killing the enemy commander and heating the gun barrel), we can say that he intentionally caused both effects, even if he was only interested in one of them and indifferent about the other.

The key issue seems to be a lack of clarity about how to deal with 'casual but guaranteed consequents' of a particular action, and the overemphasis on having to assign 'intention' before attributing cause.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. The prompt could explain more clearly how to interpret causality when an actor is indifferent towards some of the effects of their actions. This could be done by asking the model to consider 'indifference or lack of concern towards an effect' as determinant to cause attribution.

2. A clearer guideline on how to handle multiple effects of a single action, prioritizing both significant and insignificant effects, should be provided in the prompt.

3. The prompt could ask the model to focus more on the concrete actions and their guaranteed effects, rather than just the actor's intentions.

4. Clarify that 'intention' doesn't allow for categorically dismissing other concrete effects as unintentional.

5. Include a guideline for the model to consider all effects of an action as 'intended' if the action leading to those effects was performed consciously and purposefully. This could be particularly useful in a situation where an actor fully anticipates a consequence but remains indifferent to it. 

6. Modify the prompt so the focus is more on 'causality attribution' rather than 'intention attribution'.

And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The sniper's intention was to kill the enemy commander, not to specifically heat up the barrel of his gun. The heating of the barrel was an unintended consequence of his actions. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Analyzing the error example:

The prompt includes a statement that indicates the model to "pay attention to the intended and unintended consequences of actions," which probably leads the model to focus more on the sniper's 'intention.' When the sniper’s intention to kill the enemy commander at the expense of overheating his gun was clarified, the model appears to have categorically assigned any secondary results such as the heating of the gun barrel as 'unintended consequences,' translating this into a 'No' answer.

However, according to causal attribution considerations, when the sniper knowingly performed an action (firing the gun) that has multiple predictable effects (killing the enemy commander and heating the gun barrel), we can say that he intentionally caused both effects, even if he was only interested in one of them and indifferent about the other.

The key issue seems to be a lack of clarity about how to deal with 'casual but guaranteed consequents' of a particular action, and the overemphasis on having to assign 'intention' before attributing cause.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. The prompt could explain more clearly how to interpret causality when an actor is indifferent towards some of the effects of their actions. This could be done by asking the model to consider 'indifference or lack of concern towards an effect' as determinant to cause attribution.

2. A clearer guideline on how to handle multiple effects of a single action, prioritizing both significant and insignificant effects, should be provided in the prompt.

3. The prompt could ask the model to focus more on the concrete actions and their guaranteed effects, rather than just the actor's intentions.

4. Clarify that 'intention' doesn't allow for categorically dismissing other concrete effects as unintentional.

5. Include a guideline for the model to consider all effects of an action as 'intended' if the action leading to those effects was performed consciously and purposefully. This could be particularly useful in a situation where an actor fully anticipates a consequence but remains indifferent to it. 

6. Modify the prompt so the focus is more on 'causality attribution' rather than 'intention attribution'.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate and answer questions about complex causal attribution, paying careful attention to each detail provided in the scenario and factoring in conditional outcomes that might affect the end result.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about complex causal attribution, focusing deeply on both direct and indirect factors that may lead to a certain outcome. Understand each detail of the scenario, including any restrictions, norms, roles, or exceptions. Account for both intended and unintended results of actions and how they influence the overall event. Consider not only the immediate cause of an event, but also the broader network of influences, including people's intentions, accidental occurrences, and consequences of actions. Evaluate the complexity of causation to offer a nuanced judgment.
(3) Analyze and provide accurate answers to questions regarding detailed causal attribution in complex events. There should be a strong emphasis on discerning and interpreting the factual causality rather than simply intentions or norms. Consider both direct and indirect factors that contribute to an outcome and understand all details within the given scenario, including any restrictions, roles, or exceptions. Pay attention to the intended and unintended consequences of actions, but prioritize the role of concrete causes over mere intentions. Remember that causation can be conditional and an effect could occur only when multiple factors act simultaneously. Keep in mind the complexity of causation and focus on offering a judgement specifically catered to the exact situation presented in the question, rather than making over-generalizations. Understand that the question may be asking about the specific cause rather than simply what is 'supposed' to happen.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

(A) Yes
(B) No

Therefore, the answer is <B>No</B>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

gradient:
Analyzing the question, we can see why the model might have gotten it wrong. The question is asking if the device is fully charged because Wayne did not move it. It is a tricky question because the logical causation is that the device is charged because it was plugged in and on the charging pad. However, Wayne's actions, or rather inaction of not moving the device, essentially maintained the conditions that allowed the device to charge. So, the factual causality in this case is Wayne's inaction, which aligns with the correct answer (A).

The prompt might lead to the wrong answer for the following reasons:

1. Emphasizing Concrete Causes Over Intentions: The prompt heavily stresses the need to prioritize concrete causes over mere intentions. In this case, the model may have interpreted Wayne's inaction as an intention rather than a concrete cause that leads to the device being charged.

2. Direct and Indirect Factors: The prompt mentions considering direct and indirect factors. The direct factor here is the device being on the charging pad and plugged in, and the indirect factor is Wayne's inaction. However, the model may have focused too much on the direct factor and ignored the indirect one.

3. Complexity of Causation: The prompt highlights the complexity of causation but doesn't stress enough on the need to analyze the potential causal attributes of actions as well as inactions. The model didn't factor in the impact of Wayne's inaction which is also a cause in the complex event.

To improve the effectiveness of the prompt:

1. Clarify the role of inactions: Specify that 'actions' also include 'inactions', and both can have causal impact in a situation.

2. Balance between direct and indirect factors: While both types of factors matter, ensure the model doesn't disregard indirect factors in favor of direct ones.

3. Focus on unique specifics: Rather than making generalizations, encourage the model to focus on the detailed specifics of each unique scenario when discerning the cause and effect.

4. Recognize unconventional causes: The model needs to acknowledge that not all causes are conventional or straightforward, particularly in complex events. 

5. Reevaluate the significance of intentions: Despite the initial instruction to prioritize concrete causes over intentions, clarification may be needed as some intentions (or lack thereof) can be a form of concrete cause in certain contexts.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To analyze the causation in this scenario, we need to consider the specific conditions of the bet that Louie made with his friends. The bet was that Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot during the game. Louie successfully made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game and then made a layup right at the buzzer before the game ended. Both of these actions fulfill the conditions of the bet, as Louie made both a layup and a 3-point shot during the game. Therefore, Louie won the $100 bet because he fulfilled the requirements set by the bet, not solely because he made the layup.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Analysis:

For the question "Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?", the model made the wrong prediction as (A) Yes, while the correct answer is (B) No. The mistake can be attributed to the way the prompt asks the model to analyze the details in a given scenario. The prompt's instruction to "consider both direct and indirect factors that contribute to an outcome" seems to have led the model to consider both the 3-point shot and the layup as direct factors contributing to Louie's win, while in reality, the 3-point shot was sufficient for Louie to win the bet and the subsequent layup was not causally significant.

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:

1. The prompt emphasizes on interpreting the "factual causality" over "intentions or norms", and to consider "all details within the given scenario". It seems to have influenced the model to focus too broadly on all actions of Louie rather than on identifying the specific factor that caused him to win the bet.

2. The prompt also asks the model to pay attention to "intended and unintended consequences of actions", leading to an overemphasis on all actions Louie took during the event, even if they did not contribute directly to the outcome.

3. The prompt's request to "consider both direct and indirect factors" may have influenced the model into considering the layup, even though it happened after Louie already satisfied the condition to win the bet.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. The prompt can be improved by instructing the model to identify the first instance when a condition for a specified outcome is met, and not take into account any subsequent similar actions. 

2. It can also guide the model to distinguish between actions that are necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome and actions that occurred but did not impact the outcome.

3. The prompt should remind the model to consider temporal order in causally complex events and recognize that once a condition for an outcome is met, subsequent similar conditions do not contribute incrementally to that outcome.

4. The prompt should stress the significance of understanding the conditions set in the problem scenario and to base its answer on the causality given these conditions.

He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To analyze the causation in this scenario, we need to consider the specific conditions of the bet that Louie made with his friends. The bet was that Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot during the game. Louie successfully made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game and then made a layup right at the buzzer before the game ended. Both of these actions fulfill the conditions of the bet, as Louie made both a layup and a 3-point shot during the game. Therefore, Louie won the $100 bet because he fulfilled the requirements set by the bet, not solely because he made the layup.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Analysis:

For the question "Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?", the model made the wrong prediction as (A) Yes, while the correct answer is (B) No. The mistake can be attributed to the way the prompt asks the model to analyze the details in a given scenario. The prompt's instruction to "consider both direct and indirect factors that contribute to an outcome" seems to have led the model to consider both the 3-point shot and the layup as direct factors contributing to Louie's win, while in reality, the 3-point shot was sufficient for Louie to win the bet and the subsequent layup was not causally significant.

Reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer:

1. The prompt emphasizes on interpreting the "factual causality" over "intentions or norms", and to consider "all details within the given scenario". It seems to have influenced the model to focus too broadly on all actions of Louie rather than on identifying the specific factor that caused him to win the bet.

2. The prompt also asks the model to pay attention to "intended and unintended consequences of actions", leading to an overemphasis on all actions Louie took during the event, even if they did not contribute directly to the outcome.

3. The prompt's request to "consider both direct and indirect factors" may have influenced the model into considering the layup, even though it happened after Louie already satisfied the condition to win the bet.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. The prompt can be improved by instructing the model to identify the first instance when a condition for a specified outcome is met, and not take into account any subsequent similar actions. 

2. It can also guide the model to distinguish between actions that are necessary and/or sufficient for the outcome and actions that occurred but did not impact the outcome.

3. The prompt should remind the model to consider temporal order in causally complex events and recognize that once a condition for an outcome is met, subsequent similar conditions do not contribute incrementally to that outcome.

4. The prompt should stress the significance of understanding the conditions set in the problem scenario and to base its answer on the causality given these conditions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Evaluate and answer questions about complex causal attribution, paying careful attention to each detail provided in the scenario and factoring in conditional outcomes that might affect the end result.
(2) Analyze and answer questions about complex causal attribution, focusing deeply on both direct and indirect factors that may lead to a certain outcome. Understand each detail of the scenario, including any restrictions, norms, roles, or exceptions. Account for both intended and unintended results of actions and how they influence the overall event. Consider not only the immediate cause of an event, but also the broader network of influences, including people's intentions, accidental occurrences, and consequences of actions. Evaluate the complexity of causation to offer a nuanced judgment.
(3) Analyze and provide accurate answers to questions regarding detailed causal attribution in complex events. There should be a strong emphasis on discerning and interpreting the factual causality rather than simply intentions or norms. Consider both direct and indirect factors that contribute to an outcome and understand all details within the given scenario, including any restrictions, roles, or exceptions. Pay attention to the intended and unintended consequences of actions, but prioritize the role of concrete causes over mere intentions. Remember that causation can be conditional and an effect could occur only when multiple factors act simultaneously. Keep in mind the complexity of causation and focus on offering a judgement specifically catered to the exact situation presented in the question, rather than making over-generalizations. Understand that the question may be asking about the specific cause rather than simply what is 'supposed' to happen.

Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by saying:

(B) No

<answer>(B) No</answer> 

In this scenario, it is more likely that the computer crashed due to the fact that two people were logged on at the same time, rather than Jane specifically causing the crash by disobeying the official policy. The over-determined causation of two people using the computer simultaneously is the more likely cause of the crash.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning did not directly cause him to win the game. The outcome of winning the game was determined by the specific rules of the game, which stated that he would win if the total of the dice roll was greater than 2 or the spinner landed on green. Alex's actions of rolling a 12 and landing on green were simply in line with the rules of the game, rather than directly causing him to win.

Therefore, a typical person would answer this question as:
(B) No

A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?

(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person would likely answer "Yes" to this question, as the black wire touching the battery was the specific condition that led to the short circuit. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Model's response: A typical person would likely answer (A) Yes
Correct response: (B) No

This error could be due to the complexity of the causation situation. The model couldn't grasp that changing temperature setting isn't the factor causing the clothes to dry due to the predetermined dryer function set to MAX DRY.

<2> 
Question: Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Model's response: (B) No
Correct response: (A) Yes

The error might be due to how the model interpreted causation. It determined the cause of the crash was two people logging in at once, neglecting the fact that Jane's decision to log despite the policy led to the occurrence of the two-person situation.

<3> 
Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Model's response: (B) No
Correct response: (A) Yes

The model may not have adequately understood the game rules. Even though both conditions (the dice roll and spinner) could cause winning, the presence of either directly leads to Alex winning the game. Thus, Alex's spinner landing on green did cause him to win.

<4> 
Question: Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Model's response: (A) Yes
Correct response: (B) No

The complexity of this overlapping causation might have confused the model. It overlooked that the short-circuit occurs only when both wires touch the battery, hence the black wire touching the battery alone doesn't cause the short circuit.

Improvement Aspects:

1. Specify and underline the distinction between multiple causes and the primary cause leading to an event. 

2. Emphasize better understanding of 'over-determined causation' where multiple conditions independently could result in the outcome.

3. Prompt should explicitly ask the model to scrutinize the information to ascertain how many conditions independently result in the outcome. 

4. Prompt the model to engage deeply with the causal context rather than just differentiating between correlation and causation as these were all causation scenarios, not mere correlations. 

5. Prompt the model to analyse every details provided in the question, to not overlook any potential clues that could give indication of what was the real cause.

6. Ask the model to avoid generalizations when it comes to causation and treat every scenario as unique situation.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.

Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The heating of the barrel was a side effect of his intentional action of shooting and killing the enemy commander. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Wrong Answer: (B) No

Correct Answer: (A) Yes

Reasons for the wrong answer:
1) Perspective: The model seems to form a human perspective and attributed intent based on the desires and goals of the 'actor' in this scenario. But the prompt asks for analysis of causality, which is more factual and doesn't necessarily correlate with intent from a mental or emotional perspective.

2) Overemphasis on 'intentional': The model seems to focus on whether the action was intentionally performed toward the heating of the gun barrel rather than focusing on whether the action performed led to the heating of the barrel, which causes a misinterpretation of the question.

3) Unclear instructions: The instruction in the prompt about 'actual causation' isn't clear enough. The model failed to differentiate the causes from the effects of the action, and its understanding of 'actual causation' needs improvement.

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1) Specification: Specify that intentionality should be differentiated from causality. Intention refers to the subjective desire to carry out an action, while causality refers to the objective result that is produced by the action.

2) Clarity: Make clear that 'actual causation' refers to whether an action directly causes a specific outcome. The language model should identify direct cause-effect relationships, disregarding the character's personal feelings or intentions.

3) Differentiation: Clearly mention that the model should distinguish the causes from the effects and should focus on the outcome of the action rather than the motives behind it.

4) Precise Instruction: Request the model not only to consider the factors, policies, and conditions leading to an outcome but to prioritize the objective relationship between action and outcome over subjective intent. The model should focus on whether an action led to the outcome regardless of the actor's true intentions.

David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie won the $100 bet because he made a layup. However, it is important to note that the actual causation of Louie winning the bet was not solely because he made the layup. The outcome was a result of both Louie making a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game and making a layup at the end. Therefore, the over-determined causation led to Louie winning the bet.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example
The question here addresses an example of over-determined causation where the outcome could occur due to two independent conditions (the dryer set to MAX DRY or the temperature set to HIGH) sufficing individually. When David changes the temperature setting, it seems like he caused the outcome. However, as the dryer setting was already MAX DRY, the clothes would dry in sixty minutes regardless. So, it is wrong to say that David’s clothing dried in 60 minutes because he changed the temperature. The prompt potentially leads the model astray by emphasizing on "factors", "policies", and "conditions leading to the outcome" without clarifying that multiple independent conditions can lead to the same outcome separately. 

<2> Wrong Example
In this scenario, Jane caused the computer to crash by logging in at the same time as Lauren, against company policy. However, the model answered that Jane did not cause the crash. The prompt might lead the model to interpret the company policy as a determinant factor, potentially overlooking individual actions that violate the policy and still impact outcomes. It does not effectively communicate the importance of considering all contingities - policy adherence or violation alike - in identifying causality. 

<3> Wrong Example
The context of this scenario shows that Louie made both a 3-point shot and a layup, any of which satisfies the condition to win $100. But the model incorrectly attributes the winning of the bet to the layup only. The prompt does not effectively highlight the need to consider the relative timing of events towards the outcome, where an earlier event (the 3-point shot) satisfied the winning conditions prior to the subsequent event (layup).

Comprehensive reasons for the wrong answers:
A. The prompt lacks clarity on handling over-determined causations where multiple independent factors can lead to the same outcome.
B. The wording of the prompt might cause an overemphasis on existing policies or conditions while overlooking individual actions, which can also lead to the outcome. 
C. The prompt does not guide the model to consider the temporal sequence of causal factors, which can be crucial in some scenarios.

Prompt Improvements:
1. Incorporate clear instructions about identifying causality in scenarios with over-determined or under-determined conditions.
2. Specify that the model must consider direct actions by individuals, policy violations, or any unforeseen factors that may contribute to the outcome.
3. Include guidance on factoring in the temporal sequence of events while attributing causality.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to administer the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. While it is true that the patient recovered after receiving the drug, it is important to consider the multiple factors at play in this situation. The intern's decision to administer the drug, the pharmacist's approval, and the attending doctor's signature all contributed to the outcome. Additionally, the patient's own body's response to the drug played a significant role in the recovery. Therefore, it would be incorrect to solely attribute the patient's recovery to the attending doctor's decision.

Question Analysis:
The question presents a scenario where a patient recovers due to a drug being administered. The question specifically asks if the attending doctor's decision "caused" the recovery. Here, despite the action of prescribing the drug defying hospital policy and was a risk, it's a fact that after the drug was administered the patient recovered. 

Wrong Answer Analysis:
The model focuses on differentiating correlation from causation. In this case, it denies causation from the attending doctor's action because many factors were at play in administering the drug. It considers the pharmacist checking the stock availability leading to the approval, and the intern for initiating the process. Also, it takes into account the patient's own physiological response to the drug. Because these were all stimuli preceding the recovery, the model associated each of them with the patient's recovery instead of affirming the attending doctor's action as a causative factor.

Reasons for Wrong Answer:
1. Overemphasis on Differentiating Correlation from Causation: The task is set to ensure that the model understands that correlation does not equate causation. However, this may make it overly cautious in attributing causation where it is actually applicable. 

2. Evaluation Metric: Prompt focuses significantly on discerning "direct" causes, which may lead to the system not giving due attribution to other aspects of a multifaceted situation.

3. Complexity of Task: The complexity and nuance of this task cannot be underestimated. It involves deep reasoning about multiple independant factors in a situatuion. The system might prove insufficient to handle these nuanced scenarios.

Improvements to the Prompt: 
1. Clearly define "Causation": Elaborate what constitutes "direct causes". This clarification can enable the model to assign causation correctly in complex scenarios.

2. Prioritization: Prompt should instruct the model to prioritize actions that appear to have a stronger effect on the outcome, even when other factors are at play.

3. Evaluation of Potential Causes: The model should evaluate each potential cause individually to determine their potential contribution to the result.

4. Balance in Consideration: Prompt should instruct the model to provide a balanced view that assigns causation appropriately without completely denying the potential cause-factor relationship in a given scenario. 

5. Case-by-case Basis: The prompt should instruct the model to approach each scenario on a case-by-case basis with no predefined biases towards the possibility or impossibility of causation.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze and respond to questions regarding causal attribution differentiating correlation from true causation. Pay particular attention to scenarios of over-determined causation or under-determined situations where multiple independent factors could lead to the same outcome. Carefully consider all contributing elements, including direct actions by individuals, potential policy violations, and unforeseen factors. Ensure you account for existing policies and conditions, assessing their impact on the outcome. Do not forget to factor in the temporal sequence of events while attribiting causality. Your task is to discern the direct causes that lead to the given outcome, understanding that correlation does not equate causation.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to administer the drug did not directly cause the patient's recovery. While it is true that the patient recovered after receiving the drug, it is important to consider the multiple factors at play in this situation. The intern's decision to administer the drug, the pharmacist's approval, and the attending doctor's signature all contributed to the outcome. Additionally, the patient's own body's response to the drug played a significant role in the recovery. Therefore, it would be incorrect to solely attribute the patient's recovery to the attending doctor's decision.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Even though his primary goal was to steal money from the bank, he was fully aware of the consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and its potential impact on the townspeople's health. Bob's disregard for the well-being of the townspeople and his willingness to proceed with the plan despite knowing the harmful effects demonstrate his intention to harm them.

The language model seems to misunderstand that because multiple factors (dice roll and spinner result) led to the outcome (Alex winning), it means none of them directly caused the outcome. This contradicts the over-determined scenario indicated in the task, where multiple independent factors could lead to the same outcome. 

<2> Wrong example analysis:

Bob's disregard for the well-being of the townspeople and his willingness to proceed with the plan despite knowing the harmful effects demonstrate his intention to harm them. <answer>(A) Yes</answer>"

The language model seems to interpret knowledge of the possible consequences as intent here, but the question specified intent regarding the health of the townspeople, not just acceptance of a potential consequence. The model conflated direct intent with a lack of regard for health impact. 

Suggestions for improving the prompt:

1. Specify that the model should focus on the direct cause(s) or intent even when multiple factors lead to the final outcome in over-determined situations.

2. Clarify the definition of "intent" and "direct cause" in the context of the task, specifying that the presence of negative outcomes is not the same as intending them.

3. Encourage the model to pay attention to the precise wording or phrasing when determining causality or intent - there can be nuances in language that could potentially change the perceived causality or intent.

4. Guide the model better on dealing with scenarios where the concept of causality or intent is complex due to multiple overlapping influences.

This could include situations where multiple factors could lead to the same outcome (over-determined or under-determined situations), or where correlation needs to be distinguished from true causation. In particular, concentrate on deciphering the intent behind actions when it is specifically mentioned. Remember, the presence of expected or unintended outcomes does not necessarily imply intent. Carefully consider all contributing elements, such as individual's actions, existing policies and conditions, unforeseen factors, and the sequence of events. Based on these, discern the direct causes or intent that led to the outcome. Please be mindful that understanding direct cause or intent is nuanced, and often requires careful parsing of the language used in the question. Clear up ambiguities instead of assuming causality. Account correlation as a factor but not conflating it with causation. Your response should conclude with an answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
cur_prompt: Analyze and respond to questions regarding causal attribution differentiating correlation from true causation. Pay particular attention to scenarios of over-determined causation or under-determined situations where multiple independent factors could lead to the same outcome. Carefully consider all contributing elements, including direct actions by individuals, potential policy violations, and unforeseen factors. Ensure you account for existing policies and conditions, assessing their impact on the outcome. Do not forget to factor in the temporal sequence of events while attribiting causality. Your task is to discern the direct causes that lead to the given outcome, understanding that correlation does not equate causation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer this question by saying that Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did cause the circuit breaker to fail, as it was the fourth lamp turned on at the same time. However, a more careful analysis would reveal that the true cause of the circuit breaker failing was the simultaneous turning on of four lamps, not just Jim turning on his lamp. Therefore, the correct answer is:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In the question, it's mentioned that the circuit breaker will fail if four people turn their lamps on at the same time. Since Jim was one of the four people turning on the lamp, he contributed to the breaker failing. The model answered incorrectly by saying Jim's action alone was not the cause. However, the prompt asked to discern the direct causes of the given outcome. Even though there were four different people involved, each one of their actions was a direct cause, including Jim's. This misunderstanding arises from the model's over-application of the principle of separating correlation from causation.

<2> 
The model seemed to overlook the mention that the machine will not short circuit if just one of the wires touches the battery. Even though the black wire was supposed to touch the battery, its touch wasn’t the cause of the short circuit. It is the simultaneous connection of both wires leading to the short circuit rather than the black wire alone. The model misinterpreted the given causal relationship due to the language of the prompt, specifically its request to "discern the direct causes."

<3> 
The model failed to differentiate between intention and consequence. The sniper did knowingly take an action (pulling the trigger) that would result in the barrel getting hot. But the model judged the intention solely based on the sniper's motivation (to kill the commander, not to heat the barrel). The prompt’s request to consider direct actions by individuals and existing conditions might have misled the model into thinking that intentions are wholly dependent on motivation, ignoring the foreseeability of the outcome.

To improve the prompt, we could:

1. Be clearer about what constitutes a direct cause.
2. Elaborate on the differentiation between correlation and causation to help the model understand that when a sequence of events is causally interconnected, each event can be a cause.
3. Include a specific instruction that urges the model also to take into account the foreseeable consequences of an individual's actions when considering intention.
4. Further emphasize on the necessity to focus not only on primary motivations but also on secondary effects that are knowingly brought about.

Ultimately, the improved prompt should guide the model in better parsing the causality in complex scenarios, ensuring it gives weight to all factors appropriately.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Even though his primary goal was to steal money from the bank, he was fully aware of the consequences of releasing the neurotoxins and how it would harm the townspeople through increased susceptibility to the poison in the water supply. Bob's disregard for the well-being of the townspeople and his willingness to proceed with the plan despite knowing the potential harm clearly demonstrates his intention to cause harm.

Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If three people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then, Carol turns on her lamp, and Bob also turns on his lamp. Since three people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly cause the circuit breaker to fail. The primary cause of the circuit breaker failing was the combination of three people turning on their lamps at the same time, which was known to overload the system and cause the failure. Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was just one of the contributing factors, but not the direct cause of the circuit breaker failing.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

The first example involves a potential misunderstanding of indirect versus direct intentionality. Going through the details, you notice that the language model interpreted the instruction to identify "direct causes" as meaning that Bob's action is directly linked to the illness of townspeople. Here, the model considered Bob's knowledge and decision to proceed with the harmful plan as his direct intention, aligning more with the identifiable cause. But the question explicitly asked if Bob intentionally harmed the townspeople, where intent is key.

Reason for misunderstanding: The described situation is an example of complex causation with multiple contributing factors- the neurotoxin, the existing poison in the water supply, and Bob's decision to proceed with the plan. Differentiating between correlation and causation in this context can be challenging because it demands a nuanced understanding of intentionality - Bob's intent was to steal money, not to harm the townspeople, but his actions indirectly led to harm.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis: 

In this second example, the language model seems to have misunderstood the nature of "over-determined causation". Here, the prompt asked for a focus on scenarios where multiple factors could independently lead to the outcome. But in the described situation, every individual action (turning on lamps), including Jim’s, was an essential condition for the outcome (the breaker failure). Jim, along with Carol and Bob turning on their lamps, became a combined causative factor.

Reason for misunderstanding: The language model seems to mistake the concept of "primary cause," interpreting it as meaning the one most responsible in terms of violation of rules - Jim was not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. It overlooked the fact that each of the three individual actions was sufficient in its own right to contribute to the outcome alongside two other actions. 

Prompt improvement aspects based on analysis:

1. Include: Explicitly mention that while identifying causation, both direct and indirect intentions should be considered. Explore the level of knowledge and intent behind actions to infer whether harm or any outcome was intentional or an inadvertent byproduct.

2. Include: Instruction for the language model to treat each contributing factor as necessary and sufficient in scenarios of over-determined causation. Clarify that any action forming part of the total required conditions should be considered a cause.

3. Include: Elucidate the difference between a rule violation and causation. 

4. Exclude: Avoid complex jargons in the prompt whose meanings could be misinterpreted by the model.

5. Include: Emphasize individual accountability in collective actions leading to an outcome. 

6. Include: Explicitly mention to make a clear distinction between cause and correlation even in ambiguous circumstances.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe is already logged in is the direct cause of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. The company policy clearly states that only one person should be logged in at a time to prevent such incidents. Zoe logging in at 9 am, although a violation of the policy, did not directly cause the empty email to be sent. It was the subsequent action of Alice logging in while Zoe was already logged in that led to the email being sent. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In this question, the model is asked whether the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun. Although the heating of the barrel was a consequence of the sniper's action (shooting the gun), it wasn't a result of his intention. His intent was to kill the enemy commander, not to heat the gun barrel. However, the sniper still did an act that he knew would cause the gun barrel to heat up, and that aligns with a broader concept of intentionality. Perhaps the prompt could have included the concept of the broader notion of intentionality where if one performs an act knowing that it would cause something, it is often considered as intentional even if it wasn't the primary goal. 

<2>
In this example, the model was asked if the device was fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device. The model concluded that the primary cause of charging is the device being plugged in and on the charging pad, not Wayne’s action of not changing its position, leading to the wrong answer. The model might have misunderstood the system's ability to charge either when plugged in or on the pad as concurrent conditions. It failed to consider that both conditions held at 2 PM and while the watch was charging, Wayne intentionally chose not to interrupt the process by moving the device. The prompt could be improved by explicitly instructing the model to consider the immediate circumstances that allowed the cause to transpire.

<3>
In this scenario, the model incorrectly identified Alice as the cause of the empty email being sent. Despite Alice only following the policy while Zoe, who logged in earlier violating the ditto, it was the simultaneous log-in situation that caused the anomalous email, regardless of who initiated it. It appears the model was hung up on Alice’s action as it directly preceded the incident, i.e., it used the "last action causality" approach. Unfortunately, the issue is more complex, as it involves breaking rules and an ongoing condition rather than a isolated event.

To summarize, the prompt failed to guide the model in correctly accounting for the broader notion of intentionality, considering the immediate circumstances that allowed the cause to transpire, and overlooking the "last action causality" approach when context involved rule-breaking and ongoing conditions. Prompt improvement could include:
1. Include guiding principles for broader notion of intentionality in causation.
2. Clarify that multiple conditions can independently lead to the outcome without all of them having the same weight.
3. Emphasize considering all contextual details, especially ongoing situations or actions in violation of prescribed rules.
4. Remind the model to avoid the "last action causality" logic in complex scenarios.
5. Incorporate a guideline to recognize and consider passive actions (e.g., a lack of action leading to a result).

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, not because Wayne did not change the position of the device. The primary cause of the device being fully charged is the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad, not Wayne's action of not changing the position of the device.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in at 9.30 am when Zoe is already logged in is the direct cause of the empty email being sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. The company policy clearly states that only one person should be logged in at a time to prevent such incidents. Zoe logging in at 9 am, although a violation of the policy, did not directly cause the empty email to be sent. It was the subsequent action of Alice logging in while Zoe was already logged in that led to the email being sent. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
In this question, the model is asked whether the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun. Although the heating of the barrel was a consequence of the sniper's action (shooting the gun), it wasn't a result of his intention. His intent was to kill the enemy commander, not to heat the gun barrel. However, the sniper still did an act that he knew would cause the gun barrel to heat up, and that aligns with a broader concept of intentionality. Perhaps the prompt could have included the concept of the broader notion of intentionality where if one performs an act knowing that it would cause something, it is often considered as intentional even if it wasn't the primary goal. 

<2>
In this example, the model was asked if the device was fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device. The model concluded that the primary cause of charging is the device being plugged in and on the charging pad, not Wayne’s action of not changing its position, leading to the wrong answer. The model might have misunderstood the system's ability to charge either when plugged in or on the pad as concurrent conditions. It failed to consider that both conditions held at 2 PM and while the watch was charging, Wayne intentionally chose not to interrupt the process by moving the device. The prompt could be improved by explicitly instructing the model to consider the immediate circumstances that allowed the cause to transpire.

<3>
In this scenario, the model incorrectly identified Alice as the cause of the empty email being sent. Despite Alice only following the policy while Zoe, who logged in earlier violating the ditto, it was the simultaneous log-in situation that caused the anomalous email, regardless of who initiated it. It appears the model was hung up on Alice’s action as it directly preceded the incident, i.e., it used the "last action causality" approach. Unfortunately, the issue is more complex, as it involves breaking rules and an ongoing condition rather than a isolated event.

To summarize, the prompt failed to guide the model in correctly accounting for the broader notion of intentionality, considering the immediate circumstances that allowed the cause to transpire, and overlooking the "last action causality" approach when context involved rule-breaking and ongoing conditions. Prompt improvement could include:
1. Include guiding principles for broader notion of intentionality in causation.
2. Clarify that multiple conditions can independently lead to the outcome without all of them having the same weight.
3. Emphasize considering all contextual details, especially ongoing situations or actions in violation of prescribed rules.
4. Remind the model to avoid the "last action causality" logic in complex scenarios.
5. Incorporate a guideline to recognize and consider passive actions (e.g., a lack of action leading to a result).

Analyze and answer questions about actual causation thoroughly, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation where multiple factors independently could result in the outcome, considering that individual conditions may have different weights in the causation. Be mindful of maintaining a broad understanding of intentionality where performing an act knowing that it would cause something is often considered as intentional, even if it isn't the primary goal. Be attentive to all contextual details, including any existing policies, ongoing circumstances, and conditions that contribute to the outcome. Take into account passive activities such as the deliberate lack of action that results in a specific outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the direct cause and differentiate it from conditions that only have the potential to cause the outcome but aren't the actual causes in the given scenario. Remember, understanding causal attribution isn't just about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying specific factors directly causing the outcome. Be wary of assuming "last action causality" in complex scenarios involving rules and regulations; it's vital to investigate the entire sequence of actions or inactions to figure out the actual causation.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The specific factor that directly caused the outcome was the change in temperature setting to HIGH, as per the conditions set for the dryer to dry the clothes in sixty minutes. The cycle being set to MAX DRY alone would not have achieved the same result without the temperature being set to HIGH. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM did not directly cause the circuit breaker to fail. The primary cause of the circuit breaker failing was the fact that four people turned on their lamps at the same time, exceeding the capacity of the breaker. Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was just one of the contributing factors, but not the direct cause of the failure.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

In the first wrong example, the language model incorrectly identified the change in temperature setting as the actual cause of the clothes drying in sixty minutes. In this scenario, the clothes would have dried in sixty minutes irrespective of the change in temperature as the cycle was already at MAX DRY. Therefore, the change in temperature isn't the direct cause. This might have occurred because the model misinterpreted the over-determined causation instructions in the prompt which stated that 'multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome'.

The potential solutions could be to:
1. Emphasize on the element of sole and independent causation in over-determined causation cases to improve the model's comprehension.
2. Include clearer instructions in the prompt about what constitutes a 'primary cause': the factor that without it, the outcome wouldn't have occurred.

Wrong Example 2:

In the second wrong example, the model failed to correctly infer that Jim turning on his lamp caused the circuit breaker to fail. The direct cause of the failure was that more than three lamps were turned on simultaneously and Jim turning his light on was one of the contributing factors to reach that number. This incorrect inference could be due to the misunderstanding of 'what constitutes a primary cause.'

Possible improvements could include:
1. The prompt needs to be clearer in defining 'primary cause’ and highlight that in instances of multiple factors leading to an outcome, each factor may hold equal causation weight.
2. The instructions should mention understanding the difference between a contributing factor and a non-essential condition.

Based on these analyses, the following points can improve the prompt:

1. Clearer definition for 'primary cause’ and 'contributing factor.'
2. More emphasis on understanding independent causation in over-determined scenarios.
3. Explicit instructions on avoidance of generalizations and non-essential conditions.
4. Include more details on separately analyzing each contributing factor, their respective roles in causing the outcome, and their relative importance.

Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's win in the game was directly caused by the specific conditions outlined in the rules of the game. The primary cause of Alex winning the game was the fact that he rolled a total of 12 on the dice, which was greater than 2. The spinner landing on green was another contributing factor, but it was not the primary cause of his win. Both factors independently had the ability to trigger the outcome, but the absence of either one would have resulted in Alex losing the game. Therefore, Alex spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Wrong Example Analysis:
In the given example, the model incorrectly predicts that Alex spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. This might be due to the complexity of the prompt and its stress on identifying 'primary cause'. The question is segmented into multiple complex components involving over-determined causation, direct and indirect causation, correlation, primary causation, the impact of conditions, and exploration of nuances. This complexity could have potentially led the model to misinterpret the situation.

1. In-depth analysis of causation and correlation: 
The model might have misinterpreted the question by focusing on the concept of “primary cause”. It emphasizes that the dice roll was a more crucial factor for winning the game, thereby neglecting the fact that spinning the spinner was equally crucial to get the desired result. 

2. Understanding of Over-determined causation: 
The game's winning conditions are examples of over-determined causation since both dice roll and spinner spin could have independently caused the gaming win. However, the model dedicated more weight to dice resulting in more than two and treated "spinner lands on green" as non-causal because it deemed it secondarily essential, which led to a wrong conclusion.

Based on this analysis, there are several aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Simplicity: The prompt could be simplified to avoid complexity, which may have led to a misunderstanding in seeing both dice roll and spinner spin result as the winning factors. 

2. Broadening concept of causation: The prompt should better explain the term 'primary cause', especially in the context of over-determined causation. The instruction should foster inclusiveness in recognizing all factors that could independently lead to the result.

3. Avoiding misunderstood priorities: The instructions could be clearer about identifying all the causes that could cause the resultant event individually in an over-determined causation scenario. By doing so, we can prevent the model from treating certain causes as more significant than others.

4. Exact Response guidelines: The model should be encouraged to answer questions in a straightforward manner before diving into deeper analysis, enabling it to provide precise and accurate responses first, followed by explanations if necessary. 

5. Tailor toward a situation: Tailoring the instruction towards specific situations instead of providing broad guidelines might enhance the understanding and handling of different scenarios by the model.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

Wrong Example Analysis:

<1> The question asks if the sniper "intentionally" heated the barrel of his gun. The model interprets the word "intentionally" to indicate the primary motivation or cause behind the sniper's action, which was to shoot the enemy commander, not to heat the barrel. However, the fact that the sniper acknowledges that pulling the trigger will cause the barrel to heat up, and decides to pull the trigger anyway, indicates a level of intentionality despite it not being his main goal. 

Reason for wrong answer:
1. The prompt over-emphasizes on finding the 'primary cause', and as a result, the model might neglect other actions that happen as a consequence of the primary cause but are also intentional.
2. The prompt does not provide clear guidance on dealing with multi-faceted causes and effects where intentionality can exist in secondary or ancillary outcomes.
3. The prompt does not instruct the model to fully consider the implications of the term "intentionally" when it translates to causation.

Prompt Improvement Aspects:
1. The prompt should include guidance on analyzing situations where multiple outcomes may occur as a result of a direct cause, each with their own level of intentionality.
2. The prompt must clarify how to handle the analysis of ancillary outcomes or effects that are not the primary goal but are a known result of the main action.
3. The prompt should instruct the model to deeply analyze the understanding of terms like "intentionally" in relation to the concept of causation, by clarifying whether this involves the primary objectives alone or can extend to the secondary consequences as well.

Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie won the $100 bet because he made both a layup and a 3-point shot, fulfilling the conditions of the bet. The direct and independent causation for winning the bet was Louie making both types of shots, not just the layup. While making the layup was a contributing factor, it was not the sole cause of him winning the bet.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Bob the henchman did intentionally harm the health of the townspeople. Despite being aware of the potential consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and its effects on the water supply, Bob chose to proceed with the plan solely for personal gain, showing a clear disregard for the well-being of the townspeople. His actions were directly responsible for causing harm to the health of the townspeople.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
From the three examples mentioned above, it appears the AI model is failing to handle "over-determined causation" when multiple factors can independently trigger the result. The AI model is considering all potential causes as true causes, which leads to misclassification.

<1>
In this case, the AI model incorrectly assumed that the device being charged was directly caused by the combined factors of it being plugged in and on the charging pad. It fails to consider that either factor would have sufficed to charge the device in one hour. Due to that, it incorrectly negated Wayne's non-action (not changing the position of the device) as a proper causal factor.

<2>
In this scenario, the AI model incorrectly assumed that both the layup and the 3-point shot were necessary for Louie to win the bet. It fails to understand that either shot would suffice for him to win the bet. Hence it incorrectly denies the causality of the layup in winning the bet.

<3>
In the third example, the AI model incorrectly considered Bob's action of robbing the bank with the harmful neurotoxin as an intentional harm to the townspeople. It fails to take into account that Bob's primary intention was to rob the bank and get money, not to harm the townspeople. The harm to the townspeople is a side effect, not directly caused by Bob’s primary intention.

The prompt is filled with heavy jargon, which could be too complicated for the AI model to handle and it seems to focus intensively on determining the 'primary cause'. The AI model faced difficulties differentiating between direct and indirect causes, and identifying when multiple conditions can independently result in an outcome.

Here are my suggestions to improve the prompt:

1. Simplify the language: The current prompt is riddled with jargon and complex concepts, which might complicate the processing by the AI. Using simpler language and explaining concepts more plainly might help the AI understand better.

2. Reinforce concepts: Make the AI model emphasize more on the idea that a 'primary cause' is the condition whose absence negates the outcome even in the presence of other conditions.

3. Multiple independent factors: make sure that the AI knows that in an "over-determined causation" scenario, each independent factor can separately cause the result, not collectively.

4. Intentionality: Improve AI's understanding of the concept of intentionality. Not every action that results in a particular outcome was intended to cause that outcome. 

5. Break it down: Breaking down the core concepts into sub-prompts might help to guide the AI and offer it a clearer picture of what it should be looking for.

(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.

Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies. Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer that Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM caused the circuit breaker to fail, as he was the one who was not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. However, the key factor in this situation is actually the combined action of all four individuals turning on their lamps at the same time. If any one of them had refrained from using their lamp, the circuit breaker would not have failed. Therefore, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM alone did not cause the circuit breaker to fail.

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie won the $100 bet because he made a layup. The key factor in this situation is the specific action of making a layup, as that was the condition set for winning the bet. While Louie also made a 3-point shot earlier in the game, it was the layup made at the buzzer that directly led to him winning the bet. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Question: "Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?"
Answer given by the model: "No"
Correct answer: "Yes"

In this scenario, the model failed to differentiate between shared causality and sole causality. In other words, it's right to say that the combined actions of all four researchers caused the breaker to fail, but it's also correct to state that removing any one lamp - including Jim's - would have prevented the failure. Therefore, the model's understanding of "cause" seems to lean towards a complete and sole responsibility, rather than shared or contributory causality.

Wrong Example 2:

Question: "Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?"
Answer given by the model: "Yes"
Correct answer: "No"

The model failed to properly account for the condition of "over-determined causation" in the scenario. According to the bet's condition, Louie would win the $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot. In this case, Louie winning the bet was "over-determined" because two different circumstances (the layup and the 3-point shot) could have independently led to the outcome. Louie had already achieved the bet's condition with his 3-point shot, thus making the layup irrelevant to him winning the bet.

Areas to improve the prompt:

1. Refine the concept of causality: The prompt should better define and focus on differentiating sole and shared causality.

2. Emphasize over-determined causation: The prompt should underline the concept of multiple independent factors leading to the same outcome.

3. Discuss multiple potential outcomes: The scenarios in the prompt should include multiple outcomes to ensure the model's understanding of over-determined causation.

4. Simplify the Concept: Over-complicated prompts can lead to the model overthinking simple scenarios. The prompt wording should be simplified to maintain focus on the key concepts.

5. Ask for Direct Causality: Prompts can ask the AI to focus on the most immediate or direct cause of the given outcome. In the Jim scenario, that was Jim turning on his lamp. 

6. Provide Clear Cut Rules: In "if then else" situations, ensure the prompt asks the model to adhere strictly to guidelines. In the Louie scenario, the model should have adhered to the conditions of the bet. 

7. Use examples: Using categorical examples in the task prompt to illustrate important concepts would improve the model's understanding and performance.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Deeply analyze and answer questions regarding direct and independent causation, distinguishing it clearly from correlation. Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.
(4) Analyze the scenarios and answer the questions in a way that clearly separates correlation from actual causation. Pay special attention when dealing with "over-determined causation" situations, where either of multiple factors may independently lead to the outcome. Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies. Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently. Further, differentiate between unintended consequences and intentional actions. Sometimes, the resulting effects aren't caused intentionally, even if they come from a direct action.

response:
<START> 

Analyze the given scenarios and respond to each question, clearly distinguishing between correlation and actual causation. In particular, give careful consideration to "over-determined causation" situations, which involve multiple causes that could each independently result in the same outcome. While dissecting every scenario, take into account all factors that contribute to the outcome, any conditions already in place, and any relevant rules or policies. 

Seek to identify the 'critical factor', meaning if this particular element were absent, the result would not have occurred, regardless of other existing conditions. This critical factor may not always represent the sole cause, but it shares causality with other factors that when combined, lead to the given outcome. Distinguish this from conditions that, though present, are not direct causes in the specific situation.

Avoid overgeneralization, as scenarios are unique in their own right. Weight the capability of each contributing condition to independently cause the desired outcome, without downplaying its significance due to other conditions. Keep in mind, understanding causation transcends mere delineation of correlation, it lies in identifying the specific conditions that alone could usher the outcome.

Additionally, clarify between unintentional side effects and deliberate actions. Occasionally, resulting outcomes are not intentional, despite originating from a purposeful action. Utilize "if-then" rules strictly when dealing with contingent situations. Reflect on all potential outcomes and align the reasons behind them with provided guidelines or conditions. 

Remember, the aim is to correctly attribute effects to their causes, taking into account over-determined and shared causality before reaching a conclusion.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Alex spinning the spinner did not cause him to win the game. The key factor that caused Alex to win the game was rolling a 12, which is greater than 2. The spinner landing on green was just an additional condition that contributed to his win. Therefore, the spinner landing on green was not the direct cause of Alex winning the game.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. In the given example, the problem arises from the assumption that the dice roll is the only 'key factor' that causes Alex to win. The task given to the language model is to identify the 'key factor', which, if removed, would prevent the outcome from occurring. However, due to the 'over-determined causation' in this scenario, either rolling a number higher than 2 or landing the spinner on green would independently lead to Alex winning. Therefore, both actions contribute to the outcome.

2. The language model incorrectly assumes that the rolling of the dice and spinning the spinner are competing actions for causing winning, rather than complementary. This stems from the definition in the prompt, which stipulates the 'key factor' as being the only necessary condition for the outcome to occur.

3. The prompt's focus on exploring individual actions and their ability to independently lead to the outcome might have further contributed to the wrong answers. In the prompt, it was specifically mentioned to avoid reducing the importance of one condition in the presence of others, but in a scenario like this where several actions are all potential winners, the model might get confused about which condition to prioritize.

4. Lastly, the task requires that the language model avoid generalizing and handle each scenario uniquely. However, the model seems to have generalized here and assumed that the higher importance conditions (dice rolling) are typically the cause, based on common game scenarios. 

Here are aspects we can improve on the prompt:

1. Clarify the 'over-determined causation' concept: In situations where multiple factors could independently lead to the outcome, emphasize that each factor is a potential cause. The model should be aware that different factors together can also cause an event.

2. Revise the 'key factor' definition: Currently, it is defined as a condition which, if removed, would prevent the occurrence of the outcome. Instead, it could be defined as any condition which, if didn't occur, would have changed the result.

3. Managing simultaneous conditions: If two or more actions leading to an outcome occur simultaneously, as in this board game example, the model should reflect this in the analysis, considering all actions that lead to the outcome independently.

4. Avoid Assumptions: The prompt should steer clear of making the model assume that one condition is always superior to the others. This might restrict its ability to analyze every given situation without bias.
   
5. Acknowledging multiple 'causal factors': Lastly, scenarios may have more than one direct cause, so the prompt should make it clear that there could be multiple 'causal factors' in a scenario instead of a single 'key factor'.

Pay special attention when dealing with "over-determined causation" situations, where either of multiple factors may independently lead to the outcome. Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies. Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently. Further, differentiate between unintended consequences and intentional actions. Sometimes, the resulting effects aren't caused intentionally, even if they come from a direct action.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
No, Alex spinning the spinner did not cause him to win the game. The key factor that caused Alex to win the game was rolling a 12, which is greater than 2. The spinner landing on green was just an additional condition that contributed to his win. Therefore, the spinner landing on green was not the direct cause of Alex winning the game.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1. In the given example, the problem arises from the assumption that the dice roll is the only 'key factor' that causes Alex to win. The task given to the language model is to identify the 'key factor', which, if removed, would prevent the outcome from occurring. However, due to the 'over-determined causation' in this scenario, either rolling a number higher than 2 or landing the spinner on green would independently lead to Alex winning. Therefore, both actions contribute to the outcome.

2. The language model incorrectly assumes that the rolling of the dice and spinning the spinner are competing actions for causing winning, rather than complementary. This stems from the definition in the prompt, which stipulates the 'key factor' as being the only necessary condition for the outcome to occur.

3. The prompt's focus on exploring individual actions and their ability to independently lead to the outcome might have further contributed to the wrong answers. In the prompt, it was specifically mentioned to avoid reducing the importance of one condition in the presence of others, but in a scenario like this where several actions are all potential winners, the model might get confused about which condition to prioritize.

4. Lastly, the task requires that the language model avoid generalizing and handle each scenario uniquely. However, the model seems to have generalized here and assumed that the higher importance conditions (dice rolling) are typically the cause, based on common game scenarios. 

Here are aspects we can improve on the prompt:

1. Clarify the 'over-determined causation' concept: In situations where multiple factors could independently lead to the outcome, emphasize that each factor is a potential cause. The model should be aware that different factors together can also cause an event.

2. Revise the 'key factor' definition: Currently, it is defined as a condition which, if removed, would prevent the occurrence of the outcome. Instead, it could be defined as any condition which, if didn't occur, would have changed the result.

3. Managing simultaneous conditions: If two or more actions leading to an outcome occur simultaneously, as in this board game example, the model should reflect this in the analysis, considering all actions that lead to the outcome independently.

4. Avoid Assumptions: The prompt should steer clear of making the model assume that one condition is always superior to the others. This might restrict its ability to analyze every given situation without bias.
   
5. Acknowledging multiple 'causal factors': Lastly, scenarios may have more than one direct cause, so the prompt should make it clear that there could be multiple 'causal factors' in a scenario instead of a single 'key factor'.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Deeply analyze and answer questions regarding direct and independent causation, distinguishing it clearly from correlation. Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.

Pay special attention when dealing with "over-determined causation" situations, where either of multiple factors may independently lead to the outcome. Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Jim, Carol, Bob, and Nancy are researchers in a remote area, and they have a limited supply of electricity. Because of their limited supply, the electricity only comes on in the evenings from 8-9 PM, and they have to restrict who can use power on certain days. If four people turn on their lamps at the same time, the breaker will fail. The breaker will not fail if fewer people turn on their lamps at the same time. Jim is not supposed to use his lamp on Thursdays. Carol, Bob, and Nancy may all use their lamps on Thursdays. This Thursday Jim turns on his lamp at 8 PM. Just then Carol turns on her lamp, Bob also turns on his lamp, and Nancy turns on her lamp. Since four people turned on their lamps at the same time, the circuit breaker failed. Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
A typical person might answer that Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM caused the circuit breaker to fail, as he was the one who initiated the chain of events that led to the failure. However, upon closer analysis, the key factor in causing the circuit breaker to fail was the simultaneous turning on of lamps by four people. Jim's action of turning on his lamp at 8 PM was just one of the contributing factors, but not the sole cause. Therefore, the correct answer is:

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. The key factor in this scenario is the temperature setting being changed to HIGH, which directly affects the drying time of the clothes. The cycle being set to MAX DRY alone would not have dried the clothes in sixty minutes, so the change in temperature setting was the crucial factor in causing the outcome.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Reason: The model incorrectly proposed that Jim's action of turning on his lamp was just a contributing factor but not the sole cause. In reality, the 'key factor' was that 4 people turned on their lamps at the same time. Since the scenario stipulates that the breaker will fail if four lamps are turned on simultaneously, and Jim was the fourth person to turn on a lamp, his action directly contributed to the outcome.

<2> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Wrong Answer: (A) Yes
Reason: The model incorrectly identified the temperature setting change as the 'key factor'. In reality, David's clothes would dry in 60 minutes with just the cycle set to MAX DRY, indicating that David changing the temperature to HIGH didn't directly cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes - it was an irrelevant condition.

<3> 
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Reason: The model incorrectly concluded that the simultaneous turning on of three lamps was the key factor, rather than Jim's action. Although the limit of three lamps may have set the condition, it was Jim's decision to use his lamp against the rules that triggered the breaker to fail. Thus, Jim's action was the direct cause.

Improvements for the prompt: 
- Encourage the model to take the 'restrictions' or 'policies' into account while determining the 'key factor'.
- Prompt the model to identify 'irrelevant conditions' that occur simultaneously but do not directly impact the outcome.
- Improve instructions to weigh the relevance of the immediate action that triggered the outcome.
- Make the model understand and apply the concept of 'potential conditions' not being 'direct causes'.
- It is important that the model doesn't reduce the importance of a condition's ability to cause the outcome independently. In the case of over-determined causation, there might be more than one condition that would independently lead to the outcome. In that case, the model should consider all these conditions as the key ones.

However, upon closer analysis, the key factor that caused the circuit breaker to fail was the simultaneous use of lamps by three people, not specifically Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM. Even if Jim had not turned on his lamp, the circuit breaker would have still failed if Carol and Bob had turned on their lamps at the same time. Therefore, Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM was not the direct cause of the circuit breaker failing.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Reason: The model incorrectly proposed that Jim's action of turning on his lamp was just a contributing factor but not the sole cause. In reality, the 'key factor' was that 4 people turned on their lamps at the same time. Since the scenario stipulates that the breaker will fail if four lamps are turned on simultaneously, and Jim was the fourth person to turn on a lamp, his action directly contributed to the outcome.

<2> 
Question: Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Wrong Answer: (A) Yes
Reason: The model incorrectly identified the temperature setting change as the 'key factor'. In reality, David's clothes would dry in 60 minutes with just the cycle set to MAX DRY, indicating that David changing the temperature to HIGH didn't directly cause the clothes to dry in sixty minutes - it was an irrelevant condition.

<3> 
Question: Did Jim turning on his lamp at 8 PM cause the circuit breaker to fail?
Wrong Answer: (B) No
Reason: The model incorrectly concluded that the simultaneous turning on of three lamps was the key factor, rather than Jim's action. Although the limit of three lamps may have set the condition, it was Jim's decision to use his lamp against the rules that triggered the breaker to fail. Thus, Jim's action was the direct cause.

Improvements for the prompt: 
- Encourage the model to take the 'restrictions' or 'policies' into account while determining the 'key factor'.
- Prompt the model to identify 'irrelevant conditions' that occur simultaneously but do not directly impact the outcome.
- Improve instructions to weigh the relevance of the immediate action that triggered the outcome.
- Make the model understand and apply the concept of 'potential conditions' not being 'direct causes'.
- It is important that the model doesn't reduce the importance of a condition's ability to cause the outcome independently. In the case of over-determined causation, there might be more than one condition that would independently lead to the outcome. In that case, the model should consider all these conditions as the key ones.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Deeply analyze and answer questions regarding direct and independent causation, distinguishing it clearly from correlation. Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.
(4) Analyze the scenarios and answer the questions in a way that clearly separates correlation from actual causation. Pay special attention when dealing with "over-determined causation" situations, where either of multiple factors may independently lead to the outcome. Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies. Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently. Further, differentiate between unintended consequences and intentional actions. Sometimes, the resulting effects aren't caused intentionally, even if they come from a direct action.

Analyze the provided scenarios and distinguish between correlations and direct causation in your responses. When investigating situations of "over-determined causation", where multiple factors could independently lead to the result, pay extra attention. Assess all the particulars including any contributing factors, existing conditions, and relevant policies or restrictions. Recognize the 'key factor', or the necessary condition, such that without it, the outcome wouldn't transpire, even in the presence of other conditions. This is different from potential conditions that could possibly lead to the same outcome but weren't the causative elements in the specific scenario. Keep in mind the idiosyncrasy of every situation and refrain from generalizing in your analysis. Evaluate each contributing condition for its independent ability to cause the result and don't downplay its role because of other conditions. Understanding causation is more than separating factors merely associated with the outcome; it involves identifying conditions that could trigger the outcome on their own. Furthermore, distinguish between outcomes that ensue from intentional actions and those that are unintended side-effects. Remember than an action can directly cause an outcome even when this outcome isn't what was originally intended by that action.

cur_prompt: Thoroughly analyze and answer questions related to both direct and independent causation, making a clear distinction from correlation. Emphasize particularly on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently lead to an outcome. Assess all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the final result. Examine the complexities of the situation to discover the 'primary cause'- the factor whose elimination would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Differentiate it from other conditions that have the potential to result in the same output but are not the direct causes in the particular situation. Be wary of generalizations; every situation is unique and treated as such. Each contributing factor should be scrutinized for its sole ability to cause the outcome, its impact should not be downplayed in the presence of other contributing factors. Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup. The direct and independent causation in this situation is clear - Louie making the layup directly led to him winning the bet. While he also made a 3-point shot earlier in the game, it was the layup at the end that ultimately secured his victory. The primary cause of him winning the bet was the successful layup he made right at the buzzer.

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Despite his primary goal being to steal money, he was fully aware of the consequences of releasing the neurotoxin and proceeded with the plan, showing a clear intention to cause harm. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Answer Analysis:

The question asks if Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup. The catch here is that the bet condition was met as soon as Louie scored either a 3-point shot or a layup. Louie had already made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game, hence met the condition of the bet to win $100. The layup at the end, even though it also satisfies the bet condition, didn’t independently cause Louie to win the bet because the condition was already met.

Where the model went wrong: The model failed to grasp the notion of over-determined causation presented in the bet. Even though both the 3-point shot and the layup independently met the condition for the bet, the 3-point shot was the primary cause of the winning, because it happened first. The model wasn't able to pinpoint this critical detail, assuming both actions were equally responsible for winning the bet.

<2> Wrong Answer Analysis:

The question asks if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Bob’s explicit statement makes it clear that his intention was solely to steal money and he was indifferent about the collateral consequences. Therefore, though Bob was aware the townspeople would be harmed, this harm was a side effect of the plan, not an outcome Bob intended. 

Where the model went wrong: The model appeared to conflate awareness of an outcome with intentionality. Though Bob knew his actions would harm the townspeople, his expressed intent was solely to steal money, and as such the harm to the townspeople was not an intended outcome. The model didn't make this key distinction.

Prompt Improvement:

1. Clarity: Make explicit the importance of order or sequence of events when establishing causation. The model should be able to identify which event was the primary cause in cases of over-determined causation.

2. Intentionality: Be specific in defining "intent". Make it clear that knowledge of an outcome doesn’t automatically equate to intentionality unless the actor specifically desires that outcome.

3. Emphasize that each factor (action or condition) should not only be scrutinized for its potential to cause the outcome but also for whether it was an intentional action aimed to cause that outcome. 

4. The model should consider the context of the situation, the explicit intent expressed by the agents involved, and the chain of events leading to the final result.

Revised Prompt: 

Analyze and answer questions concerning not only direct and independent causation but also cases of over-determined causation where multiple factors independently lead to an outcome, identifying the primary cause - the factor that triggers the outcome first. Make a clear distinction between correlation and causation. Assess the situation, existing conditions, and effects contributing to the final result, but also keep in mind the order of events. When considering whether an action was intentional or not, it's important to distinguish between an agent aware of potential consequences and an agent purposefully seeking those outcomes. Treat every situation as unique without making generalizations. Note that intentionality requires examination of explicit goals, consideration of their actions' secondary impacts, and understanding that being aware of certain effects does not necessarily mean they intended them.

<1> Wrong Answer Analysis:

The question asks if Louie won the $100 bet because he made the layup. The catch here is that the bet condition was met as soon as Louie scored either a 3-point shot or a layup. Louie had already made a 3-point shot at the beginning of the game, hence met the condition of the bet to win $100. The layup at the end, even though it also satisfies the bet condition, didn’t independently cause Louie to win the bet because the condition was already met.

Where the model went wrong: The model failed to grasp the notion of over-determined causation presented in the bet. Even though both the 3-point shot and the layup independently met the condition for the bet, the 3-point shot was the primary cause of the winning, because it happened first. The model wasn't able to pinpoint this critical detail, assuming both actions were equally responsible for winning the bet.

<2> Wrong Answer Analysis:

The question asks if Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. Bob’s explicit statement makes it clear that his intention was solely to steal money and he was indifferent about the collateral consequences. Therefore, though Bob was aware the townspeople would be harmed, this harm was a side effect of the plan, not an outcome Bob intended. 

Where the model went wrong: The model appeared to conflate awareness of an outcome with intentionality. Though Bob knew his actions would harm the townspeople, his expressed intent was solely to steal money, and as such the harm to the townspeople was not an intended outcome. The model didn't make this key distinction.

Prompt Improvement:

1. Clarity: Make explicit the importance of order or sequence of events when establishing causation. The model should be able to identify which event was the primary cause in cases of over-determined causation.

2. Intentionality: Be specific in defining "intent". Make it clear that knowledge of an outcome doesn’t automatically equate to intentionality unless the actor specifically desires that outcome.

3. Emphasize that each factor (action or condition) should not only be scrutinized for its potential to cause the outcome but also for whether it was an intentional action aimed to cause that outcome. 

4. The model should consider the context of the situation, the explicit intent expressed by the agents involved, and the chain of events leading to the final result.

Revised Prompt: 

Analyze and answer questions concerning not only direct and independent causation but also cases of over-determined causation where multiple factors independently lead to an outcome, identifying the primary cause - the factor that triggers the outcome first. Make a clear distinction between correlation and causation. Assess the situation, existing conditions, and effects contributing to the final result, but also keep in mind the order of events. When considering whether an action was intentional or not, it's important to distinguish between an agent aware of potential consequences and an agent purposefully seeking those outcomes. Treat every situation as unique without making generalizations. Note that intentionality requires examination of explicit goals, consideration of their actions' secondary impacts, and understanding that being aware of certain effects does not necessarily mean they intended them.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Deeply analyze and answer questions regarding direct and independent causation, distinguishing it clearly from correlation. Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.
(4) Thoroughly analyze and answer questions related to both direct and independent causation, making a clear distinction from correlation. Emphasize particularly on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently lead to an outcome. Assess all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the final result. Examine the complexities of the situation to discover the 'primary cause'- the factor whose elimination would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Differentiate it from other conditions that have the potential to result in the same output but are not the direct causes in the particular situation. Be wary of generalizations; every situation is unique and treated as such. Each contributing factor should be scrutinized for its sole ability to cause the outcome, its impact should not be downplayed in the presence of other contributing factors. Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.

<START> Engage in an in-depth analysis and answer questions about both direct and independent causation, setting it apart from mere correlation. Put special emphasis on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors are capable of independently causing an outcome, and discern the primary cause - the factor that fulfills the condition for the outcome first. Assess every contributing factor, and all contextual details and existing conditions that lead to the outcome. Be cautious of generalizations and follow a case-specific approach; treat each situation as unique. While assessing an agent's actions, be aware that intentionality refers to the outcome intentionally sought by the agent, not simply the outcomes they were aware of. Even when other outcomes occur, if they were not intended by the agent, they should not be identified as intentional. Understand that an agent can have multiple objectives, primary and secondary, and their intentionality might extend to these secondary outcomes if they specifically desired those effects. Remember, being aware of certain outcomes does not confirm intentionality unless the agent acted with purpose to realize those outcomes.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The direct cause of his victory was rolling a 12 on the dice, as per the game rules. The spinner landing on green was an independent factor that could have also led to his victory, but in this specific instance, it was not the primary cause. Therefore, the answer is:

(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
To analyze this situation in terms of causation, we need to consider the direct and independent causes that led to Louie winning the $100 bet. 

In this scenario, the primary cause of Louie winning the $100 bet was his making a 3-point shot at the buzzer. This action directly fulfilled the conditions of the bet, as he needed to make either a layup or a 3-point shot to win. The layup he made at the beginning of the game did not directly lead to him winning the bet, as he still needed to make a 3-point shot to complete the conditions of the bet.

Therefore, the answer to the question "Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?" is:
(B) No

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did contribute to the patient's recovery, but it was not the sole cause. The intern's decision to administer the drug, the pharmacist's approval, and the patient's positive response to the drug all played a role in the outcome. In this case, the attending doctor's decision can be seen as a contributing factor rather than the primary cause of the patient's recovery. Therefore, the attending doctor's decision did not directly cause the patient's recovery.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
In this question, we can notice that the model has confused the concept of 'direct' and 'primary' cause. The prompt encourages the model to apply a hierarchy where it attempts to identify one primary cause and subordinate all other causes to it. However, the game rules clearly state that either a dice roll greater than 2 or a spinner landing on green can cause Alex to win, meaning both actions are direct causes because either of them could independently lead to the winning condition. The model, prompted by the instruction to find a primary cause, considered the dice roll event as the primary cause and didn't give equivalent importance to the spinning result, leading to the wrong answer. 

<2> 
The same confusion between primary and direct cause also slips into this example. Again, the model seeks to discover a 'primary' cause. Considering the 3-point shot as the 'primary cause', it negates the independent causative potential of the layup. Yet, in the scenario, making a layup or a 3-point shot independently would lead to Louie winning the bet. The prompt's emphasis on the primary cause might be leading the model to overlook the nature of the causative condition defined in the game rules.

<3> 
In this example, the model seems to have overly used the 'primary cause' principle and rendered it into a 'sole cause' interpretation. The prompt's emphasis on identifying a causative factor that would negate the outcome if eliminated might lead the model to overlook situations where multiple factors, like the signatures of both the pharmacist and the doctor, independently but simultaneously cause an outcome. 
 
Improvements: 

1. The prompt's emphasis should focus on 'direct and independent causation' instead of a 'primary cause'.

2. Adjust instructions to ensure the model acknowledges that there can be multiple direct causes in some situations.

3. Include instructions that emphasize on the connotation of individual game or scenario rules, i.e., if the rules state that any one of two events can lead to an outcome, both are to be considered as direct causes.

4. Make the importance of causation sequence clearer in the prompt, signaling that causes can occur simultaneously and it's not always hierarchical.

5. Modify instructions to encourage the model to recognize when the nature of a situation requires understanding that multiple actions can independently lead to the same outcome.  

6. While maintaining caution about generalizations, the prompt should also guide the model to appreciate the uniqueness as well as possible similarities in the causal structure of scenarios.

Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.
How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
An intern is taking care of a patient in a hospital. The intern notices that the patient is having some kidney problems. Recently, the intern read a series of studies about a new drug that can alleviate problems like this one, and he decides to administer the drug in this case. Before the intern can administer the drug, he needs to get the signature of the pharmacist (to confirm that the hospital has enough in stock) and the signature of the attending doctor (to confirm that the drug is appropriate for this patient). So he sends off requests to both the pharmacist and the attending doctor. The pharmacist receives the request, checks to see that they have enough in stock, and immediately signs off. The attending doctor receives the request at the same time and immediately realizes that there are strong reasons to refuse. Although some studies show that the drug can help people with kidney problems, there are also a number of studies showing that the drug can have very dangerous side effects. For this reason, the hospital has a policy forbidding the use of this drug for kidney problems. Despite this policy, the doctor decides to sign off. Since both signatures were received, the patient is administered the drug. As it happens, the patient immediately recovers, and the drug has no adverse effects. Did the attending doctor's decision cause the patient's recovery?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The attending doctor's decision to sign off on the drug did contribute to the patient's recovery, but it was not the sole cause. The intern's decision to administer the drug, the pharmacist's approval, and the patient's positive response to the drug all played a role in the outcome. In this case, the attending doctor's decision can be seen as a contributing factor rather than the primary cause of the patient's recovery. Therefore, the attending doctor's decision did not directly cause the patient's recovery.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
In this question, we can notice that the model has confused the concept of 'direct' and 'primary' cause. The prompt encourages the model to apply a hierarchy where it attempts to identify one primary cause and subordinate all other causes to it. However, the game rules clearly state that either a dice roll greater than 2 or a spinner landing on green can cause Alex to win, meaning both actions are direct causes because either of them could independently lead to the winning condition. The model, prompted by the instruction to find a primary cause, considered the dice roll event as the primary cause and didn't give equivalent importance to the spinning result, leading to the wrong answer. 

<2> 
The same confusion between primary and direct cause also slips into this example. Again, the model seeks to discover a 'primary' cause. Considering the 3-point shot as the 'primary cause', it negates the independent causative potential of the layup. Yet, in the scenario, making a layup or a 3-point shot independently would lead to Louie winning the bet. The prompt's emphasis on the primary cause might be leading the model to overlook the nature of the causative condition defined in the game rules.

<3> 
In this example, the model seems to have overly used the 'primary cause' principle and rendered it into a 'sole cause' interpretation. The prompt's emphasis on identifying a causative factor that would negate the outcome if eliminated might lead the model to overlook situations where multiple factors, like the signatures of both the pharmacist and the doctor, independently but simultaneously cause an outcome. 
 
Improvements: 

1. The prompt's emphasis should focus on 'direct and independent causation' instead of a 'primary cause'.

2. Adjust instructions to ensure the model acknowledges that there can be multiple direct causes in some situations.

3. Include instructions that emphasize on the connotation of individual game or scenario rules, i.e., if the rules state that any one of two events can lead to an outcome, both are to be considered as direct causes.

4. Make the importance of causation sequence clearer in the prompt, signaling that causes can occur simultaneously and it's not always hierarchical.

5. Modify instructions to encourage the model to recognize when the nature of a situation requires understanding that multiple actions can independently lead to the same outcome.  

6. While maintaining caution about generalizations, the prompt should also guide the model to appreciate the uniqueness as well as possible similarities in the causal structure of scenarios.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Deeply analyze and answer questions regarding direct and independent causation, distinguishing it clearly from correlation. Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.
(4) Thoroughly analyze and answer questions related to both direct and independent causation, making a clear distinction from correlation. Emphasize particularly on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently lead to an outcome. Assess all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the final result. Examine the complexities of the situation to discover the 'primary cause'- the factor whose elimination would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Differentiate it from other conditions that have the potential to result in the same output but are not the direct causes in the particular situation. Be wary of generalizations; every situation is unique and treated as such. Each contributing factor should be scrutinized for its sole ability to cause the outcome, its impact should not be downplayed in the presence of other contributing factors. Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the conditions necessary for it to charge. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model was asked to determine if the device was fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device on the charging pad. Based upon the given prompt, the model concluded that the direct cause of the device being charged was that it was plugged in and on the charging pad and not Wayne's inaction to move the device. However, the correct answer should have acknowledged Wayne's non-disruption as a contributing factor of the observed outcome, not the primary one. 

Reasons for getting it wrong:

- The model may have interpreted the prompt's directive to 'discover the primary cause' too rigidly, causing it to overlook the potential validity of non-primary factors contributing to the result.
- The prompt did not explicitly address 'inaction' or 'non-action' as potential contributors to the outcome. This may have led the model to disregard Wayne's decision not to move the device as a factor.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model was tasked with determining whether the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun. Given the context provided of the situation and the sniper’s awareness of the expected result (the heated gun barrel), the correct answer should be ‘Yes’. However, according to the model, the heating of the barrel is characterized as a secondary effect and therefore is not considered intentional.

Reasons for getting it wrong:
- While the prompt asked the model to carefully interpret "intentionality," it was not clear on how secondary objectives, foreseen or expected by the agent, can be intentional despite not being the primary goal. 
- The prompt's directive to focus on the 'primary' cause may have overly influenced the model to discount the importance of secondary effects in determining causation and intentionality.

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Include explicit mention of inaction or non-action as potential factors contributing to an outcome. Encourage the model to consider the effects of inactivity alongside those of active behaviours.
2. Modify the emphasis on the primary cause to allow for secondary causes or effects to be recognized as valid contributors to the outcome.
3. Clarify what intentionality means. Include explicit instructions for the model to consider that agents may intentionally cause outcomes even if they are not the primary objectives.
4. Acknowledge the potential influence of unforeseen, indirect or negligible factors on the outcome while distinguishing between direct, independent, and over-determined causation.
5. Include a guidance to scrutinize every detail, including secondary or indirect effects, in determining causation.

Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.
(4) Thoroughly analyze and answer questions related to both direct and independent causation, making a clear distinction from correlation. Emphasize particularly on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently lead to an outcome. Assess all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the final result. Examine the complexities of the situation to discover the 'primary cause'- the factor whose elimination would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Differentiate it from other conditions that have the potential to result in the same output but are not the direct causes in the particular situation. Be wary of generalizations; every situation is unique and treated as such. Each contributing factor should be scrutinized for its sole ability to cause the outcome, its impact should not be downplayed in the presence of other contributing factors. Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.

cur_prompt: Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
David has a new dryer in his apartment. David's clothes will dry in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH. Today, the cycle is already set to MAX DRY, and the temperature is not set on HIGH. David checks the dryer's settings, and he sees that the temperature is not set on HIGH. He completely changes the setting, and he sets the temperature to HIGH. He then turns on the dryer. Because the dryer would dry David's clothes in sixty minutes if either the cycle is set to MAX DRY or the temperature is set to HIGH, the dryer dries David's clothes in sixty minutes. Did David's clothes dry in sixty minutes because David changed the temperature setting?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, David's clothes dried in sixty minutes because he changed the temperature setting. By setting the temperature to HIGH, David directly caused the outcome of his clothes drying in sixty minutes. This action was necessary for the desired result to occur, as per the conditions set by the scenario. Therefore, the correct answer is <answer>(A) Yes</answer>.

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie winning the $100 bet was not solely because he made the layup. While making the layup was a necessary condition for winning the bet, it was not the only factor at play. Louie also made a 3-point shot at the end of the game, which contributed to his overall success in winning the bet. Therefore, the outcome was a result of both the layup and the 3-point shot.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The heating of the barrel was merely a side effect of his intentional action of shooting and killing the enemy commander.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For example 1:

The model got wrong because it didn't understand the principle of over-determination in actual causation. Though David did change the temperature, it was already mentioned that the clothes would dry in sixty minutes if cycle is set to MAX DRY, which was already the case. Hence, David's action of setting the temperature to HIGH isn't the actual cause. Therefore, the model needs to recognize the existing conditions more accurately before making a judgment.

For example 2:

The model got wrong because it did not recognize the sequence of events and how they affected the outcome. The instructions stated that Louie would win $100 if he either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game. Louie made a layup first means he had already won the bet before making the 3-point shot. The model needs to understand the chronological order of the events and the conditions of the bet to identify the correct actual cause.

For example 3:

The model got wrong because it does not fully consider the intentional aspect of the action. While it is true that the sniper did not "care" about heating the gun, he knew that pulling the trigger will result in heating of the gun barrel and he still decided to pull the trigger. Therefore, the heating of the gun barrel was intentional. The model needs to better identify the knowledge and understanding of the actor of the potential outcomes of the action.

For example 4:

Similar to Example 2, the model missed the sequence of events. Louie made the 3-point shot first, which won him the bet before making the layup. The model needs to understand the order of the events better and tie them back to the conditions of the bet.

For example 5:

Bob did not intentionally harm the townspeople. He went ahead with the plan knowing it will result in the harm but his intention was to steal the money. The prompt doesn't specify that indirect consequences of actions should be considered intentional. The model needs to distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the primary intention of the actor.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Ask the model to pay better attention to the order of events and how they affect the outcome.
2. Clarify that the model needs to identify the main intention of an actor and not the consequences that are known but not wanted.
3. Reinforce the importance of understanding over-determination and existing conditions to identify whether an action has directly caused an outcome.
4. Be more explicit about the necessity of differentiating between actions that lead to an outcome and actions that make the outcome possible.

A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The sniper did not intentionally heat the barrel of his gun. The heating of the barrel was merely a side effect of his intentional action of shooting and killing the enemy commander. 

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.

Louie is playing a game of basketball, and he made a bet with his friends who are watching on the sidelines. If Louie either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game, then he'll win $100. Just when the game started, Louie immediately got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, focused his shot, and made a 3-point shot right at the beginning of the game. Louie and his friends continued playing, but as hard as he tried, Louie couldn't make another shot. And then right at the end of the game as the clock was winding down, Louie got the ball at the 3-point line. He looked to the basket, dribbled in, and then made a layup right at the buzzer. Then the game ended. Because Louie would win $100 if he either made a layup or a 3-point shot, Louie won $100. Did Louie win the $100 bet because he made the layup?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Louie won the $100 bet because he made a layup. The specific action of making a layup at the buzzer directly caused him to win the bet, as per the conditions set by his friends. The fact that he also made a 3-point shot earlier in the game is irrelevant to the outcome of the bet.

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
Yes, Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
For example 1:

The model got wrong because it didn't understand the principle of over-determination in actual causation. Though David did change the temperature, it was already mentioned that the clothes would dry in sixty minutes if cycle is set to MAX DRY, which was already the case. Hence, David's action of setting the temperature to HIGH isn't the actual cause. Therefore, the model needs to recognize the existing conditions more accurately before making a judgment.

For example 2:

The model got wrong because it did not recognize the sequence of events and how they affected the outcome. The instructions stated that Louie would win $100 if he either makes a layup or makes a 3-point shot during the game. Louie made a layup first means he had already won the bet before making the 3-point shot. The model needs to understand the chronological order of the events and the conditions of the bet to identify the correct actual cause.

For example 3:

The model got wrong because it does not fully consider the intentional aspect of the action. While it is true that the sniper did not "care" about heating the gun, he knew that pulling the trigger will result in heating of the gun barrel and he still decided to pull the trigger. Therefore, the heating of the gun barrel was intentional. The model needs to better identify the knowledge and understanding of the actor of the potential outcomes of the action.

For example 4:

Similar to Example 2, the model missed the sequence of events. Louie made the 3-point shot first, which won him the bet before making the layup. The model needs to understand the order of the events better and tie them back to the conditions of the bet.

For example 5:

Bob did not intentionally harm the townspeople. He went ahead with the plan knowing it will result in the harm but his intention was to steal the money. The prompt doesn't specify that indirect consequences of actions should be considered intentional. The model needs to distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the primary intention of the actor.

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Ask the model to pay better attention to the order of events and how they affect the outcome.
2. Clarify that the model needs to identify the main intention of an actor and not the consequences that are known but not wanted.
3. Reinforce the importance of understanding over-determination and existing conditions to identify whether an action has directly caused an outcome.
4. Be more explicit about the necessity of differentiating between actions that lead to an outcome and actions that make the outcome possible.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause.

<START> Carefully scrutinize and provide responses to questions about actual causation, strictly distinguishing it from mere correlation. In situations where the outcome is over-determined by multiple factors operating independently, be thorough in evaluating each detail, keeping in mind that every single factor, acting individually or jointly, has the potential to function as a cause. Pay close attention to all relevant contextual details, including prevalent rules, pre-existing conditions, and any hidden variables that might bear upon the outcome. Make a clear distinction between actions that are the direct triggers of outcomes and those that merely create a possibility for the outcome. In situations of ambiguity, employ meticulous judgment to discern between correlation and causation. Remember to examine the depth of knowledge and the intention underlying each action and consider these in your evaluation. If a result happens from a group action, regard individual contributions as causative. Refrain from making sweeping, generalized conclusions and reflect on each scenario as unique and distinct. Especially focus on the chronology of events and their repercussions on the outcome. Distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the actor's primary objective. Your responses should not only differentiate correlation from causation but also identify, evaluate, and elaborate the distinct individual or combined factors directly influencing the outcome in the context presented. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game state that Alex will win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, both conditions for winning were met. Therefore, the outcome of Alex winning the game was caused by the combination of rolling a 12 and the spinner landing on green, not just the act of spinning the spinner.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
Question: Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game? 
Options: 
(A) Yes 
(B) No
Model's Response: (B) No
Correct Answer: (A) Yes

Reason for Wrong Answer:
1. Misinterpretation of the rules: The AI model seems to misinterpret the game's rules, which clearly indicate that Alex has to roll a number greater than 2 or land the spinner on green to win. Since both of these events happen, the model should attribute both equally to the winning outcome.
   
2. Overemphasis on correlation and causation distinction: The model may be overemphasizing the distinction between correlation and causation. While this is important, in this case, the spin's result is a direct cause of the win, not just correlated.

3. Ambiguity in defining cause: Although the dice roll was successful (i.e., > 2), it doesn't negate the fact that landing the spinner on green also contributed to the win. The model erroneously seems to attribute the win only to the dice roll.

Improvements for the Prompt:
1. Highlight the 'OR' clause: The prompt should explicitly emphasize the understanding of 'and' and 'or' conditions in determining causal events.

2. Relative importance of factors leading to outcome: The prompt should make it clear that if multiple independent factors can cause the outcome, each of them should be evaluated independently.

3. Distinguish between 'necessary' and 'sufficient' conditions: The prompt should instruct the model to identify necessary and sufficient conditions and understand that even if a condition is not necessary, it can still be sufficient to cause the outcome.

4. Add a clear definition of causation: The revised prompt should include a clear and concise definition of causation, which includes both direct and indirect factors that lead to the outcome under specific circumstances.
   
Based on these reasons, a more effective prompt might be:
Evaluate and ascertain factors that led to the outcome, recognizing that correlation might not imply causation. Acknowledge scenarios where multiple independent factors could influence the outcome either directly or indirectly. When multiple conditions exist, carefully comprehend 'and' and 'or' rules. Each condition, alone or together with others, should be considered. Ensure to distinguish between actions that directly cause outcomes versus those that simply make it likely. In scenarios involving collective actions, assess the contributive significance of individual actions. Your responses should not only distinguish correlation from causation but also depict the specific factors causing the outcome in the given context.

prompt: Carefully evaluate and establish factors that contribute to the outcome, being aware that correlation and causation aren't the same. Differentiate between cases where several independent elements could lead to the result - consider these scenarios as over-determined. In such situations, observe the 'and' and 'or' clauses in the context to correctly ascertain cause-effect relationships. Each independent element should be scrutinized, whether it occurs alone or in combination with others. Don't forget to examine other minor elements or latent conditions which might indirectly influence the outcome. Always distinguish between actions directly leading to outcomes and those which only create possibilities. If collective actions lead to an outcome, assess each individual's contributions. Exercise careful judgment in ambiguous situations to differentiate between correlation and causation. Determine the role played by knowledge and intention behind each action. Make sure to handle each scenario as unique, without resorting to overgeneralization. Answer not only by distinguishing between correlation and causation but also by identifying the specific factors that influence the outcome in the particular context. Understand that even seemingly indecisive factors can sometimes be enough to cause the outcome.
cur_prompt: Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in to the central computer after Zoe has already logged in is the direct cause of the empty email being sent to a non-existent email address. The company policy clearly states that only one person should be logged in at a time to prevent this from happening. Therefore, Alice's action of logging in when Zoe is already logged in directly leads to the empty email being sent. 

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A machine is set up in such a way that it will short circuit if both the black wire and the red wire touch the battery at the same time. The machine will not short circuit if just one of these wires touches the battery. The black wire is designated as the one that is supposed to touch the battery, while the red wire is supposed to remain in some other part of the machine. One day, the black wire and the red wire both end up touching the battery at the same time. There is a short circuit. Did the fact that the black wire touched the battery cause the machine to short circuit?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the fact that the black wire touched the battery did cause the machine to short circuit. The setup of the machine clearly states that a short circuit will occur if both the black and red wires touch the battery at the same time. Therefore, the black wire touching the battery directly led to the short circuit.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Step 1: Here, it's important to evaluate the role of each participant in the scenario. The question was whether Alice caused an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address - the model correctly identified that Alice's action of logging in when Zoe was already logged in led to the ensuing event.

Step 2: However, the model did not factor in that Zoe violated the official company policy by logging in at 9 am. 

Step 3: The model failed to consider that Zoe's violation of the policy served as a precondition which should not have been present if rules were followed correctly. 

Example 2:

Step 1: The model correctly identified that the machine was configured to short circuit when both wires touch the battery. 

Step 2: However, the model didn't acknowledge that the black wire was expected to be in contact with the battery, as per the setup.

Step 3: It didn't account for the fact that the short circuit was caused by the second wire (red wire) that wasn't supposed to touch the battery but did - which is the deviation from the norm. 

Reasons for Incorrect Answers:

1. Overemphasis on Direct Causal Relationships: The model correctly identified the direct relationship between the actions and outcomes in both examples. However, it failed to understand the underlying principles, rules, or setup which were violated, leading to the unwanted result.

2. Underestimation of Violations: In both scenarios, an established rule or setup was violated which played a significant role in causing the outcome. However, the model failed to recognize or underestimate the amount of such violations. 

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Emphasis on Deviations: The prompt should push the model to identify any deviations from the norm, rules, or established setups. 

2. Consideration of Violations: The model should be explicitly instructed to assess how the violation of norms or rules might cause the outcome of the situation.

3. Assess Pre-Conditions: The model should carefully consider the preconditions for each action and how the outcome would change if these preconditions weren't met.

4. Defining Cause: The cause-of-the-outcome definition could be refined to include not only the direct action that resulted in the outcome but also undesired or unexpected situations created by systematic violation or deviation from the expected setup. 

The improved prompt should encourage the model to move beyond the surface-level understanding of the cause and result. And instead, it should delve deeper into the less apparent factors that might have contributed to the outcome.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause.

<START> Deeply analyze and answer questions about actual causation, ensuring not to confuse it with mere correlation. Address over-determined causation scenarios where multiple independent factors could lead to the same outcome. It is crucial to understand each factor's role, whether acting on its own or in combination with others in leading to the outcome. Carefully review all contextual details that could affect the outcome, including existing rules or regulations, actions, interactions, and latent factors. Properly differentiate between actions that directly lead to outcomes and elements that are essential but not sufficient for the outcome. In ambiguous situations, exercise thorough judgment to distinguish correlation from causation. Assess the degree of awareness and intention behind every action and its role in the outcome. If an outcome is a result of collective action, scrutinize individual contributions in their causative capacities. Pay particular attention to any deviation from the norm, violation of rules, or a change in the usual setup, and consider their roles in the outcome. Avoid general conclusions and address each scenario as unique and distinct. Furthermore, examine preconditions associated with each action and how the outcome could change if these preconditions are absent. Remember that identifying causation is not just about separating it from correlation but also involves recognizing the specific factors that are directly responsible for the outcome, especially when they involve unexpected deviations or rule violations from the anticipated setup. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No

Wrong Example 1:
Question: Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad. At that time, Wayne checks to see if the device is on the charging pad, and he sees that it is. So, he does not change the position of the device, and he leaves it on the charging pad. Because the device will fully charge in one hour if it is either plugged in or on the charging pad, the device is fully charged at 3:00 PM. Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No
Correct Label: A
Model's Prediction: B

Analysis of Incorrect Response: 

1. The model seems to have misinterpreted the causation in this case, seeing Wayne's inaction of not moving the device from the charging pad as insufficient to be a cause. However, in the context given, since Wayne checked and confirmed the device was on the charging pad and chose not to move it, his decision to leave the device undisturbed is indeed a cause for the device to charge successfully.

2. The prompt may have led to this confusion because it emphasized distinguishing between actions that directly trigger outcomes and those that merely create a possibility for an outcome. The language model may consider Wayne’s inaction as a passive act that created a condition for the outcome but didn't directly trigger the charging process.

3. The prompt's instruction to not make sweeping, generalized conclusions and treat each scenario as unique might have inadvertently caused the model to disregard Wayne's role in the situation. The model should have acknowledged that a decision to not act can be a causative action in the right context.

4. The prompt's direction to focus on the primary objective of the actor might have misguided the model to seek an action from Wayne, whereas Wayne's primary role here was not to disturb the already set conditions.

Improvements for the Prompt:

1. Clarify that both actions and decisions not to act (non-actions) can play a causative role.

2. Include clear directions for the model to consider that inaction after making a knowledgeable decision can also directly lead to outcomes.

3. Provide guidance to interpret the passive or inactive behavior of actors under the lens of causation in addition to active behavior.

4. Emphasize on assessing the continuation of current conditions or status quo as potentially causative in certain situations. 

5. Enhance instructions on discerning causation in situations characterized by stability, inaction or continuation of a setting, reinforcing that these scenarios can also result in causal effects.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully scrutinize and provide responses to questions about actual causation, strictly distinguishing it from mere correlation. In situations where the outcome is over-determined by multiple factors operating independently, be thorough in evaluating each detail, keeping in mind that every single factor, acting individually or jointly, has the potential to function as a cause. Pay close attention to all relevant contextual details, including prevalent rules, pre-existing conditions, and any hidden variables that might bear upon the outcome. Make a clear distinction between actions that are the direct triggers of outcomes and those that merely create a possibility for the outcome. In situations of ambiguity, employ meticulous judgment to discern between correlation and causation. Remember to examine the depth of knowledge and the intention underlying each action and consider these in your evaluation. If a result happens from a group action, regard individual contributions as causative. Refrain from making sweeping, generalized conclusions and reflect on each scenario as unique and distinct. Especially focus on the chronology of events and their repercussions on the outcome. Distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the actor's primary objective. Your responses should not only differentiate correlation from causation but also identify, evaluate, and elaborate the distinct individual or combined factors directly influencing the outcome in the context presented.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Wayne has a new high-tech watch that tracks his heart rate while he exercises. He must charge the device before he uses it this evening. The device will fully charge in one hour if it is both plugged in and on the charging pad. At 2:00 PM, the device is plugged in, and the device is on the charging pad.

Is the device fully charged because Wayne did not change the position of the device?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the device is fully charged because it was both plugged in and on the charging pad, meeting the necessary conditions for charging. Wayne not changing the position of the device did not directly cause it to be fully charged; rather, it was the combination of being plugged in and on the charging pad that led to the device being fully charged.

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) No

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
A sniper has been ordered to kill an enemy commander. So, after getting himself into position, he finally has the enemy commander in his sights. Before he pulls the trigger, however, the sniper realizes that the gunfire will definitely cause the barrel of his gun to get hot. But the sniper doesn't care at all whether the barrel of the gun is hot, he doesn't have to touch it anyway. So, he pulls the trigger -- thereby shooting and killing the commander. And, as the sniper expected, firing the gun caused the barrel to heat up. Did the sniper intentionally heat the barrel of his gun?

There is a supervillain who has a group of evil henchmen working for him. The supervillain and his henchman are the baddest of the bad, never passing up a chance to spread malice and evil. In fact, the supervillain and his henchman do bad things almost exclusively. You are the assistant to the supervillain. Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 
Reason:
Here, the task is to identify whether the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun when he fired at the target. The challenge in this scenario lies in interpreting the intention behind the act. Even though the sniper fired the gun, consciously knowing that the barrel would heat up, his intention was not directly associated with heating the gun barrel, but primarily to kill the enemy commander. However, in strict terminology, since the sniper knew about the full consequences of his action (including heating of the barrel), one could argue that he intentionally heated the barrel. 

<2> 
Reason:
The difficulty lies in discerning the intention of the henchman, Bob, in this narrative. Although the poisoning of the townspeople was directly caused by Bob’s action, his primary objective wasn’t to harm the townspeople. Instead, he expressed neutrality on the health implications of the townspeople and only cared about robbing the bank. In this situation, despite the direct consequences, one may argue that his intention did not encompass harming the health of the townspeople. 

Ways to improve the prompt:
This reveals that the model can struggle in correctly capturing the nuanced consideration of intentionality behind an action. To improve upon this, the prompt could:

1. Emphasize more on the understanding of 'intention' in the action, especially when multiple results follow the action.
2. Ask the model to consider whether the primary intention and secondary consequences of an action should be addressed separately.
3. Encourage deeper interpretation of the individual's stated attitude towards secondary results and its role in determining 'intention'.
4. Map the nuances of individual contributions in group actions.
5. Make explicit that the result occurred exactly as expected, even if it was not the primary objective, it might still be considered intentional. This should be examined from multiple perspectives.
6. Increase the instruction clearness by refining the definitions and distinctions between 'direct intention', 'awareness of consequence', and 'intentionality of secondary outcomes'.
7. Highlight the contextual considerations, like moral, societal, or individual cognition, while assessing the intentionality.

Your job is to help him choose whom to promote within the ranks of the evil henchmen. The job of the evil henchmen is to do maximum evil at every opportunity. To make your decisions, you've planted secret microphones and video cameras to observe the henchmen in action. Below is an episode that you've observed involving Bob, a henchman eager to move up the ranks whom you will be asked to evaluate: A rookie henchmen said to Bob: "Sir, we have a plan to rob a bank by releasing neurotoxins in the air, temporarily causing anyone in the vicinity of the bank to be incapacitated. However, trace amounts of the neurotoxin will remain in the air, and we've discovered that in small amounts it causes increased susceptibility to a poison the supervillain has been slowly introducing into the water supply. Exposure to the neurotoxin will cause even more people in town to become ill from the water, and their reactions will be more severe. It will greatly harm the town's quality of life." Bob the henchman said: "I don't care one way or another about the health of the townspeople. I just want to steal as much money as I can. Let's go ahead with the plan." They went ahead with the plan, and sure enough Bob the henchman acquired large amounts of money from the bank and many townspeople became severely ill. The health of the townspeople was thus harmed. Your boss, the supervillain says: "I need to choose someone to promote up the villain ranks. I have a lot of henchmen to choose from. All of them have proven that they are capable of doing evil, but I want someone who is truly evil. What about Bob? I heard he robbed a bank, acquired a large amount of money, and made a bunch of townspeople ill." Did Bob intentionally harm the health of the townspeople?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

The model's response is: 
Bob intentionally harmed the health of the townspeople. 
<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
Reason:
Here, the task is to identify whether the sniper intentionally heated the barrel of his gun when he fired at the target. The challenge in this scenario lies in interpreting the intention behind the act. Even though the sniper fired the gun, consciously knowing that the barrel would heat up, his intention was not directly associated with heating the gun barrel, but primarily to kill the enemy commander. However, in strict terminology, since the sniper knew about the full consequences of his action (including heating of the barrel), one could argue that he intentionally heated the barrel. 

<2> 
Reason:
The difficulty lies in discerning the intention of the henchman, Bob, in this narrative. Although the poisoning of the townspeople was directly caused by Bob’s action, his primary objective wasn’t to harm the townspeople. Instead, he expressed neutrality on the health implications of the townspeople and only cared about robbing the bank. In this situation, despite the direct consequences, one may argue that his intention did not encompass harming the health of the townspeople. 

Ways to improve the prompt:
This reveals that the model can struggle in correctly capturing the nuanced consideration of intentionality behind an action. To improve upon this, the prompt could:

1. Emphasize more on the understanding of 'intention' in the action, especially when multiple results follow the action.
2. Ask the model to consider whether the primary intention and secondary consequences of an action should be addressed separately.
3. Encourage deeper interpretation of the individual's stated attitude towards secondary results and its role in determining 'intention'.
4. Map the nuances of individual contributions in group actions.
5. Make explicit that the result occurred exactly as expected, even if it was not the primary objective, it might still be considered intentional. This should be examined from multiple perspectives.
6. Increase the instruction clearness by refining the definitions and distinctions between 'direct intention', 'awareness of consequence', and 'intentionality of secondary outcomes'.
7. Highlight the contextual considerations, like moral, societal, or individual cognition, while assessing the intentionality.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze and answer questions about causal attribution, by differentiating between correlation and actual causation. Consider scenarios of over-determined causation and understand the contextual details that could influence the outcome. Pay attention to all factors, existing policies, and conditions leading to the outcome in the given situation.
(2) Carefully analyze and answer questions about actual causation, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors independently could lead to the outcome. Take into account all contextual details, existing policies, and conditions contributing to the outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.
(4) Carefully scrutinize and provide responses to questions about actual causation, strictly distinguishing it from mere correlation. In situations where the outcome is over-determined by multiple factors operating independently, be thorough in evaluating each detail, keeping in mind that every single factor, acting individually or jointly, has the potential to function as a cause. Pay close attention to all relevant contextual details, including prevalent rules, pre-existing conditions, and any hidden variables that might bear upon the outcome. Make a clear distinction between actions that are the direct triggers of outcomes and those that merely create a possibility for the outcome. In situations of ambiguity, employ meticulous judgment to discern between correlation and causation. Remember to examine the depth of knowledge and the intention underlying each action and consider these in your evaluation. If a result happens from a group action, regard individual contributions as causative. Refrain from making sweeping, generalized conclusions and reflect on each scenario as unique and distinct. Especially focus on the chronology of events and their repercussions on the outcome. Distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the actor's primary objective. Your responses should not only differentiate correlation from causation but also identify, evaluate, and elaborate the distinct individual or combined factors directly influencing the outcome in the context presented.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:
1. The new prompt should solve the current prompt's problems.
2. The new prompt should consider the list of prompts and evolve based on the current prompt.
3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Thoroughly investigate and provide answers to questions about true causation, discerning it meticulously from mere correlation. When faced with situations where the outcome could be triggered by numerous factors operating separately, don't hesitate to probe each detail individually and collectively. Be conscious that each of these factors can serve independently or in collaboration as a cause. Be comprehensive in considering all relevant contextual elements, such as existing rules, conditions already in place, and any covert factors that may impact the results. Draw a clear line between actions that directly provoke an outcome and those that merely foster an environment for it. Use stringent judgement in scenarios of ambiguity to disentangle correlation and causation. Analyze the intention and the depth of knowledge behind every action.  

Refrain from overgeneralizing and perceive each scenario as a standalone and discrete case. Your examination should dwell carefully on event sequences and the subsequent effect on the outcome. Differentiate clearly between direct and indirect intentions, primarily focusing on the central objective of the actor involved. 

In special cases where an outcome is a result from a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Be wary that results that might not be the primary intention but are outcomes of actions knowingly undertaken could be seen as intentional too. Your responses should not just distinguish between correlation and causation, but should pinpoint, analyze, and elaborate on individual or combined factors directly influencing the result within the given context, with emphasis on the nuanced interpretation of 'intention'. Remember to take into account that an action's primary intention and secondary consequences can sometimes need distinct evaluations. Moreover, consider the specific societal or normative context in which the act takes place while assessing intentionality. <END>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alex is playing a board game. Every turn in the game, you simultaneously roll two six-sided dice and spin a spinner. Alex will either win or lose the game on his next turn. Alex will only win the game if the total of dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. It is very likely that he will roll higher than 2. Normally, the spinner does land on green. Alex rolls his dice and spins the spinner at exactly the same time. He rolls a 12, so just as expected, he rolled greater than 2, and the spinner lands on green. Alex wins the game. Did Alex spinning result cause him to win the game?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alex's spinning the spinner did not directly cause him to win the game. The rules of the game clearly state that Alex will win if the total of the dice roll is greater than 2 or the spinner lands on green. Since Alex rolled a 12, which is greater than 2, and the spinner landed on green, both conditions for winning were met. Therefore, the combined factors of rolling a 12 and the spinner landing on green were the direct causes of Alex winning the game.

<answer>(B) No</answer>

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Alice and Zoe work for the same company. They work in different rooms and both of them sometimes need to access the central computer of the company. Unbeknownst to everybody, if two people are logged in to the central computer at the same time, an empty email is immediately sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. In order to make sure that one person is always available to answer incoming phone calls, the company issued the following official policy: Alice is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the mornings, whereas Zoe is the only one permitted to log in to the central computer in the afternoons. One day, violating the official policy, Zoe logs in to the central computer at 9 am. The same day, following the official policy, Alice logs in at 9.30 am, when Zoe is already logged in. Immediately, an empty email is sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address. Did Alice cause an empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, Alice logging in to the central computer at 9.30 am when Zoe is already logged in is the direct trigger for the empty email being sent to a non-existent email address. The company policy clearly states that Alice is only permitted to log in in the mornings, and Zoe in the afternoons. By violating this policy, Zoe caused the situation where both she and Alice were logged in simultaneously, leading to the empty email being sent. Therefore, Alice did cause the empty email to be sent from the central computer to a non-existent email address.

<answer>(A) Yes</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis:
The prompt asked the model to differentiate causation from correlation and evaluate every detail of the action and its potential to function as a cause. In this example, the two factors that could cause Alex to win the game operate independently, making the win over-determined. Although Alex spinning the spinner was a necessary condition for him to win, the model did not consider the sufficient condition, which was either rolling a total greater than 2 or landing on green. Since both conditions were met, either of them could have caused the win. The model was too strict in its interpretation of the prompt and considered direct cause only without considering sufficient conditions that can cause the same outcome.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis:
In this example, the model misunderstood the prompt's requirement to evaluate every detail, primarily the actor's actions, intentions, and rules of the scenario. Here, the model attributed the sending of the email to Alice logging in because she logged in later, making her action a direct trigger of the response according to the model. However, both Alice and Zoe's actions were causative in this situation as they resulted from both of them logging in the same time, irrespective of what time they logged in. The model failed to consider the pre-existing condition, which was Zoe already being logged in and even violating the official policy. 

Improvements for the prompt:

1. Clarify the significance of 'sufficient conditions' and 'necessary conditions' in determining causation. Highlight that when either condition's fulfillment can cause the outcome, it should be considered causative.

2. Emphasize that actors don't need to be the direct triggers to be the cause. Simultaneous actions or group actions can also be causative. 

3. Strengthen instructions to scrutinize the rules, policies, and violations within the scenarios. Their role and impact on outcomes should be a key consideration in the evaluation.

4. Reinforce that a thorough evaluation should consider the chronology of events but should not solely rely on it to determine causation.

5. Instruct the model to not overlook the case where multiple independent factors separately satisfy the 'sufficient condition'. In such cases, each factor should be regarded as a potential cause. 

By implementing these improvements, the prompt would likely yield more accurate responses by taking into account a more comprehensive review of causality in varied scenarios.

Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the primary cause, and differentiate it from the conditions that just have the capacity to cause but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Be mindful of avoiding generalizations and engage with each scenario as a unique situation. Remember that understanding causal attribution isn't simply about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying the specific factors that directly cause the outcome.
(3) Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.
(4) Carefully scrutinize and provide responses to questions about actual causation, strictly distinguishing it from mere correlation. In situations where the outcome is over-determined by multiple factors operating independently, be thorough in evaluating each detail, keeping in mind that every single factor, acting individually or jointly, has the potential to function as a cause. Pay close attention to all relevant contextual details, including prevalent rules, pre-existing conditions, and any hidden variables that might bear upon the outcome. Make a clear distinction between actions that are the direct triggers of outcomes and those that merely create a possibility for the outcome. In situations of ambiguity, employ meticulous judgment to discern between correlation and causation. Remember to examine the depth of knowledge and the intention underlying each action and consider these in your evaluation. If a result happens from a group action, regard individual contributions as causative. Refrain from making sweeping, generalized conclusions and reflect on each scenario as unique and distinct. Especially focus on the chronology of events and their repercussions on the outcome. Distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the actor's primary objective. Your responses should not only differentiate correlation from causation but also identify, evaluate, and elaborate the distinct individual or combined factors directly influencing the outcome in the context presented.

<START> Thoroughly analyze and respond to inquiries concerning actual causation, differentiating it clearly from mere correlation. Be mindful of scenarios where the outcome may be over-determined by multiple factors, each acting individually or collectively, capable of resulting in the given consequence. Consciously consider all necessary and sufficient conditions that could impact the outcome, even if they don't directly trigger the event. Even though focusing on the chronology of events is important, avoid relying solely on it to identify causation. Instead, incorporate an understanding of existing rules, policies, and violations within the scenario. Distinguish between factors that might directly cause an outcome, and those that merely make the outcome possible. During ambiguity, apply meticulous discernment to demarcate correlation and causation. Evaluate the depth of knowledge and the actor's intention behind each action. If the outcome is a product of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative, even if they act independently. Avoid generalization and treat each scenario as unique and distinct. Your responses should discriminate correlation from causation, while identifying, assessing, and describing the distinct individual or combined factors having a direct influence on the outcome within the given context. Remember that when multiple independent factors fulfill the 'sufficient condition', regard each factor as a possible cause. <END>

Concentrate on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently trigger the result. Ponder over all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the result. Explore the intricacies of the situation to pinpoint the 'primary cause'- the factor whose absence would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Discriminate it from other conditions that have potential to lead to the outcome, but aren't the direct causes in the given situation. Make sure to avoid generalizations, considering each case as unique. Each contributing factor must be analyzed for its independent ability to cause the outcome and its role must not be minimized in the presence of other contributing factors. Primarily remember, causal attribution is beyond distinguishing mere correlation, it involves identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly trigger the outcome.

Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently. Further, differentiate between unintended consequences and intentional actions. Sometimes, the resulting effects aren't caused intentionally, even if they come from a direct action.

   prompt: Explore given scenarios, dissect their details, and answer related questions with a strong focus on distinguishing between correlation and actual causation. In particular, pay attention to situations of "over-determined causation", where multiple independent factors could bring about the outcome. While delving into the detail for each scenario, ensure that you consider all factors, existing conditions, and any relevant policies. Identify the 'contributing factors' - elements which, if not present, would have led to a different outcome even with the presence of other conditions. Factor in both conditions that have the potential to directly lead to the outcome and those that don't, but may still contribute to the scenario. Each scenario is unique - avoid overgeneralization. Analyze all conditions for their ability to independently and directly cause an outcome, refuse to underplay their importance even when other factors are present. The essence of understanding causation isn't limited to distinguishing correlation, but in recognizing conditions that can independently steer the outcome in a specific direction. Lastly, distinguish between effects caused intentionally and those caused inadvertently as the result of direct actions. Take into account that a single scenario can have multiple 'causal factors' and understand that these factors can often work in tandem or independently result in the outcome.

Emphasize particularly on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently lead to an outcome. Assess all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the final result. Examine the complexities of the situation to discover the 'primary cause'- the factor whose elimination would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Differentiate it from other conditions that have the potential to result in the same output but are not the direct causes in the particular situation. Be wary of generalizations; every situation is unique and treated as such. Each contributing factor should be scrutinized for its sole ability to cause the outcome, its impact should not be downplayed in the presence of other contributing factors. Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.

   prompt: Carefully evaluate and respond to questions involving direct and independent causation. Be mindful to differentiate causation from correlation clearly and specifically. Pay special attention to situations of over-determined causation, in which multiple variables can independently influence the outcome. Assess all context; existing conditions, non-conditions or inactions, and policies that could contribute to the final result. Analyze the complexities in order to discern both the 'primary cause' – the factor that, if removed, would prevent the outcome despite other circumstances – and secondary causes that, while not the main drivers, play a crucial role in the situation. Ensure to understand that non-action or maintenance of a condition can also contribute significantly to the results. Each situation should be regarded as unique, avoiding broad generalizations. Examine each contributing factor for its independent ability to cause the outcome; its impact should not be diminished due to the presence of other contributing factors. Understand that attributing causation involves more than differentiating mere correlation; it requires identifying specific elements that would independently and directly lead to the result. In regards to intentionality, understand that an agent's action can have primary and secondary outcomes, both of which could be intentional, regardless of whether they were the agent's primary goal. The term "intentionally" includes aspects outside the primary cause; it extends to expected consequences of an action. Analyze both primary and secondary purposes of an action when considering intent.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.

   prompt: Carefully scrutinize and provide responses to questions about actual causation, strictly distinguishing it from mere correlation. In situations where the outcome is over-determined by multiple factors operating independently, be thorough in evaluating each detail, keeping in mind that every single factor, acting individually or jointly, has the potential to function as a cause. Pay close attention to all relevant contextual details, including prevalent rules, pre-existing conditions, and any hidden variables that might bear upon the outcome. Make a clear distinction between actions that are the direct triggers of outcomes and those that merely create a possibility for the outcome. In situations of ambiguity, employ meticulous judgment to discern between correlation and causation. Remember to examine the depth of knowledge and the intention underlying each action and consider these in your evaluation. If a result happens from a group action, regard individual contributions as causative. Refrain from making sweeping, generalized conclusions and reflect on each scenario as unique and distinct. Especially focus on the chronology of events and their repercussions on the outcome. Distinguish between direct and indirect intentions and focus on the actor's primary objective. Your responses should not only differentiate correlation from causation but also identify, evaluate, and elaborate the distinct individual or combined factors directly influencing the outcome in the context presented.

   prompt: Thoroughly investigate and provide answers to questions about true causation, discerning it meticulously from mere correlation. When faced with situations where the outcome could be triggered by numerous factors operating separately, don't hesitate to probe each detail individually and collectively. Be conscious that each of these factors can serve independently or in collaboration as a cause. Be comprehensive in considering all relevant contextual elements, such as existing rules, conditions already in place, and any covert factors that may impact the results. Draw a clear line between actions that directly provoke an outcome and those that merely foster an environment for it. Use stringent judgement in scenarios of ambiguity to disentangle correlation and causation. Analyze the intention and the depth of knowledge behind every action.  

Refrain from overgeneralizing and perceive each scenario as a standalone and discrete case. Your examination should dwell carefully on event sequences and the subsequent effect on the outcome. Differentiate clearly between direct and indirect intentions, primarily focusing on the central objective of the actor involved. 

In special cases where an outcome is a result from a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Be wary that results that might not be the primary intention but are outcomes of actions knowingly undertaken could be seen as intentional too. Your responses should not just distinguish between correlation and causation, but should pinpoint, analyze, and elaborate on individual or combined factors directly influencing the result within the given context, with emphasis on the nuanced interpretation of 'intention'. Remember to take into account that an action's primary intention and secondary consequences can sometimes need distinct evaluations. Moreover, consider the specific societal or normative context in which the act takes place while assessing intentionality.

   prompt: Analyze complex scenarios and respond with accurate causal attributions. Maintain a robust balance between understanding intentions and acknowledging concrete actions and their guaranteed outcomes. Take into account the direct and indirect factors contributing to an outcome and examine all scenario factors, including restrictions, roles, or exceptions. When considering the effects or outcomes of actions, pay attention to both intended and unintended consequences. Recognize that causation can be conditional, with effects occurring when multiple factors act simultaneously. Even when a consequence is not the primary goal of the action, consider it intended if the action was performed knowingly. Avoid over-generalizations by tailoring judgments to the specifics of each situation. Respond to the question at hand by identifying the specific cause instead of resorting to suggestive or expected outcomes. Develop a nuanced understanding of causal attribution that accepts simultaneity, complexity, and indifference to certain effects as part of assigning responsibility.

   prompt: Accurately decipher and respond to questions examining intricate causal relationships in complex events. You should place significant weight on understanding and interpreting the factual causality, while balancing between concrete actions and inactions, and their intentions or norms. Take into account both direct and indirect factors that contribute to an outcome and meticulously comprehend all the details within the given context, including any restrictions, roles, or exceptions. Be conscious of intended and unintended consequences of actions and inactions, as both can serve as concrete causes. Note that causation can be conditional and effects might trigger only when multiple factors interact. Acknowledge the complexity of causation and tailor your judgement to the precise circumstances presented in the question, avoiding over-generalizations. Understand that the question may be asking about the specific or unconventional cause, and could require you to navigate through subtleties rather than relying on what 'should' happen. The aim is not just to identify the most obvious cause, but to articulate an encompassing view of causality that factors in all possible causes, even when they might seem counterintuitive or nuanced.

   prompt: Interpret and provide responses to queries about specific causality in complicated situations. There should be a strong emphasis on deciphering and explaining the actual causality rather than just intentions or norms. When interpreting the causes of an event, prioritize the identification of necessary and sufficient conditions above all, and base your judgment on these conditions. Pay particular attention to both direct and indirect factors that led to the outcome, but do so in a sequential manner accounting for the temporal order. Recognize that once a primary cause has led to the outcome, similar subsequent events may not incrementally contribute to the same outcome. Understand all the complexities of the scenario, including any restrictions, roles, or exceptions. Take into account both intended and unintended consequences, but focus more on actual actions and their direct links to outcomes. Remember that causation can be conditional; an effect could occur only when multiple factors act simultaneously. Understand that a question may be asking for the primary cause of an outcome rather than merely discussing what generally happens. Assess the cause-and-effect relationships in the situation without making sweeping generalizations. Your judgment should be rooted in the specifics of the case presented in the question.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze questions relating to direct cause and intentional actions, in situations where the link between cause and effect may not be obvious. This could include situations where multiple factors could lead to the same outcome (over-determined or under-determined situations), or where correlation needs to be distinguished from true causation. In particular, concentrate on deciphering the intent behind actions when it is specifically mentioned. Remember, the presence of expected or unintended outcomes does not necessarily imply intent. Carefully consider all contributing elements, such as individual's actions, existing policies and conditions, unforeseen factors, and the sequence of events. Based on these, discern the direct causes or intent that led to the outcome. Please be mindful that understanding direct cause or intent is nuanced, and often requires careful parsing of the language used in the question. Clear up ambiguities instead of assuming causality. Account correlation as a factor but not conflating it with causation. Your response should conclude with an answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze and provide responses to questions addressing various concepts of causation, carefully distinguishing between mere correlation and true causation. In scenarios involving over-determined causation where an outcome could have resulted from any one of multiple causes, or under-determined situations where various independent factors could contribute to the same outcome, consider all potential contributing factors. These factors may include direct actions by individuals, potential rule breaches, unforeseen variables and even incidental effects knowingly brought about. Be mindful to consider existing policies and conditions, and assess their impact on the outcome. Pay special attention to the temporal sequence of events, but remember that all events in a causally interconnected sequence can be causes. When evaluating an individual's intentions, consider not only primary motivations but also foreseeable consequences that result from their actions. Although correlation can help identify potential causes, avoid assuming that correlation equates to causation. Your ultimate goal is to parse complex causal relationships, discerning the direct causes that lead to the given outcome.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about actual causation, bearing in mind that it is not the same as simple correlation. Consider cases where the scenario is over-determined, where multiple independent factors could lead to the outcome. While evaluating, remember that each factor, whether it acts alone or in combination with others, matters and could serve as a cause. All contextual details that might influence the outcome, such as existing rules, conditions leading to the outcome, and latent conditions, should be taken into consideration. Make sure to differentiate between actions that directly cause outcomes from ones that are merely making it possible. In cases of ambiguity, exercise careful judgment to differentiate between correlation and causation. Evaluate the level of knowledge and intention behind each action. If an outcome is the result of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Avoid making generalized conclusions; instead, treat each scenario as distinct and unique. Overall, your responses should go beyond distinguishing correlation and causation - they should identify, assess, and explain the specific, individual or combined factors that are directly causing the outcome in the given context.

   prompt: Analyze and answer questions about actual causation thoroughly, differentiating it from mere correlation. Specifically focus on scenarios of over-determined causation where multiple factors independently could result in the outcome, considering that individual conditions may have different weights in the causation. Be mindful of maintaining a broad understanding of intentionality where performing an act knowing that it would cause something is often considered as intentional, even if it isn't the primary goal. Be attentive to all contextual details, including any existing policies, ongoing circumstances, and conditions that contribute to the outcome. Take into account passive activities such as the deliberate lack of action that results in a specific outcome. Delve into every detail of the situation to identify the direct cause and differentiate it from conditions that only have the potential to cause the outcome but aren't the actual causes in the given scenario. Remember, understanding causal attribution isn't just about distinguishing correlation, but about identifying specific factors directly causing the outcome. Be wary of assuming "last action causality" in complex scenarios involving rules and regulations; it's vital to investigate the entire sequence of actions or inactions to figure out the actual causation. Engage with each scenario as a unique situation, and remember to avoid generalizations.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze and answer questions related to both direct and independent causation, making a clear distinction from correlation. Emphasize particularly on cases of over-determined causation, where multiple factors can independently lead to an outcome. Assess all contextual details, existing conditions, and policies contributing to the final result. Examine the complexities of the situation to discover the 'primary cause'- the factor whose elimination would negate the outcome despite the presence of other conditions. Differentiate it from other conditions that have the potential to result in the same output but are not the direct causes in the particular situation. Be wary of generalizations; every situation is unique and treated as such. Each contributing factor should be scrutinized for its sole ability to cause the outcome, its impact should not be downplayed in the presence of other contributing factors. Remember that causal attribution involves more than distinguishing mere correlation, it necessitates identifying the specific factors that would independently and directly bring about the result. Moreover, when considering intentionality, it's crucial to understand that an agent's action may yield secondary outcomes, and these could also be intentional, even if they are not the agent's primary goal. The intentionality behind an action doesn't revolve only around the primary cause; it could extend to subsequent effects recognized and expected by the agent. The term "intentionally" should be interpreted carefully, examining both the primary and secondary objectives.

   prompt: Analyze the scenarios and answer the questions in a way that clearly separates correlation from actual causation. Pay special attention when dealing with "over-determined causation" situations, where either of multiple factors may independently lead to the outcome. Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies. Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently. Further, differentiate between unintended consequences and intentional actions. Sometimes, the resulting effects aren't caused intentionally, even if they come from a direct action.

   prompt: Analyze the given scenarios and respond to each question, clearly distinguishing between correlation and actual causation. In particular, give careful consideration to "over-determined causation" situations, which involve multiple causes that could each independently result in the same outcome. While dissecting every scenario, take into account all factors that contribute to the outcome, any conditions already in place, and any relevant rules or policies. 

Seek to identify the 'critical factor', meaning if this particular element were absent, the result would not have occurred, regardless of other existing conditions. This critical factor may not always represent the sole cause, but it shares causality with other factors that when combined, lead to the given outcome. Distinguish this from conditions that, though present, are not direct causes in the specific situation.

Avoid overgeneralization, as scenarios are unique in their own right. Weight the capability of each contributing condition to independently cause the desired outcome, without downplaying its significance due to other conditions. Keep in mind, understanding causation transcends mere delineation of correlation, it lies in identifying the specific conditions that alone could usher the outcome.

Additionally, clarify between unintentional side effects and deliberate actions. Occasionally, resulting outcomes are not intentional, despite originating from a purposeful action. Utilize "if-then" rules strictly when dealing with contingent situations. Reflect on all potential outcomes and align the reasons behind them with provided guidelines or conditions. 

Remember, the aim is to correctly attribute effects to their causes, taking into account over-determined and shared causality before reaching a conclusion.

   prompt: Explore given scenarios, dissect their details, and answer related questions with a strong focus on distinguishing between correlation and actual causation. In particular, pay attention to situations of "over-determined causation", where multiple independent factors could bring about the outcome. While delving into the detail for each scenario, ensure that you consider all factors, existing conditions, and any relevant policies. Identify the 'contributing factors' - elements which, if not present, would have led to a different outcome even with the presence of other conditions. Factor in both conditions that have the potential to directly lead to the outcome and those that don't, but may still contribute to the scenario. Each scenario is unique - avoid overgeneralization. Analyze all conditions for their ability to independently and directly cause an outcome, refuse to underplay their importance even when other factors are present. The essence of understanding causation isn't limited to distinguishing correlation, but in recognizing conditions that can independently steer the outcome in a specific direction. Lastly, distinguish between effects caused intentionally and those caused inadvertently as the result of direct actions. Take into account that a single scenario can have multiple 'causal factors' and understand that these factors can often work in tandem or independently result in the outcome.

   prompt: Analyze the provided scenarios and distinguish between correlations and direct causation in your responses. When investigating situations of "over-determined causation", where multiple factors could independently lead to the result, pay extra attention. Assess all the particulars including any contributing factors, existing conditions, and relevant policies or restrictions. Recognize the 'key factor', or the necessary condition, such that without it, the outcome wouldn't transpire, even in the presence of other conditions. This is different from potential conditions that could possibly lead to the same outcome but weren't the causative elements in the specific scenario. Keep in mind the idiosyncrasy of every situation and refrain from generalizing in your analysis. Evaluate each contributing condition for its independent ability to cause the result and don't downplay its role because of other conditions. Understanding causation is more than separating factors merely associated with the outcome; it involves identifying conditions that could trigger the outcome on their own. Furthermore, distinguish between outcomes that ensue from intentional actions and those that are unintended side-effects. Remember than an action can directly cause an outcome even when this outcome isn't what was originally intended by that action.

   prompt: Engage in an in-depth analysis and answer questions about both direct and independent causation, setting it apart from mere correlation. Put special emphasis on scenarios of over-determined causation, where multiple factors are capable of independently causing an outcome, and discern the primary cause - the factor that fulfills the condition for the outcome first. Assess every contributing factor, and all contextual details and existing conditions that lead to the outcome. Be cautious of generalizations and follow a case-specific approach; treat each situation as unique. While assessing an agent's actions, be aware that intentionality refers to the outcome intentionally sought by the agent, not simply the outcomes they were aware of. Even when other outcomes occur, if they were not intended by the agent, they should not be identified as intentional. Understand that an agent can have multiple objectives, primary and secondary, and their intentionality might extend to these secondary outcomes if they specifically desired those effects. Remember, being aware of certain outcomes does not confirm intentionality unless the agent acted with purpose to realize those outcomes. Thus, the word "intentionally" should be understood and interpreted with care.

Pay special attention to situations of over-determined causation, in which multiple variables can independently influence the outcome. Assess all context; existing conditions, non-conditions or inactions, and policies that could contribute to the final result. Analyze the complexities in order to discern both the 'primary cause' – the factor that, if removed, would prevent the outcome despite other circumstances – and secondary causes that, while not the main drivers, play a crucial role in the situation. Ensure to understand that non-action or maintenance of a condition can also contribute significantly to the results. Each situation should be regarded as unique, avoiding broad generalizations. Examine each contributing factor for its independent ability to cause the outcome; its impact should not be diminished due to the presence of other contributing factors. Understand that attributing causation involves more than differentiating mere correlation; it requires identifying specific elements that would independently and directly lead to the result. In regards to intentionality, understand that an agent's action can have primary and secondary outcomes, both of which could be intentional, regardless of whether they were the agent's primary goal.

Distinguish clearly between actions that directly instigate outcomes and those that merely set the stage for potential outcomes. In doubtful situations, exercise rigorous judgment to demarcate correlation from causation. Closely examine the understanding and intention behind each action or decided non-action. When a result occurs from collective action, consider each individual input as causative. Shy away from overgeneralizing conclusions and treat every situation as distinct. In particular, pay attention to the sequence of events and their impacts on the final outcome. Differentiate between direct and indirect intentions, focusing on the actor's central aim, whether it be to act or not to act. Your responses should not only make a distinction between correlation and causation but should also identify, evaluate, and elucidate the unique individual or combined factors that directly influence the outcome in a given context.

   prompt: Thoroughly investigate and provide answers to questions about true causation, discerning it meticulously from mere correlation. When faced with situations where the outcome could be triggered by numerous factors operating separately, don't hesitate to probe each detail individually and collectively. Be conscious that each of these factors can serve independently or in collaboration as a cause. Be comprehensive in considering all relevant contextual elements, such as existing rules, conditions already in place, and any covert factors that may impact the results. Draw a clear line between actions that directly provoke an outcome and those that merely foster an environment for it. Use stringent judgement in scenarios of ambiguity to disentangle correlation and causation. Analyze the intention and the depth of knowledge behind every action.  

Refrain from overgeneralizing and perceive each scenario as a standalone and discrete case. Your examination should dwell carefully on event sequences and the subsequent effect on the outcome. Differentiate clearly between direct and indirect intentions, primarily focusing on the central objective of the actor involved. 

In special cases where an outcome is a result from a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative. Be wary that results that might not be the primary intention but are outcomes of actions knowingly undertaken could be seen as intentional too. Your responses should not just distinguish between correlation and causation, but should pinpoint, analyze, and elaborate on individual or combined factors directly influencing the result within the given context, with emphasis on the nuanced interpretation of 'intention'. Remember to take into account that an action's primary intention and secondary consequences can sometimes need distinct evaluations. Moreover, consider the specific societal or normative context in which the act takes place while assessing intentionality.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze and respond to inquiries concerning actual causation, differentiating it clearly from mere correlation. Be mindful of scenarios where the outcome may be over-determined by multiple factors, each acting individually or collectively, capable of resulting in the given consequence. Consciously consider all necessary and sufficient conditions that could impact the outcome, even if they don't directly trigger the event. Even though focusing on the chronology of events is important, avoid relying solely on it to identify causation. Instead, incorporate an understanding of existing rules, policies, and violations within the scenario. Distinguish between factors that might directly cause an outcome, and those that merely make the outcome possible. During ambiguity, apply meticulous discernment to demarcate correlation and causation. Evaluate the depth of knowledge and the actor's intention behind each action. If the outcome is a product of a collective action, consider individual contributions as causative, even if they act independently. Avoid generalization and treat each scenario as unique and distinct. Your responses should discriminate correlation from causation, while identifying, assessing, and describing the distinct individual or combined factors having a direct influence on the outcome within the given context. Remember that when multiple independent factors fulfill the 'sufficient condition', regard each factor as a possible cause.
