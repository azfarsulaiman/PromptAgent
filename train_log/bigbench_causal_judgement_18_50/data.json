Pay special attention when dealing with \"over-determined causation\" situations, where either of multiple factors may independently lead to the outcome. Explore the details of every given situation, taking into account all contributing factors, existing conditions, and any related policies. Identify the 'key factor'- the element that if removed, the given outcome wouldn't occur, even with the existence of other conditions. Separate this from potential conditions that aren't the direct causes in the specific situation. Remember that every scenario has its uniqueness, so avoid generalizing. Analyze each contributing condition for its own ability to cause the outcome and avoid reducing its importance in the presence of other conditions. Mainly, understanding causation isn't merely telling apart correlation, it's about recognizing the specific conditions that might trigger the outcome independently. Further, differentiate between unintended consequences and intentional actions. Sometimes, the resulting effects aren't caused intentionally, even if they come from a direct action.",
