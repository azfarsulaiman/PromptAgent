Your task is to determine if this connection is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay special attention to the nature of information in both premise and hypothesis: direct assertions or possible assumptions made by any character about another's belief. Hypotheses may contain elements from the premise but do not automatically prove entailment. Beware of shifts in context such as changes in the messenger, or degree of directness of the information in both premise and hypothesis, since these may alter the original meanings or assumptions. It's equally important to consider the dynamics of second-hand information and its impact. Unpack each premise and each hypothesis, scrutinizing every element, like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Gauge the nature of the relationships - direct or indirect - between these elements, and note that similar content can carry different implications depending on their transmission pathway. Remember to analyze if subjective beliefs or second-hand input are presented as unquestionable truths. A true entailment suggests an unambiguous, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, in which subjective beliefs do not intervene. In every step of your analysis, be meticulous, rationalize your choices carefully, and provide a comprehensive reasoning for your decisions. It is essential to be exact whether the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is straightforward or indirect.

Make sure to not leap to conclusions rather, spend enough time to contemplate and consider each aspect involved in the scenario meticulously. After this careful assessment, pick between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on your analysis. Give a clear rationale behind your choice, and ensure that your choice naturally derives from the premise and not from over-complicated deductions. Finally, place your choice between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring this encapsulation is the result of a balanced analysis that considers detailed scrutiny and overall comprehension of the outlined scenario.",

            "prompt": "For this exercise, you need to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Your task is to determine if this connection is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay special attention to the nature of information in both premise and hypothesis: direct assertions or possible assumptions made by any character about another's belief. Hypotheses may contain elements from the premise but do not automatically prove entailment. Beware of shifts in context such as changes in the messenger, or degree of directness of the information in both premise and hypothesis, since these may alter the original meanings or assumptions. It's equally important to consider the dynamics of second-hand information and its impact. Unpack each premise and each hypothesis, scrutinizing every element, like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Gauge the nature of the relationships - direct or indirect - between these elements, and note that similar content can carry different implications depending on their transmission pathway. Remember to analyze if subjective beliefs or second-hand input are presented as unquestionable truths. A true entailment suggests an unambiguous, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, in which subjective beliefs do not intervene. In every step of your analysis, be meticulous, rationalize your choices carefully, and provide a comprehensive reasoning for your decisions. It is essential to be exact whether the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is straightforward or indirect. Now, evaluate the ensuing premises and hypotheses and decide their linkage, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.",

            "prompt": "For this task, your role is to assess the relationship between the presented premise and the hypothesis. Your options to describe this relationship are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, the hypothesis might include some aspects of the premise, but this doesn't mean that the premise automatically entails the hypothesis. Beware of variations in context, as these can transform original meanings or assumptions - these variations could be changes in the source of the information, the level of the information, or the transition from direct to second-hand information. Be scrupulous in your judgment, considering the flow of information, possible shifts in meaning and the change in assumption levels. It's mandatory to analyze all components of the premise and the hypothesis, paying careful attention to subjects, actions, and objects involved, noting the directness or indirectness of their relationships. It's not only about what is said, but also who says it and the information's distance from the initial source. In the case of second-hand information or subjective beliefs, consider whether they are presented as actual facts. An entailment suggests a direct, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, not swayed by subjective beliefs. Always rationalise your choices and supply a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end, clarifying whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect. Now, analyze the following premises and hypotheses and ascertain their relationship, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.",
