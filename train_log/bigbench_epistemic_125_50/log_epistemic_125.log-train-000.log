I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about causal attribution

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about causal attribution
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James thinks that Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines. Hypothesis: Richard understands that three women sit at a table, taking notes from three identical magazines.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(A) entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example Reasoning:

The main issue with this prompt is that it does not clearly outline the task for the language model. The prompt asks the model to "answer questions about causal attribution" which focuses on cause and effect relationships. However, the subsequent example question asks the model to identify a relationship between two concepts ("entailment" or "non-entailment") which is a logical, not causal, type of connection. This might lead the model to predict answers inaccurately.

Moreover, the premise and hypothesis given in the example don't display a causal relationship, which could confuse the model due to the initial instruction of the prompt. The prompt does not articulate the need to disregard causal attribution when it is not present -- it needs to guide the model on handling such circumstances.

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:

1. Clarify task definition: Instead of asking the model to answer questions about causal attribution, the task could be defined in a more broad way to encompass various types of relationships. For example, "Analyze and determine various types of relationships and connections in given premises and hypotheses".

2. Introduce more relationship types: In this case, the task requires the model to decide if the relationship is "entailment" or "non-entailment". Hence, the prompt should instruct the model to recognize various types of relationships, not just causal ones.

3. Contingency Instructions: The prompt should instruct the model on what to do if the provided question does not involve causal attribution, e.g., "If the question does not involve causal attribution, focus on the given relationship types."

4. Repeat Key Instructions: Ensure that the model re-reads critical parts of the instruction for every question.

Revised Prompt:

"Analyze and determine various types of relationships and connections in given premises and hypotheses. Your task includes, but is not limited to, identifying causal relationships. If a question does not involve causal attribution, concentrate on the stated relationship types. Always consider the available options carefully and provide your answer in the format <answer>(A/B/C)</answer>. Remember to re-read the exact task requirements for each question to ensure accuracy."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:
The question is about identifying the relation between the premises and hypotheses. However, the given prompt, "Answer questions about causal attribution," does not provide explicit instructions to assess entailment or non-entailment. Causal attribution typically refers to the process of inferring causes for observed behavior, not necessarily entailment between statements. In this case, the premise states that "Richard assumes" something, while the hypothesis parallels this without the mention of Richard. The model incorrectly determines this as entailment, perhaps due to the similarity of the two statements, but neglects to consider the source of the assumptions (Richard vs Abigail). 

Example 2:
Here again, the model is tasked with assessing the relation between two statements. However, the prompt gears the model to look for causes and effects, not entailments. In this case, the model determines non-entailment when there is in fact entailment. The model might interpret dressing "only in a towel" and being "not wearing any clothes" as essentially different states, obscuring the underlying entailment.

Example 3:
Similar to example 1, the model incorrectly assesses the entailment. The model might be misled by the verbatim repetition and complexity of the sentences. Once again, the prompt's influence on the model to determine causes and effects potentially diverts focus from the actual task - identifying entailment.

To improve, we could consider the following:

1. Explicit Specification: Clearly state in the prompt that the model must identify entailment or non-entailment between premise and hypothesis.
2. Introduce a brief description of entailment/non-entailment: Making sure the model understands that it's supposed to assess whether the hypothesis logically follows from the premise.
3. Instruct the model to pay attention to the details: The model seems to struggle with complex premises/hypotheses. We could instruct it to pay special attention to the individual components (objects, subjects, actions) of each statement.
4. Avoid terms misleading for the task: Specifically, the prompt uses the term "causal attribution" which might steer the model to look for causes and effects instead of entailment. It might be better to replace it with a more relevant term.
5. Encourage the model to explicitly explain its reasoning: This might help to reveal the model's thought process and can serve as a double-check for its final decision.

Wrong Answer: The relation between the premise and hypothesis is entailment. <answer>(A)</answer>

Reason for Incorrectness: The error in the example seems to arise from a misunderstanding of the text and the terms of interest. In the case of entailment or non-entailment, the model should essentially be considering whether the premise directly implies or necessitates the hypothesis. Here, it seems the model has misunderstood the subjectivity of the statement. Joseph suspecting something doesn't automatically make it a fact. His suspicion about Isabella learning something doesn't entail that Isabella has indeed learned that thing. This is the reason the model's prediction is incorrect.

Improvements to the Prompt: 1) Direct the model to pay close attention to verbs and context that relate to subjectivity or certainty. 2) Clarify the definitions or parameters of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' to aid the model's understanding. Encourage the model to consider each piece of information independently and analytically. 3) Ask the model to cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. This could include specifying that a premise does not automatically affirm a hypothesis, especially when the premise is subjective or speculative. 4) To close the feedback loop, have the model explain its reasoning process for choosing the answer, this will help understand where the errors are in thinking.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James assumes that Taylor assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing. Hypothesis: James assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James assumes that Taylor assumes that a man in a black hat is standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing. The hypothesis simply states that James assumes that a man in a black hat is standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.

Since the hypothesis is a subset of the premise (it does not include the assumption made by Taylor), there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

gradient:
Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model is mistaken because it does not correctly interpret the implications of removing Taylor's assumption from the premise to create the hypothesis. The model assumes that, since the hypothesis is a subset of the premise, entailment should be the correct choice. However, this ignores the fact that Taylor's assumption in the premise indicates that the information about the man in the black hat is second-hand. This information is passed from the man in the black hat to Taylor and then to James. When considering the hypothesis, the information is stated to be directly from James, which changes the context and the validity of the information, resulting in a 'non-entailment' situation. 

Reasons for the wrong output:
1. Misunderstanding Indirect Information Flow: The AI model fails to understand the complexity of the assumptions made by multiple people. It sees the information in the hypothesis as a subset of the premise without recognizing the difference in the level of assumption between the two.

2. Incorrect Subset Theory Application: The model assumes that since the hypothesis exists within the premise, there has to be entailment. However, it does not consider the change in context when the level of assumption changes, leading to the wrong answer.

3. Context Misinterpretation: The model fails to observe the shift in context due to the removal of one assumption level (Taylor's assumption) when transitioning from the premise to the hypothesis.

Potential improvements for the prompt:
1. Add more specific instructions: Make instructions clearer that the task is not only to identify if the hypothesis is a subset of the premise but also whether the hypothesis maintains the same logical and contextual implications as the premise.

2. Emphasis on Context: The prompt should insist on careful consideration of contextual shifts and changes that may impact the original meaning or assumptions.

3. Detail Explanation Requirement: Extend the requirement for an explanation that justifies the entailment/non-entailment decision, focusing on understanding the information flow and any potential shift in meaning or assumptions. 

4. Further Explanation on Entailment & Non-Entailment: The prompt could provide brief explanations or examples of entailment and non-entailment to guide the model's understanding.

5. Handling Second-Hand Information: The prompt should give clear instructions to the AI to evaluate the propagation of second-hand information and its impact on the entailment/non-entailment judgment. 

By incorporating these elements, the prompt would become more detailed and guide the AI model to handle more complex logical relationships between a premise and a hypothesis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the given premise and hypothesis, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise or not, choosing the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay close attention to the individual components like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Also, provide reasoning for your decisions.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

Pay close attention to the individual components like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Also, provide reasoning for your decisions.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James assumes that Taylor assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing. Hypothesis: James assumes that a man in a black hat, standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James assumes that Taylor assumes that a man in a black hat is standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing. The hypothesis simply states that James assumes that a man in a black hat is standing on the street while playing an electric guitar and singing.

Since the hypothesis is a subset of the premise (it does not include the assumption made by Taylor), there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example Analysis:

In this example, the model is mistaken because it does not correctly interpret the implications of removing Taylor's assumption from the premise to create the hypothesis. The model assumes that, since the hypothesis is a subset of the premise, entailment should be the correct choice. However, this ignores the fact that Taylor's assumption in the premise indicates that the information about the man in the black hat is second-hand. This information is passed from the man in the black hat to Taylor and then to James. When considering the hypothesis, the information is stated to be directly from James, which changes the context and the validity of the information, resulting in a 'non-entailment' situation. 

Reasons for the wrong output:
1. Misunderstanding Indirect Information Flow: The AI model fails to understand the complexity of the assumptions made by multiple people. It sees the information in the hypothesis as a subset of the premise without recognizing the difference in the level of assumption between the two.

2. Incorrect Subset Theory Application: The model assumes that since the hypothesis exists within the premise, there has to be entailment. However, it does not consider the change in context when the level of assumption changes, leading to the wrong answer.

3. Context Misinterpretation: The model fails to observe the shift in context due to the removal of one assumption level (Taylor's assumption) when transitioning from the premise to the hypothesis.

Potential improvements for the prompt:
1. Add more specific instructions: Make instructions clearer that the task is not only to identify if the hypothesis is a subset of the premise but also whether the hypothesis maintains the same logical and contextual implications as the premise.

<START> Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end.

Premise: Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. Hypothesis: Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Olivia knows that people are checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. The hypothesis states that Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut. 

Based on the premise, we can infer that Olivia is aware of the situation where all the doors of the car are open. However, it does not necessarily mean that she knows specifically that a car door has not been shut. It is possible that Olivia is aware of the open doors but does not have knowledge about whether a door has been shut or not. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Examining the wrong answer:

1. Misinterpretation of the Premise: The model demonstrates a misinterpretation of the premise. The premise states that Olivia knows that people are checking out a car with all its doors open. This logically implies that because all the doors are open, it can be concluded that a car door has not been shut (else it would not be open). The model, however, seems to demand more explicit information from the premise to conclude that a door is open because it has not been shut.

2. Lack of Simplistic Logic Application: The model's analysis inextricably ties the 'not shut' state of a car door to potential knowledge about whether a door was shut or not. In truth, the premise already provides sufficient context that a door was not shut because it is open.

Reasons why the prompt may be leading to wrong answers:

a. Complexity of explanation: The prompt requests that the model provide reasoning for its decisions. This could potentially push the model to add complexity to its analysis, leading to the overthinking of simple logical connections.

b. Emphasis on Component Analysis: The prompt heavily emphasizes analysis of individual components. This, again, can complicate the analysis leading to unnecessary deep dives into detail-laden, convoluted interpretations, often resulting in a neglect of simple logical connections.

To improve the prompt:

1. Reduction of Complexity: The prompt could be simpler, requiring the model to provide a basic response without explaining its reasoning unless the logic is convoluted or complex.

2. Strengthening Focus on Logic Application: The prompt could have a clear emphasis on basic logical deduction rather than detailed component analysis. 

3. Clearer Exposition on 'Entailment': The prompt could explain 'entailment' more explicitly, to prevent confusion or incorrect interpretation.

4. Incorporating Known vs Unknown: The prompt could include guidance on considering what is known from the premise and explicitly stated in the hypothesis. 

The modified prompt could hence be: "Analyze the given premise and hypothesis. Identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise, choosing from 'entailment', if it does, or 'non-entailment', if it does not. Consider what is known from the premise and stated in the hypothesis. In most cases, a brief explanation for the decision would suffice."

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph assumes a specific scenario where a man is jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Joseph assumes a man is jumping. The hypothesis does not specify the same detailed actions as mentioned in the premise.

Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise, as the specific actions described in the premise are not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis.

The premise specifically mentions that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball, which does not necessarily mean that Evelyn assumes all children play in the snow.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles understands that there are three young girls and a baby sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. The hypothesis states that Charles understands that there are four people outside. 

Based on the premise, it is clear that Charles is aware of the specific number and composition of individuals outside, which includes three young girls and a baby. However, the hypothesis simply states that Charles understands that there are four people outside without specifying the age or gender of the individuals. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as it introduces new information that is not explicitly stated in the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:

Step by step examination:
In this case, the premise describes "a man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open." The hypothesis simplifies this scene to "a man is jumping." Although the hypothesis is less specific, it still describes a component of the scene outlined in the premise. The model misunderstands that the lack of specific details in the hypothesis does not constitute a 'non-entailment' when the main action identified (jumping) is still consistent in both the premise and hypothesis.

Reasons:
The model seems to take a view that a premise and a hypothesis only entail if the hypothesis mirrors all details of the premise. However, entailment also occurs when the hypothesis is subsumed or logically contained within the premise, even without identical specificity.

Wrong Example 2:

Step by step examination:
Similary in this second case, the premise describes a scene where "there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball", and the hypothesis says "children play in the snow". The hypothesis is less specific, yet, it aligns with a part of the premise's scenario. The model makes a similar mistake by assuming that because the hypothesis does not match the entire premise in detail that there is no entailment, while in fact, the overarching concept of children playing in the snow is consistent between both the premise and the hypothesis.

Reasons:
Here again the model fails to account that entailment can exist even when a hypothesis is a less specific statement that logically follows from the premise.

Wrong Example 3:

Step by step examination:
The premise involves "three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it," and the hypothesis generalizes this to "there are four people outside." Although the hypothesis does not include all the details specified in the premise, its main idea (that there are four people outside) is contained within the premise. The model incorrectly concludes that the absence of specific details in the hypothesis makes it a 'non-entailment.'

Reasons:
The model seems to misunderstand that a hypothesis can be a more general statement than the premise and still entail as long as the primary concept is included. Also, the model incorrectly assumes that the introduction of any new information (that is logically derived and not conflicting) in the hypothesis constitutes a 'non-entailment.'

Improvements for the prompt:
- Clearly define 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt with examples.
- Emphasize that entailment can exist when the hypothesis is a less specific but logically derived statement from the premise.
- Make it clear that a difference in degree of specificity does not necessarily lead to 'non-entailment.'
- Encourage the model to consider the logical consistency of overarching concepts and actions, not merely the presence or absence of specific details in comparison of the premise and the hypothesis.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles understands that three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. Hypothesis: Charles understands that there are four people outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles understands that there are three young girls and a baby sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it. The hypothesis states that Charles understands that there are four people outside. 

Based on the premise, it is clear that Charles is aware of the specific number and composition of individuals outside, which includes three young girls and a baby. However, the hypothesis simply states that Charles understands that there are four people outside without specifying the age or gender of the individuals. Therefore, the hypothesis does not logically follow from the premise as it introduces new information that is not explicitly stated in the premise. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:

Step by step examination:
In this case, the premise describes "a man jumping up in the air and splitting his legs with his mouth open." The hypothesis simplifies this scene to "a man is jumping." Although the hypothesis is less specific, it still describes a component of the scene outlined in the premise. The model misunderstands that the lack of specific details in the hypothesis does not constitute a 'non-entailment' when the main action identified (jumping) is still consistent in both the premise and hypothesis.

Reasons:
The model seems to take a view that a premise and a hypothesis only entail if the hypothesis mirrors all details of the premise. However, entailment also occurs when the hypothesis is subsumed or logically contained within the premise, even without identical specificity.

Wrong Example 2:

Step by step examination:
Similary in this second case, the premise describes a scene where "there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball", and the hypothesis says "children play in the snow". The hypothesis is less specific, yet, it aligns with a part of the premise's scenario. The model makes a similar mistake by assuming that because the hypothesis does not match the entire premise in detail that there is no entailment, while in fact, the overarching concept of children playing in the snow is consistent between both the premise and the hypothesis.

Reasons:
Here again the model fails to account that entailment can exist even when a hypothesis is a less specific statement that logically follows from the premise.

Wrong Example 3:

Step by step examination:
The premise involves "three young girls and a baby are sitting in the grass on a blue blanket with baby toys scattered on it," and the hypothesis generalizes this to "there are four people outside." Although the hypothesis does not include all the details specified in the premise, its main idea (that there are four people outside) is contained within the premise. The model incorrectly concludes that the absence of specific details in the hypothesis makes it a 'non-entailment.'

Reasons:
The model seems to misunderstand that a hypothesis can be a more general statement than the premise and still entail as long as the primary concept is included. Also, the model incorrectly assumes that the introduction of any new information (that is logically derived and not conflicting) in the hypothesis constitutes a 'non-entailment.'

Improvements for the prompt:
- Clearly define 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in the prompt with examples.
- Emphasize that entailment can exist when the hypothesis is a less specific but logically derived statement from the premise.
- Make it clear that a difference in degree of specificity does not necessarily lead to 'non-entailment.'
- Encourage the model to consider the logical consistency of overarching concepts and actions, not merely the presence or absence of specific details in comparison of the premise and the hypothesis.

The correct label is: B

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Charles believes that Robert believes that a guy is attempting to perform a skateboard trick while jumping over part of a white building in an attempt to land on the concrete outside. Hypothesis: Charles believes that a guy is attempting to perform a skateboard trick while jumping over part of a white building in an attempt to land on the concrete outside.

1. Misinterpretation of the premise-hypothesis relationship: The model incorrectly assumes that if "Charles believes that Robert believes X," it automatically means that "Charles believes X." However, these are two different levels of belief and do not logically stem from each other, resulting in the wrong response of 'entailment'. 

2. Confusion over the concept of 'second-hand information': The model might have misinterpreted the part of the prompt stating, "consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information" as the premise breezing over that "Charles believes that Robert believes" is second-hand information, and not an assertion of Charles' own beliefs.

3. Problem in parsing indirect relationships: The model was instructed to consider how indirect or direct relationships are. However, it seems like this aspect was not incorporated into the model's decision-making process, for it assumed a direct belief stemming from Charles, which is not implied in the premise.


Improvement aspects for the prompt:

1. Clarity on second-hand information: The prompt could include a clear direction specifying that second-hand information does not directly imply the beliefs or opinions of the first source. 

2. Detailed understanding of indirect statements: The prompt could be more explicit in directing the model to understand the nuanced difference between direct beliefs and beliefs about others' beliefs in order to avoid such misunderstandings.

3. Distinction between entailment & subset: The prompt must emphasize more on the difference between a hypothesis being a subset of the premise and it being an entailment. The model needs to differentiate clearly between these two scenarios to avoid inaccurate entailment conclusions.

4. Simplify instructions: The prompt could be simplified and made more explicit, placing clear emphasis on key instructions to ensure the model can capture all necessary steps, i.e., examining each component carefully, considering shifts in context and meaning, and ensuring nuanced understanding of indirect and direct relationships.

The hypothesis directly stems from the premise as it is a restatement of the information provided in the premise. The actions and subjects involved in both the premise and hypothesis are the same, with the only difference being the attribution of the assumption to Taylor in the premise and to William in the hypothesis. Since the hypothesis is essentially a repetition of the scenario described in the premise, there is a clear entailment between the two.

The question involves a scenario where Taylor is assuming that William is assuming a certain situation (that a boy at the beach runs through the surf towards three other people who are already in the water). 

The hypothesis, on the other hand, changes the assumption source to just William, removing the intermediate assumption of Taylor. 

The model mistakenly concludes it's an entailment since the scenes described in both the premise and hypothesis are identical. 

It seems to interpret the task as a strict observation of the events occurring in the scenario, ignoring the nuanced element of who is making the assumption. Therefore, it fails in recognizing shifts in assumption levels between the premise and hypothesis.

In truth, this is a non-entailment since the primary source of the assumption is differing.


Reasons for the wrong answer:

1. Underestimation of Shifts in Context: The model fails to recognize the subtle shift in the source of assumption from Taylor to William, thus unable to evaluate the impact on the entailment relationship.

2. Limited Focus on Subjects/Actions: The model overemphasizes the direct events within the scenario - the boy running towards the people on the beach, neglecting the assumption hierarchy (Taylor -> William).

3. Ignorance of Second-Hand Information: The model does not acknowledge the propagation of second-hand information and its impact. In this case, Taylor assuming William's assumption is an additional layer of interpretation that impacts the entailment.


Improvements for the prompt: 

1. Emphasize the Importance of Context: Make it clear the prompt evaluation must not just hinge on the actions or subjects but the assumption source and its levels. 

2. Clarify Second-Hand Information: Include instructions that explicitly state that the model should consider the propagation of second-hand information and its impact on entailment.

3. Fair Assessment of all Components: The prompt needs to give equal weight to all components - subjects, actions, and the source of information.

4. Detailed Explanation: Ask the model to justify its conclusion in detail, ensuring it has fully understood all connections and distinctions between premise and hypothesis.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end. Now, analyze the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

Premise: Taylor assumes that William assumes that a boy at the beach runs through the surf towards three other people who are already in the water. Hypothesis: William assumes that a boy at the beach runs through the surf towards three other people who are already in the water.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relation between the premise and hypothesis is **entailment** <A>. 

The hypothesis directly stems from the premise as it is a restatement of the information provided in the premise. The actions and subjects involved in both the premise and hypothesis are the same, with the only difference being the attribution of the assumption to Taylor in the premise and to William in the hypothesis. Since the hypothesis is essentially a repetition of the scenario described in the premise, there is a clear entailment between the two.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

The model's response is:

Taylor believing that Joseph knows about numerous customers browsing for produce in a market implies that Joseph indeed knows about it. Therefore, the hypothesis logically stems from the premise.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

1. Question Examination: The question asks the AI model to determine if the hypothesis, "Joseph knows that numerous customers are browsing for produce in a market," logically stems from the premise, "Taylor believes that Joseph knows that numerous customers are browsing for produce in a market." 

2. Wrong Answer Examination: The AI model chose option A (entailment), arguing that because Taylor believes that Joseph knows about the customers, Joseph indeed knows about it.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

- Overlooking of Subjectivity: The AI model misinterprets the subjective belief of Taylor as an objective fact. Just because Taylor believes something does not make it factually true or automatic entailment. There is a shift in the level of information between the premise and the hypothesis that has been overlooked.

- Absence of Direct Relationship: The AI model fails to recognize that there is an indirect relationship between the subjects, actions, and objects involved. The fact that Joseph knows something is indirectly related through Taylor's belief, not directly stated.

- Ignorance of Second-hand Information: The command within the prompt to consider the implication of second-hand information has been ignored. Taylor's report about Joseph's knowledge is second-hand information, which does not necessarily confirm the hypothesis.

Improvements for the Prompt:

- Clarify the Meaning of Entailment: Clearly define that entailment implies a direct, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, not influenced by subjective beliefs or assumptions.

- Ask the System to Discern Second-hand Information: Reinforce the direction to distinguish second-hand information or beliefs presented as facts in the premise.

- Emphasize considering shifts in context: Highlight that shifts in context or levels of information should affect the entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis.

- Explicit Description of Relationship: Recommend that the system should specify whether the premise and hypothesis have a direct or indirect relationship.

Premise: Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line. Hypothesis: Abigail assumes that tennis player is playing tennis.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment. The premise states that Abigail assumes the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line, which does not necessarily mean that Abigail assumes the tennis player is playing tennis. The premise only provides information about a specific action related to tennis, not the overall activity of playing tennis. Therefore, the hypothesis cannot be directly inferred from the premise.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1 Analysis:

The prompt misleads the model due to an overemphasis on the literal entailment. Here, the premise is "Abigail assumes that the tennis player spikes the tennis ball on the boundary line", and the hypothesis is "Abigail assumes the tennis player is playing tennis". Spiking the tennis ball on the boundary line is an action that is inherently part of the game of tennis. Thus, even though the such action doesn't comprehensively cover all activities in the sport, it still signifies that the person is engaged in playing tennis. The faulty reasoning of the model thus appears to arise from a too literal interpretation of all actions, subjects, and objects involved, instead of focusing on the inherent link between the premise and hypothesis.

The overemphasis on the source of information might have also led the model astray. The model focuses heavily on who is stating the information and whether the information is second-hand or direct. In this task, we're considering Abigail's assumption about a situation, which inherently has some degree of subjectivity. While it’s important to consider the source and subjectivity, this shouldn’t override direct inferences that can be drawn in cases such as this.

Suggested improvements:

1. Simplify the instruction: The model seems to get confused with overly long and complex instructions. A simplified instruction could improve the model's understanding.
2. Emphasize an inherent entailment: The prompt needs to clarify that while all aspects of the premise may not cover the hypothesis, as long as there is an inherent entailment, the answer should be 'entailment'.
3. Balance the focus on literal entailment and inferred entailment: In the prompt, offer explicit guidance for considering both literal entailment and inferred entailment.
4. Adjust the focus on the source of information: Ensure the model understands that the source of information is only one aspect of assessment, not the determining factor.
5. Provide concrete examples: Include examples demonstrating the difference between direct and indirect, and subjective and objective information, and how these can change the entailment of a premise and hypothesis. This will reduce the ambiguity for the model when solving similar problems.

(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given premise and hypothesis, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise or not, choosing the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay close attention to the individual components like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Also, provide reasoning for your decisions.
(2) Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end. Now, analyze the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

<START> Your task involves evaluating the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis. The nature of this relationship is to be expressed as either 'entailment', where the hypothesis directly follows from the premise, or 'non-entailment', where the hypothesis cannot be inferred directly from the premise. Bear in mind, the hypothesis could encompass some elements of the premise, but this alone doesn't signify entailment. Particularly, you should take into account the subjects, actions, and objects, and understand their relationships. Attention should be paid to potential contextual shifts which may alter the intended meaning. Consider whether the information is first or second-hand and how that influences the directness of the relationship. Importantly, when assessing the connection, consider both literal and inferred entailments. An 'entailment' should exist if there is an inherent link or natural progression between the premise and hypothesis, regardless of the level of subjectivity in the information. Always justify and explain your decision in the end. Below, you will find a premise and hypothesis. Identify the relationship between them and choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as your answer. Please provide your judgement alongside your chosen option at the end. <END>

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
The error in this example arises from the instruction in the prompt not clearly emphasizing the subtlety of indirectness in the connection between a premise and a hypothesis. In the given dialogue, the information is second-hand, meaning it's not directly from William, but from Emma's assumptions about what William thinks. The model assumed that because the information in the hypothesis is the same as what Emma assumes William believes, there is an entailment. This erroneous judgment comes from not sufficiently distinguishing between direct and indirect information.

Step by Step Analysis:

The premise indicates that Emma assumes what William believes, meaning that it's not a direct statement from William himself. The hypothesis, however, presents William's belief as a fact. There's a layer of uncertainty because the information is second-hand and based on Emma's assumption.

The model erroneously found an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis because it did not account for the indirectness of the source in the premise.

Reasons for Error:
1. The model may overlook indirect relationships and subtleties in the flow of information because the prompt lacked clear instructions on addressing second-hand or subjective information.
2. The instructions did not make an explicit distinction between direct factual statements and second-hand information assumed to be factual. 

Improvement Suggestion:
1. The prompt needs to explicitly instruction the model to scrutinize the sources of the information in both the premise and the hypothesis.
2. The prompt should emphasize differences between direct and indirect information and stress the need to consider assumptions as potentially false.
3. The prompt should clarify that the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not simply a comparison of content, but also considers the reliability and directness of their sources and information levels.
4. The prompt should state that information, even if identical in content, can have altered implications depending on whether it's delivered directly or indirectly. 
5. The instructions should highlight the importance of assessing the certainty of the beliefs presented in the premise and the hypothesis.

3. The prompt should clarify that the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is not simply a comparison of content, but also considers the reliability and directness of their sources and information levels.
4. The prompt should state that information, even if identical in content, can have altered implications depending on whether it's delivered directly or indirectly. 
5. The instructions should highlight the importance of assessing the certainty of the beliefs presented in the premise and the hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the given premise and hypothesis, identify if the hypothesis logically follows from the premise or not, choosing the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay close attention to the individual components like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Also, provide reasoning for your decisions.
(2) Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end. Now, analyze the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
(3) For this task, your role is to assess the relationship between the presented premise and the hypothesis. Your options to describe this relationship are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, the hypothesis might include some aspects of the premise, but this doesn't mean that the premise automatically entails the hypothesis. Beware of variations in context, as these can transform original meanings or assumptions - these variations could be changes in the source of the information, the level of the information, or the transition from direct to second-hand information. Be scrupulous in your judgment, considering the flow of information, possible shifts in meaning and the change in assumption levels. It's mandatory to analyze all components of the premise and the hypothesis, paying careful attention to subjects, actions, and objects involved, noting the directness or indirectness of their relationships. It's not only about what is said, but also who says it and the information's distance from the initial source. In the case of second-hand information or subjective beliefs, consider whether they are presented as actual facts. An entailment suggests a direct, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, not swayed by subjective beliefs. Always rationalise your choices and supply a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end, clarifying whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect. Now, analyze the following premises and hypotheses and ascertain their relationship, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

<START> For this exercise, you need to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Your task is to determine if this connection is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay special attention to the nature of information in both premise and hypothesis: direct assertions or possible assumptions made by any character about another's belief. Hypotheses may contain elements from the premise but do not automatically prove entailment. Beware of shifts in context such as changes in the messenger, or degree of directness of the information in both premise and hypothesis, since these may alter the original meanings or assumptions. It's equally important to consider the dynamics of second-hand information and its impact. Unpack each premise and each hypothesis, scrutinizing every element, like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Gauge the nature of the relationships - direct or indirect - between these elements, and note that similar content can carry different implications depending on their transmission pathway. Remember to analyze if subjective beliefs or second-hand input are presented as unquestionable truths. A true entailment suggests an unambiguous, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, in which subjective beliefs do not intervene. In every step of your analysis, be meticulous, rationalize your choices carefully, and provide a comprehensive reasoning for your decisions. It is essential to be exact whether the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is straightforward or indirect. Now, evaluate the ensuing premises and hypotheses and decide their linkage, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. <END>

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment. The premise states that David suspects that Abigail understands that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home, but it does not directly state that David suspects a man actually takes a drink in the doorway of a home. The hypothesis goes beyond what is explicitly mentioned in the premise, making it a non-entailment relationship.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

The question is: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: David suspects that Abigail understands that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home. Hypothesis: David suspects that a man takes a drink in the doorway of a home.

The model's response is: The relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment. 

The correct label is: A. 
The model's prediction is: B. 

The major issue here seems to be the misunderstanding of the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, particularly how it handles 'understands' and 'suspects'. In the model's explanation, it saw the hypothesis as going beyond what was explicitly stated in the premise, hence the choice of non-entailment. It overlooked the fact that David's suspicions encompass the hypothesis, making it an entailment. 

This misinterpretation highlights a lack of understanding of the nested structure of suspicions and understanding, leading to the errant judgement. It further fails to take into account that the lack of directness does not necessarily hinder an entailment. 

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Enhance Clarity on Entailment: The prompt could be clearer about how entailments work, indicating that nested concepts such as suspicions or beliefs can still entail a hypothesis even if they aren't explicitly stated.
2. Address Information Levels: The prompt should clarify how various levels or sources of information affect entailment, particularly in the case of nested beliefs or suspicions.
3. Improve Nested Relationship Understanding: The prompt needs to address how to analyze the nested relationship and indirect way of expression. Instructions might cover how to interpret statements of understanding or suspicion and how these can entail subsequent hypotheses. 
4. Address Interpretation Limitations: The prompt can explain that not only the direct relationship should be considered. Even subtle or indirect relationships can lead to entailment. Therefore, the model needs to exercise more cautious judgment when analyzing entailment.
5. Define or explain 'direct', 'indirect', 'first-hand', 'second-hand' correctly: The prompt could further elaborate on these particular terms and how they relate to entailment to avoid mischaracterization.
6. Substantiate the reasoning: The prompt could emphasize that the reasoning should always be substantial in the decision-making process for the relationship between premise and hypothesis. It is not only about what's explicitly stated but how concepts relate and create a logical sequence.
7. Mixed Information: The prompt could explain how to handle scenarios where the premise includes mixed levels of information or beliefs within beliefs, and how these situations can result in entailment.
8. Offer Examples: The prompt could provide examples with different variations in context, level of information, source of information, and level of assumptions to increase understanding and alignment on what's entailment and what's not.

<START> This task assigns you the role of an assessor responsible for delineating the relationship between a given premise and a hypothesis. Your choices to describe this relationship are either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. It is crucial to note that even though a hypothesis may encompass aspects of the premise, it does not axiomatically result in an entailment. Be vigilant about possible contextual shifts, which may include changes in the source of information, the depth or subjectivity of the information, or even the transformation of primary information into secondary or tertiary information. These shifts can effectively revamp the initial meanings or assumptions. Exercise careful judgement, taking into account the information flow, possible shifts in connotation and subtle changes in assumption levels. Thoroughly analyse all parts of the premise and the hypothesis, with due emphasis on subjects, actions, and objects involved. Evaluate the relationship they share — is it direct or indirect? The focus isn't merely on the content of the information, but also its originator and how far removed it is from the primary source. In instances of secondary information or subjective interpretations, assess whether they are presented as factual. Entailment implies a direct, factual correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, undistorted by personal beliefs. Always structure your judgement rationally and provide a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end. Clarify whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect. Remember, indirect relationships or those obscured within another's understanding or belief can still imply entailment; care must be taken to identify such nuanced relationships. Now, apply this knowledge to the following premises and hypotheses to determine their relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. At the end, bracket your answer as <answer> and </answer>.

For example:
Premise: John believes that Mark thinks that a woman is in the kitchen. 
Hypothesis: John believes that a woman is in the kitchen.
Explain your reasoning and categorize this relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 

This lays the groundwork for what entailment can entail, even in more layered or complex scenarios. Remember, the key is in the careful interpretation and in-depth understanding of the premise and the hypothesis.

Now, proceed to the actual task! Evaluate the premise and the hypothesis, settle on 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and write your comprehensive explanation. <END>

Exercise careful judgement, taking into account the information flow, possible shifts in connotation and subtle changes in assumption levels. Thoroughly analyse all parts of the premise and the hypothesis, with due emphasis on subjects, actions, and objects involved. Evaluate the relationship they share — is it direct or indirect? The focus isn't merely on the content of the information, but also its originator and how far removed it is from the primary source. In instances of secondary information or subjective interpretations, assess whether they are presented as factual. Entailment implies a direct, factual correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, undistorted by personal beliefs. Always structure your judgement rationally and provide a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end. Clarify whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect. Remember, indirect relationships or those obscured within another's understanding or belief can still imply entailment; care must be taken to identify such nuanced relationships. Now, apply this knowledge to the following premises and hypotheses to determine their relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. At the end, bracket your answer as <answer> and </answer>.

For example:
Premise: John believes that Mark thinks that a woman is in the kitchen. 
Hypothesis: John believes that a woman is in the kitchen.
Explain your reasoning and categorize this relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 

This lays the groundwork for what entailment can entail, even in more layered or complex scenarios. Remember, the key is in the careful interpretation and in-depth understanding of the premise and the hypothesis.

Now, proceed to the actual task! Evaluate the premise and the hypothesis, settle on 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and write your comprehensive explanation.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not naturally follow from the premise. Just because William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread, it does not necessarily mean that William himself thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment. 

Therefore, the answer is:
(B) non-entailment
<answer>(B)</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

1) Wrong Example Analysis:

Question:
Premise: William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Hypothesis: William thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread.
Options: (A) entailment, (B) non-entailment

Wrong Answer:
The hypothesis does not naturally follow from the premise. Just because William thinks that Michael knows that a woman in an apron is looking for bread, it does not necessarily mean that William himself thinks that a woman in an apron is looking for bread. Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment. 

The explanation here is incorrect because William's belief about Michael's knowledge implies that William himself is aware of the situation (i.e., a woman in an apron is looking for bread). If William thinks that Michael knows this situation, it suggests that he, William, also knows and thinks it. 

The language model seems to misunderstand the nested structure of knowledge/belief in the premise. The instruction of "simple logical interpretation" might lead the model to straightforwardly consider the surface structure without digging deeper into the implicational relationship between the premise and hypothesis.

2) Suggested Improvements:

a) More guidance on interpreting indirect implications or complex linguistic structures.

b) Examples showcasing the relationship between premise and hypothesis in both direct and indirect ways.

c) Specific instructions on how to handle language structure with nested beliefs or knowledge to encourage the model to analyze from a commonly accepted cognitive perspective.

Revised Prompt:
Consider the given premise and hypothesis. Evaluate if the hypothesis is entailed within the premise using logical interpretation, bearing in mind both direct and indirect implications that can be drawn based on the available information. Choose 'entailment', if the hypothesis naturally follows or can be reasonably inferred from the premise, or 'non-entailment', if the connection is not sufficiently established.
For complex linguistic structures such as nested beliefs or knowledge, consider the fact that when someone thinks another person knows something, it generally implies they themselves know it.
Give an explanation for your choice, the simpler, the better, but do not shy from detailed reasoning if the logic is intricate.

gradient:
<1> 

The question provides a premise and a hypothesis and asks if the hypothesis naturally follows from the premise. The premise describes a setting where Thomas recognizes two boys dressed in specific ways. The hypothesis is about the location and activity of the two boys. The model's prediction, considering the information given, is logically sound — a correct analysis of the given statements might consider this a non-entailment since the premise does not provide any specifics about them being in a classroom or sitting at desks.

Step 1: Inspection
The language model considers the details provided in the premise and naturally infers that the hypothesis does not follow. It concludes this because the information about them being in a classroom or sitting at desks is not present in the premise.

Step 2: Why the Answer is Wrong
Going by the instructions given in the prompt, the model provides a logical analysis based on the explicit information provided in the premise and hypothesis. The correct label, as stated to be A (entailment), might be due to some implicit or intrinsic relation that is not immediately evident in the provided premise and hypothesis, that is not on a chalkboard interpretation level.

Step 3: The Scope for Improvement

1. Clarify the Level of Interpretation: The prompt asks the model to use a "simple logical interpretation," which might have led the model to analyze the text on a literal level rather than considering any deeper or implicit meanings. However, this is tricky because we want the model to be precise and not imagine or assume information not provided. The depths of interpretation acceptable should be clearer.

2. Examples of Implicit Relations: If the task is intended to identify implicit relations, the prompt must provide examples of acceptable levels of assumed relations. It must specify how far the logical leaps for implications could go.

3. Explain Key Concepts: The concept of 'entailment' in natural language processing and computational linguistics might differ from common-sense interpretation. A clear definition of 'entailment' and 'non-entailment' in this context could guide the model’s response.

The prompt might be improved by addressing these points. For instance, it could clarify that the model should consider both explicit and implicit (contextually inferred) information or shared knowledge when determining whether the hypothesis naturally follows from the premise.

Premise: Robert suspects that Thomas understands that a male baseball player for the baseball team The Indians prepares to catch a ball. Hypothesis: Thomas understands that a male baseball player for the baseball team The Indians prepares to catch a ball.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis naturally follows from the premise. If Robert suspects that Thomas understands something, it implies that Thomas actually does understand it. Therefore, the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. 

Therefore, the answer is:
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Premise: Charles recognizes that a tennis player in blue shorts and a white shirt making an aggressive backhand swing towards the tennis ball. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The hypothesis does not naturally follow from the premise. Just because Charles recognizes a tennis player making a backhand swing does not necessarily mean he recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket. It is possible that Charles only noticed the player's attire and movement, but not the racket itself. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) non-entailment

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1:

Question: Robert suspects that Thomas understands that a male baseball player for the baseball team The Indians prepares to catch a ball. Hypothesis: Thomas understands that a male baseball player for the baseball team The Indians prepares to catch a ball.
Wrong Answer: (A) entailment

Examining the question: The question provides a premise where Robert has a suspicion about Thomas' understanding. The hypothesis simply states Thomas' understanding without referring to Robert's suspicion.

Looking at the answer: The model made an errant assumption by translating suspicion as fact. It assumed that if Robert suspects something, it is indeed true. However, suspicion does not guarantee truth, so it can't be considered as a valid premise to establish entailment.

Example 2:

Question: Charles recognizes that a tennis player in blue shorts and a white shirt making an aggressive backhand swing towards the tennis ball. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket.
Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment

Examining the question: The premise describes Charles identifying a detailed scenario, a tennis player making an aggressive backhand swing. The hypothesis brings the situation to a more general recognition, that a person is holding a tennis racket.

Looking at the answer: The model, in this case, overly restricts the premise's scope. It failed to deduce that a tennis player making a swing ought to be holding a tennis racket, thus leading to the conclusion that the hypothesis couldn't be derived from the premise.

Example 3:

Question: William believes that the man is sweeping with a red broom. Hypothesis: William believes that the man is sweeping dirt.
Wrong Answer: (B) non-entailment

Examining the question: The premise tells us that William thinks a man is using a red broom to sweep. The hypothesis implicitly suggests that the sweeping action involves sweeping dirt.

Looking at the answer: The model failed to infer the purpose of the sweeping action - it took the premise too literally allowing for the possibility of sweeping without dirt.

Improvements to the prompt:

1. Clarification of entailment: Clarify that entailment implies the hypothesis must be a guarantee if the premise is true.
2. Be specific about the interpretation of emotions and beliefs: Point out that suspicions, beliefs, and emotions are subjective and do not establish facts. Therefore, these should be analyzed from a logical perspective rather than a factual perspective.
3. Emphasize inference: Make it clear that the model should look for not just explicit facts, but logical implications or inferences made from the provided statements.
4. Understand generalization: Train the prompt to understand that a specific situation can be generalized to a larger concept, like recognizing a tennis player swinging a racket leads to recognizing someone holding a racket.
5. Discourage too literal interpretations: The model should understand a premise's purpose or intention instead of just its literal meaning, such as sweeping with a broom implies sweeping dirt.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
In the first example, the error results from a misunderstanding of the entailment in language. The model was over-focused on the uncertainty introduced by the word "assumes". The model keyed into the phrase "Ava assumes," which it described as implying uncertainty about Charles's beliefs. However, the logic of entailment here is more about the proposition that Ava is making about Charles's beliefs, not the certainty of those beliefs. In the realm of premises and conclusions, Ava's assumption about Charles's belief operates as a fact. Therefore, the premise does entail the hypothesis.

The prompt draws particular attention to verbs, speculative nature, and subjectivity. Guiding the model to give too much weight to these concepts may lead to this form of mistake. Rather than focusing extensively on verbs or subjectivity, the model should be guided to observe the exact statement made in the premise and the claim made in the hypothesis to understand their logical relationship.

Wrong Example 2:
In the second example, the issue concerns the model's understanding of the logical flow within a chain of understanding or belief. The premise indicates that Ava "believes that Abigail understands that two people play horseshoes" and the hypothesis simplifies this to "Ava believes that two people play horseshoes." The model misjudged this as non-entailment, reasoning that Ava could believe that Abigail understands something without believing it herself.

This indicates that the model may be struggling with understanding the hierarchical structure of beliefs presented in the premise, and that tweaking the prompt to better draw attention to these structures could result in improved performance.

Prompt Improvement:
1. The prompt could place more emphasis on understanding the logical flow presented in the premise and hypothesis, rather than focusing exclusively on the verbs or the existence subjectivity or speculation.

2. It’s important to remind the model to consider the sentences in the context of entailment logic rather than real-world truth or certainty.

3. The prompt could guide the model to evaluate the hierarchical structure of beliefs or assumptions within the premise.

4. The model should pay sufficient attention to the core claims in both the premise and the hypothesis, not overemphasize on the perceived certainty of events.

A helpful rewrite could include: "Carefully analyze the exact statements in the premises and hypotheses to understand if there is a logical entailment between them. Remember that the factual or speculative nature of the premise does not impede an entailment. Similarly, the hierarchical structure of the beliefs in the premise should not be misconstrued. Evaluate the main propositions in both the premise and the hypothesis to discern their logical relationship. You can then select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', explain your reasoning, and bracket your choice as <answer> and </answer>."

Remember that the factual or speculative nature of the premise does not impede an entailment. Similarly, the hierarchical structure of the beliefs in the premise should not be misconstrued. Evaluate the main propositions in both the premise and the hypothesis to discern their logical relationship. You can then select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', explain your reasoning, and bracket your choice as <answer> and </answer>."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava suspects that Emma learns that a woman swings on a rope overlooking a red farmhouse and gated pastures and tall trees. Hypothesis: Emma learns that a woman swings on a rope overlooking a red farmhouse and gated pastures and tall trees.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Ava suspects that Emma learns about a woman swinging on a rope overlooking specific scenery. The hypothesis directly states that Emma learns about the same woman and scenery. Since the hypothesis directly aligns with the information presented in the premise, there is an entailment between the two.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis.

Premise: Taylor suspects that David recognizes that a man wearing black pants and a helmet is riding a brown horse. Hypothesis: David recognizes that a man wearing black pants and a helmet is riding a brown horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Taylor suspects that David recognizes a specific situation. However, suspicion does not necessarily imply certainty. Therefore, the premise does not definitively establish that David actually recognizes the situation described. Without further evidence or confirmation, it cannot be concluded that David recognizes the man wearing black pants and a helmet riding a brown horse. Therefore, the hypothesis is not entailed by the premise.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B

Premise: David suspects that man in robe making designs on dirt ground. Hypothesis: David suspects that a man making designs in the dirt outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<non-entailment>
The premise states that David suspects a man in a robe making designs on the dirt ground, while the hypothesis suggests that David suspects a man making designs in the dirt outside. The key difference is the presence of a robe in the premise, which is not mentioned in the hypothesis. This discrepancy indicates that the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise, leading to a non-entailment relationship.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
In this example, the language model appears to have misunderstood the term "suspect" in the premise to mean "knows for a fact". It is treating the premise as though it definitively asserts what Emma learns, leading to the conclusion that the hypothesis is true. However, the fact that Ava "suspects" something doesn't necessarily make that thing true, so it doesn't entail the hypothesis.

<2>
On the other hand, in this scenario, the language model correctly interprets the subjective verb "suspects" to mean that no definitive claim is being made about what David recognizes. However, it seems to make an error in stating its prediction. Even though its reasoning leads to the conclusion that the statement does not entail the hypothesis (which is correct), it still labels its prediction as 'A' (entailment). This might be due to an uncaught mistake in parsing or transcribing the answer selection.

<3>
The language model seems to have taken a very literal approach to the task. It noticed the difference between the robe mentioned in the premise, and its absence in the hypothesis and concluded that this difference leads to non-entailment. However, the absence of the robe in the hypothesis doesn’t change the main action perceived by David in the premise, because "a man making designs in the dirt" still matches the main action described in the premise. The model seems to focus too heavily on identical phrasing rather than considering overall context and meaning.

Based on these misunderstandings, possible improvements for the prompt include:

1. Explain more precisely the meaning of terms such as "suspect", "believe", and "know", emphasizing that subjective verbs or expressions of uncertainty do not entail the truth of a proposition.
   
2. Make it more clear that the semantics of the premise and the hypothesis need to correspond entirely, but not necessarily in absolute phrasing or explicit information portrayal. Try to make the model understand that implicit info also can lead to entailment.

3. It is significant to recognize that prompt completely relies on the model’s ability to correctly process and interpret linguistic structures, especially subjective verbs. Perhaps include clear instructions for the model for handling hypothetical or uncertain situations.

4. Emphasize that the model should carefully cross-verify its final answer with the detailed explanation it has given, to avoid any inconsistency between predicted label and the underlying reasoning.

gradient:
<1> 
The model incorrectly predicts `'entailment'` between the premise and the hypothesis, primarily due to misunderstanding the change of order in the subjects. It fails to recognize the shift in the knowledge holder from "Michael" to "Sophia", which changes the context of the situation entirely. The prompt instructions may not be clear enough in emphasizing the relevance of order and hierarchy in interpreting comprehension tasks.

<2> 
Again, the model incorrectly predicts `'entailment'`. Similar to the first example, it fails to recognize the reversal of the subjects’ roles in the Hypothesis. The model appears to treat the situation as unconditional, when in reality it is subjective to the individuals’ knowledge and belief. The prompt needs to emphasize a more careful interpretation of individual identities, especially when dealing with nested belief or knowledge scenarios.

<3> 
This example correctly achieves `non-entailment` but has an incorrect prediction label attributed to it. The model correctly identifies that the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis as "John's belief about Amelia's assumption does not prove that Amelia's assumption is correct". But the model's prediction is wrongly flagged as `A`, when it should be `B`. Thus, the actual problem lies in the mislabeling of the model's prediction, not with the model's comprehension or the prompt.

Prompt Improvement Recommendations:
1. Instruct the model to analyze identity roles and their order in the context, as it significantly affects the interpretation of complex compound scenarios. Added focus on who is the primary owner/origin of an assumption, belief or comprehension is critical.
2. The model should especially pay close attention to scenarios with nested beliefs or comprehensions. The existence of beliefs within beliefs can manipulate the meaning drastically, and does not automatically equate to the beliefs being factual.
3. The prompt could request the model to scrutinize the subject, action, and object in each statement, as slight modifications in these areas can transform the overall context of understanding.
4. Review prediction label attributions to ensure they reflect the correct answer choices.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Michael learns that Sophia suspects that two boys, surrounded by paper pieces, hold a third boys shirt to prevent him from grabbing a bag. Hypothesis: Sophia suspects that Michael learns that two boys, surrounded by paper pieces, hold a third boys shirt to prevent him from grabbing a bag.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise and hypothesis are essentially the same, with the only difference being the order of the names "Michael" and "Sophia". Since the actions and entities described are identical in both the premise and hypothesis, there is an entailment between them.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Premise: James understands that William suspects that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts. Hypothesis: William suspects that James understands that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James understands that William suspects a specific scenario. The hypothesis states that William suspects that James understands the same scenario. Since the hypothesis is directly derived from the premise without any additional information or change in the scenario, there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. Hypothesis: Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. This does not necessarily mean that Amelia actually assumes that. John's belief about Amelia's assumption does not guarantee the truth of the assumption itself. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the answer is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1> 
The model incorrectly predicts `'entailment'` between the premise and the hypothesis, primarily due to misunderstanding the change of order in the subjects. It fails to recognize the shift in the knowledge holder from "Michael" to "Sophia", which changes the context of the situation entirely. The prompt instructions may not be clear enough in emphasizing the relevance of order and hierarchy in interpreting comprehension tasks.

<2> 
Again, the model incorrectly predicts `'entailment'`. Similar to the first example, it fails to recognize the reversal of the subjects’ roles in the Hypothesis. The model appears to treat the situation as unconditional, when in reality it is subjective to the individuals’ knowledge and belief. The prompt needs to emphasize a more careful interpretation of individual identities, especially when dealing with nested belief or knowledge scenarios.

<3> 
This example correctly achieves `non-entailment` but has an incorrect prediction label attributed to it. The model correctly identifies that the premise does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis as "John's belief about Amelia's assumption does not prove that Amelia's assumption is correct". But the model's prediction is wrongly flagged as `A`, when it should be `B`. Thus, the actual problem lies in the mislabeling of the model's prediction, not with the model's comprehension or the prompt.

Prompt Improvement Recommendations:
1. Instruct the model to analyze identity roles and their order in the context, as it significantly affects the interpretation of complex compound scenarios. Added focus on who is the primary owner/origin of an assumption, belief or comprehension is critical.
2. The model should especially pay close attention to scenarios with nested beliefs or comprehensions. The existence of beliefs within beliefs can manipulate the meaning drastically, and does not automatically equate to the beliefs being factual.
3. The prompt could request the model to scrutinize the subject, action, and object in each statement, as slight modifications in these areas can transform the overall context of understanding.
4. Review prediction label attributions to ensure they reflect the correct answer choices.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John learns that Charlotte assumes that players from two opposing teams wearing colorful cleats struggle to gain control over a ball on an AstroTurf field. Hypothesis: Charlotte assumes that John learns that players from two opposing teams wearing colorful cleats struggle to gain control over a ball on an AstroTurf field.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that John learns that Charlotte assumes a specific situation involving players from two opposing teams wearing colorful cleats struggling to gain control over a ball on an AstroTurf field. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that Charlotte assumes that John learns the same situation. 

Analyzing the subjects, verbs, and objects in both the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that the main focus is on the actions of learning and assuming, as well as the specific scenario described. The nested nature of the beliefs in the premise adds complexity to the situation.

Considering the context and the order of subjects and their beliefs, it is clear that the premise entails the hypothesis. This is because the premise establishes the initial belief held by Charlotte, which is then learned by John. Therefore, the hypothesis, which states that Charlotte assumes that John learns the same situation, is a logical consequence of the information provided in the premise.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Options:
(A) entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Thomas believes that William understands that a person with a green backpack is riding a bike down the road. This implies that Thomas has a belief about William's understanding of the situation.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that William understands that a person with a green backpack is riding a bike down the road. This aligns with Thomas' belief in the premise.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the premise entails the hypothesis because if Thomas believes that William understands something, then the hypothesis that William understands that same thing is logically consistent.

Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Premise: Richard learns that Isabella thinks that a man looks mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert. Hypothesis: Isabella thinks that a man looks mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Richard learns about Isabella's belief regarding a man looking mysterious in a blue shirt and a red truck for a company called Wilbert. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly attributes this belief to Isabella herself.

Analyzing the subjects, verbs, and objects in both the premise and the hypothesis, we see that the subject in the premise is Richard, the verb is "learns," and the object is Isabella's belief about a man's appearance. In the hypothesis, the subject is Isabella, the verb is "thinks," and the object is the same belief about a man's appearance.

Considering the context, the premise indicates that Richard is aware of Isabella's opinion, but it does not necessarily mean that Isabella herself holds that belief. It is possible that Richard misunderstood or misinterpreted Isabella's thoughts. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Joseph learns that Olivia assumes that a sunglasses vendor gazes into the distance. This implies that Joseph has acquired knowledge about Olivia's assumption regarding the sunglasses vendor's actions.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that Olivia assumes that Joseph learns that a sunglasses vendor gazes into the distance. This statement indicates Olivia's belief about Joseph's knowledge regarding the sunglasses vendor's actions.

Considering the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is evident that the premise entails the hypothesis. Joseph's learning about Olivia's assumption directly leads to Olivia assuming that Joseph has acquired the same knowledge.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
In all four examples, the model presents a very logical and well-articulated rationale for its answers, which highlights that the model comprehends the task and can analyze the presented scenarios on an advanced syntactic level. However, it fails to grasp the semantic difference between a person acquiring knowledge about someone's belief or assumption and that person being aware of this fact.

<1> The model fails to recognize a crucial aspect of the hypothesis, namely that it claims that Charlotte assumes that John has learned her beliefs. While the premise shows that John does learn what Charlotte is assuming, it doesn't imply that Charlotte is aware of John's understanding of her assumption. This key misunderstanding leads to the wrong prediction of "entailment."

<2> For the second example, the model matches the nested statement in the premise with the hypothesis and hence chooses entailment. Nevertheless, Thomas believing that William understands specific circumstances does not necessarily mean that William does understand it. It's only Thomas's belief or assumption, and the premise doesn't support that William has the understanding Thomas thinks he has.

<3> The error in the third example can be seen as quite subtle. The model argues that since Richard learns about Isabella's belief, this doesn't necessarily mean Isabella holds this belief, which is not correct. The fact that Richard learns about Isabella's thought implies that Isabella thinks so, as the passage doesn't indicate any sense of doubt or unreliability in the premise.

<4> Similar to the first example, the model fails to recognize that Olivia assuming that Joseph learns about her assumption does not necessarily mean Joseph does learn it. 

From all these reasons, it can be seen that there are two main areas that contribute to the model's errors:

1. Assuming such-based verbs imply their content: The verbs like 'learns' and 'believes' that shows someone has knowledge or assumes something doesn't always validate the content known or assumed.

2. Awareness between parties: The model struggles to distinguish between a character knowing something and another character being aware of this fact. 

Possible improvements:

1. Make the model aware of the semantic implications of a 'belief' versus a 'fact'. The model should not assume the content of a learned belief or an assumption to be validated truth unless directly stated.

2. The model needs to be explicitly guided to recognize the difference between one party knowing something and another party being aware of that knowledge. Codifying this distinction into the prompts may lead to improvement.

3. The prompt should direct the model to pay closer attention to the exact language and details in the hypothesis, to ensure that it does not inadvertently add information that is not specified in the premise. 

4. The prompt should emphasize that every statement in a hypothesis must be explicitly or implicitly supported by the premise to classify the relationship as 'entailment'.

Considering the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, it is evident that the premise entails the hypothesis. Joseph's learning about Olivia's assumption directly leads to Olivia assuming that Joseph has acquired the same knowledge.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
In all four examples, the model presents a very logical and well-articulated rationale for its answers, which highlights that the model comprehends the task and can analyze the presented scenarios on an advanced syntactic level. However, it fails to grasp the semantic difference between a person acquiring knowledge about someone's belief or assumption and that person being aware of this fact.

<1> The model fails to recognize a crucial aspect of the hypothesis, namely that it claims that Charlotte assumes that John has learned her beliefs. While the premise shows that John does learn what Charlotte is assuming, it doesn't imply that Charlotte is aware of John's understanding of her assumption. This key misunderstanding leads to the wrong prediction of "entailment."

<2> For the second example, the model matches the nested statement in the premise with the hypothesis and hence chooses entailment. Nevertheless, Thomas believing that William understands specific circumstances does not necessarily mean that William does understand it. It's only Thomas's belief or assumption, and the premise doesn't support that William has the understanding Thomas thinks he has.

<3> The error in the third example can be seen as quite subtle. The model argues that since Richard learns about Isabella's belief, this doesn't necessarily mean Isabella holds this belief, which is not correct. The fact that Richard learns about Isabella's thought implies that Isabella thinks so, as the passage doesn't indicate any sense of doubt or unreliability in the premise.

<4> Similar to the first example, the model fails to recognize that Olivia assuming that Joseph learns about her assumption does not necessarily mean Joseph does learn it. 

From all these reasons, it can be seen that there are two main areas that contribute to the model's errors:

1. Assuming such-based verbs imply their content: The verbs like 'learns' and 'believes' that shows someone has knowledge or assumes something doesn't always validate the content known or assumed.

2. Awareness between parties: The model struggles to distinguish between a character knowing something and another character being aware of this fact. 

Possible improvements:

1. Make the model aware of the semantic implications of a 'belief' versus a 'fact'. The model should not assume the content of a learned belief or an assumption to be validated truth unless directly stated.

2. The model needs to be explicitly guided to recognize the difference between one party knowing something and another party being aware of that knowledge. Codifying this distinction into the prompts may lead to improvement.

3. The prompt should direct the model to pay closer attention to the exact language and details in the hypothesis, to ensure that it does not inadvertently add information that is not specified in the premise. 

4. The prompt should emphasize that every statement in a hypothesis must be explicitly or implicitly supported by the premise to classify the relationship as 'entailment'.

Premise: Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction. Hypothesis: Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Michael suspects that Charles learns about the presence of eight tourists standing at a railing looking at an attraction. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction.

Analyzing the subjects, verbs, and objects in both the premise and hypothesis, we can see that the premise involves nested beliefs where Michael suspects that Charles learns about the tourists. The hypothesis, however, does not mention Charles at all and directly states Michael's suspicion about the tourists.

Given this analysis, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because the hypothesis does not include the additional layer of Charles learning about the tourists. Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) non-entailment

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Premise: Emma remembers that a group of young men are dumping soil onto the ground of their backyard. Hypothesis: James remembers that the young men are working outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Emma remembers a specific group of young men dumping soil onto the ground of their backyard. The subject of the premise is Emma, the verb is "remembers," and the object is the action of the young men dumping soil. 

The hypothesis, on the other hand, suggests that James remembers that the young men are working outside. The subject of the hypothesis is James, the verb is "remembers," and the object is the young men working outside.

Based on the information provided, there is no direct connection between Emma's observation of the young men dumping soil and James' belief that they are working outside. Emma's memory does not necessarily entail James' memory, as they are focused on different aspects of the situation. Emma's observation of the young men dumping soil does not automatically mean that James remembers them working outside.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Ava thinks that James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall. This implies that Ava believes James has knowledge of the situation involving the blue kayak and the small waterfall.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Ava thinks that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall. This does not necessarily mean that Ava believes James knows about it; it only indicates Ava's belief about the blue kayak and the waterfall.

Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis because the premise involves Ava's belief about James knowing, while the hypothesis focuses solely on Ava's belief about the situation with the blue kayak and the waterfall.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

(B) non-entailment

Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Sophia believes that William believes that two young teenage girls are hiking through the snow on a cold winter day. The nested belief structure implies that William holds the belief about the girls hiking, but it does not necessarily mean that the hypothesis is true. The hypothesis simply states that William believes that two young teenage girls are hiking through the snow on a cold winter day. 

Given the information provided, we cannot definitively conclude that William actually believes in the scenario described in the hypothesis. It is possible that Sophia's belief about William's belief is inaccurate or that William's belief has changed since Sophia's belief was formed. Therefore, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Example

The model wrongly responded "non-entailment" rather than "entailment". The source of confusion appears to be the model's understanding of nested beliefs. In this case, the hypothesis eliminated the nested belief about Charles learning and presented directly what Michael suspects. Even though Charles learning was omitted, the remaining part of the hypothesis is still entailed in the premise.

The prompt urged the model to consider the importance of nested beliefs, which led it to over-emphasize the importance of Charles' knowledge in the premise and, therefore, to produce an incorrect response.

<2> Example

The model wrongly responded with "non-entailment." Here, there is a clear challenge as the model seems to interpret the different subjects (Emma and James) in the premise and hypothesis as an automatic cause for non-entailment. However, the task is concerned with the events depicted rather than who remembers or observes them. The prompt could make clearer that the identification of subjects should not override content analysis.

<3> Example

In this example, the model incorrectly selected "non-entailment." The model misinterpreted the relationship of the nested belief contained in the premise: "Ava thinks that James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall" as separate from the hypothesis: "Ava thinks that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall." The model seemed to have been led astray by the nested structure of the premise and felt the absence of the nested belief makes the hypothesis not entailed. The prompt might have placed too much emphasis on the exact similarity of the beliefs rather than understanding the entailment.

<4> Example

In the fourth example, the model wrongly responded with "non-entailment." The context probably got too complex for the model, and it seems to have misinterpreted the nested belief structure. As in first and third examples, the model seems to overvalue the presence of the exact nested belief in the hypothesis to consider it an entailment. 

Summary of improvements for prompt:

1. The prompt may overemphasize the importance of the structure and presentation of nested beliefs over the core implications of those beliefs. It should highlight that entailment can be found even if a level of the nested belief is missing in the hypothesis.
2. The instructions in the prompt around identifying subjects and their effect on the premise-hypothesis relationship could be confusing for cases where the subjects change, but the overall scenario stays the same. The prompt's focus should also be on the actions, objects or scenarios being described rather than who is observing or recalling them.
3. The prompt could stress more on the importance of comparing the core events depicted in both the premise and the hypothesis, rather than considering individual elements on their own.
4. The emphasis on not rushing may give an unnecessarily prolonged approach to the task. Instead, the model can be prompted to be more decisive based on the main correlation between the premise and hypothesis.
5. It should be clarified that speculation in the premise can validate a hypothesis if the hypothesis is a component of that speculation. This will address problems highlighted in examples like the first and third.

The model misinterpreted the relationship of the nested belief contained in the premise: "Ava thinks that James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall" as separate from the hypothesis: "Ava thinks that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall." The model seemed to have been led astray by the nested structure of the premise and felt the absence of the nested belief makes the hypothesis not entailed. The prompt might have placed too much emphasis on the exact similarity of the beliefs rather than understanding the entailment.

<4> Example

In the fourth example, the model wrongly responded with "non-entailment." The context probably got too complex for the model, and it seems to have misinterpreted the nested belief structure. As in first and third examples, the model seems to overvalue the presence of the exact nested belief in the hypothesis to consider it an entailment. 

Summary of improvements for prompt:

1. The prompt may overemphasize the importance of the structure and presentation of nested beliefs over the core implications of those beliefs. It should highlight that entailment can be found even if a level of the nested belief is missing in the hypothesis.
2. The instructions in the prompt around identifying subjects and their effect on the premise-hypothesis relationship could be confusing for cases where the subjects change, but the overall scenario stays the same. The prompt's focus should also be on the actions, objects or scenarios being described rather than who is observing or recalling them.
3. The prompt could stress more on the importance of comparing the core events depicted in both the premise and the hypothesis, rather than considering individual elements on their own.
4. The emphasis on not rushing may give an unnecessarily prolonged approach to the task. Instead, the model can be prompted to be more decisive based on the main correlation between the premise and hypothesis.
5. It should be clarified that speculation in the premise can validate a hypothesis if the hypothesis is a component of that speculation. This will address problems highlighted in examples like the first and third.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. When you are ready, choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and explain your reasoning process for choosing the answer. Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis.

Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William recognizes that a man and woman stand in front of a white building and look at their hands. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a man and woman look at their hands in front of a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise describes William recognizing a specific situation where a man and woman are standing in front of a white building and looking at their hands. The hypothesis, on the other hand, mentions Charles recognizing a similar situation where a man and woman are looking at their hands in front of a building without specifying the color.

Analyzing the subjects, verbs, and objects in both the premise and hypothesis, we can see that the actions and entities described in the hypothesis are a subset of those in the premise. Charles recognizing a man and woman looking at their hands in front of a building is a more general statement compared to William recognizing the same situation with additional details about the white building.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the premise entails the hypothesis because the specific scenario described in the premise is a more detailed version of the general scenario mentioned in the hypothesis.

Therefore, the answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard thinks that Amelia understands that a group of young men in a gym take turns scoring in basketball. Hypothesis: Amelia understands that a group of young men in a gym take turns scoring in basketball.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Richard thinks that Amelia understands that a group of young men in a gym take turns scoring in basketball. This implies that Richard believes Amelia has comprehension of the situation described.

The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that Amelia understands that a group of young men in a gym take turns scoring in basketball. This aligns with what Richard believes about Amelia's understanding.

Therefore, based on the information provided, the premise entails the hypothesis because Richard's belief about Amelia's understanding directly matches the content of the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building. Hypothesis: Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall that is filled with drawings in a building.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Richard assumes that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall filled with drawings in a building. The hypothesis, on the other hand, directly states that Abigail thinks that a group of people stares at a wall filled with drawings in a building.

Analyzing the subjects, verbs, and objects in both the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that the subject in both cases is Abigail, the verb is "thinks", and the object is "a group of people stares at a wall filled with drawings in a building." The premise introduces Richard's assumption about Abigail's thoughts, while the hypothesis directly states Abigail's thoughts.

Considering the context and the information provided, the premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis. Richard's assumption about Abigail's thoughts does not guarantee that Abigail actually thinks the same way. It is possible that Abigail's actual thoughts differ from what Richard assumes.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Premise: Amelia thinks that Thomas suspects that a man wearing no shirt is lifting a shovel by a wheelbarrow as he works outside. Hypothesis: Amelia thinks that a man wearing no shirt is lifting a shovel by a wheelbarrow as he works outside.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In this scenario, the premise states that Amelia thinks that Thomas suspects a man wearing no shirt is lifting a shovel by a wheelbarrow as he works outside. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simplifies this by stating that Amelia thinks a man wearing no shirt is lifting a shovel by a wheelbarrow as he works outside.

Analyzing the subjects, verbs, and objects in both the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that the hypothesis is a subset of the premise. The premise includes an additional layer of complexity with Thomas suspecting the man's actions, which is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis. However, since Amelia's belief is the focus of both statements, the hypothesis is encompassed within the premise.

Therefore, there is an entailment relationship between the premise and the hypothesis because the hypothesis is a part of the information presented in the premise.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the premise, the subject "Thomas" is observing two boys, one in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another in a blue shirt with penguins. The context implies that Thomas is aware of the specific details of the boys' appearances and surroundings. However, there is no mention of the location being a classroom or the boys sitting at desks.

In the hypothesis, it is stated that Thomas recognizes two boys sitting in a classroom at their desks. This scenario is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. The premise describes the boys' appearances and surroundings but does not provide information about their seating arrangement in a classroom.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no direct entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Thomas recognizes two boys sitting in a classroom at their desks.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1. The model's error: 
In this case, the model identified the situation wrong. It concluded that the premise and hypothesis could be the same just because they described similar situations. However, the model missed the important factor of the observer. In the premise, it is William who recognizes the situation, while in the hypothesis, it is Charles. The subjects - William and Charles, are different persons potentially observing different scenarios, which leads to non-entailment. This indicates the model may have not adequately considered the importance of the observer's subjectivity in assessing the situation.

2. The model's error: 
In this case, the model could not distinguish between the assumption of someone (Richard) and the actual understanding of another person (Amelia). The premise indicates Richard's belief or understanding of Amelia's knowledge, but does not provide any direct evidence that Amelia does, in fact, perceive the situation the same way Richard believes she does. The model could not identify this discrepancy, which again highlights potential improvement in considering observer perspective and subjective beliefs while assessing entailment or non-entailment.

3. The model's error:
Similar to the second case, the model could not differentiate between the inherent subjectivity in 'Richard assumes' in the premise and the objective scenario described in the hypothesis. An assumption does not provide factual information about Abigail's thoughts. Though the situations described in both the premise and the hypothesis are structurally similar, the difference of assuming and actual thinking made for a difference in meaning which the model missed.

4. The model's error:
As in the previous examples, the model failed to distinguish between the belief of one person (Amelia) about another person's (Thomas) suspicions and Amelia's direct thought process. This again suggests a weakness in the model's ability to understand the nuanced character of the subjective relationship between subjects and their thoughts or perceptions.

5. The model's error:
The model failed to take into account the lack of information in the premise about the described actions taking place in a classroom. This presumes that the model was not able to make an accurate distinction between the specific details given in the premise and the general situation described in the hypothesis. The absence of the classroom context makes the premise and hypothesis non-entailing, which the model failed to recognize.

Conclusion:
To improve the prompt, the model's attention needs to be directed more effectively at dealing with subjective elements in ontology - recognition of beliefs, assumptions, thought processes, and their translation into the hypothesis. The model needs to put more focus on scrutinizing specifics like change in observers, assumptions vs. direct knowledge, and nuanced alterations in the contexts. It could also benefit from being reminded to not assume details not provided in the premise when correlating it with the hypothesis. Finally, the model needs to appreciate that similar structures of premise and hypothesis do not necessarily indicate entailment.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Thomas recognizes that a boy in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another boy, wearing a blue shirt with penguins, to his left. Hypothesis: Thomas recognizes that two boys sit in a classroom at their desks.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
In the premise, the subject "Thomas" is observing two boys, one in a green shirt surrounded by toys and another in a blue shirt with penguins. The context implies that Thomas is aware of the specific details of the boys' appearances and surroundings. However, there is no mention of the location being a classroom or the boys sitting at desks.

In the hypothesis, it is stated that Thomas recognizes two boys sitting in a classroom at their desks. This scenario is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. The premise describes the boys' appearances and surroundings but does not provide information about their seating arrangement in a classroom.

Therefore, based on the information provided, there is no direct entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The premise does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that Thomas recognizes two boys sitting in a classroom at their desks.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
1. The model's error: 
In this case, the model identified the situation wrong. It concluded that the premise and hypothesis could be the same just because they described similar situations. However, the model missed the important factor of the observer. In the premise, it is William who recognizes the situation, while in the hypothesis, it is Charles. The subjects - William and Charles, are different persons potentially observing different scenarios, which leads to non-entailment. This indicates the model may have not adequately considered the importance of the observer's subjectivity in assessing the situation.

2. The model's error: 
In this case, the model could not distinguish between the assumption of someone (Richard) and the actual understanding of another person (Amelia). The premise indicates Richard's belief or understanding of Amelia's knowledge, but does not provide any direct evidence that Amelia does, in fact, perceive the situation the same way Richard believes she does. The model could not identify this discrepancy, which again highlights potential improvement in considering observer perspective and subjective beliefs while assessing entailment or non-entailment.

3. The model's error:
Similar to the second case, the model could not differentiate between the inherent subjectivity in 'Richard assumes' in the premise and the objective scenario described in the hypothesis. An assumption does not provide factual information about Abigail's thoughts. Though the situations described in both the premise and the hypothesis are structurally similar, the difference of assuming and actual thinking made for a difference in meaning which the model missed.

4. The model's error:
As in the previous examples, the model failed to distinguish between the belief of one person (Amelia) about another person's (Thomas) suspicions and Amelia's direct thought process. This again suggests a weakness in the model's ability to understand the nuanced character of the subjective relationship between subjects and their thoughts or perceptions.

5. The model's error:
The model failed to take into account the lack of information in the premise about the described actions taking place in a classroom. This presumes that the model was not able to make an accurate distinction between the specific details given in the premise and the general situation described in the hypothesis. The absence of the classroom context makes the premise and hypothesis non-entailing, which the model failed to recognize.

Conclusion:
To improve the prompt, the model's attention needs to be directed more effectively at dealing with subjective elements in ontology - recognition of beliefs, assumptions, thought processes, and their translation into the hypothesis. The model needs to put more focus on scrutinizing specifics like change in observers, assumptions vs. direct knowledge, and nuanced alterations in the contexts. It could also benefit from being reminded to not assume details not provided in the premise when correlating it with the hypothesis. Finally, the model needs to appreciate that similar structures of premise and hypothesis do not necessarily indicate entailment.

Premise: Michael suspects that Charles learns that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction. Hypothesis: Michael suspects that eight tourists stand at a railing looking at an attraction.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Michael suspects that Charles learns about the situation of eight tourists standing at a railing looking at an attraction. The hypothesis, on the other hand, simply states that Michael suspects that eight tourists are standing at a railing looking at an attraction. The premise does not necessarily entail the hypothesis because Michael's suspicion about Charles learning about the situation does not directly imply that there are indeed eight tourists at the railing. Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is non-entailment.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> Wrong Example Analysis: 
Despite the prompt's suggestion to examine the distinctness of observers, the model seems to misinterpret the relationship of the observers in this scenario. It fails to consider that the observer 'William' thinks in both the premise and the hypothesis and doesn't discern between the belief of William and the knowledge of Michael. The model erroneously focuses on the inclusion of Michael's knowledge as an additional layer of complexity in the premise but doesn't entail the hypothesis. However, what the premise is essentially stating is that William thinks that a woman in apron is looking for bread, which directly matches the hypothesis and therefore it entails.

<2> Wrong Example Analysis: 
The model does not match Michael's suspicion in premise and hypothesis. It does not realize that in both the premise and hypothesis, Michael's suspicion is about tourists at a railing looking at attractions. The wrong interpretation can be attributed to the prompt's instruction in understanding that a subjective premise does not always entail the hypothesis. This seems to have misled the model into assuming that Michael's suspicion about Charles learning of the situation doesn't qualify as direct entailment.

Improvement Aspects:
1. Make it explicitly clear that if the key entities (observer, thought, subjects) remain same in the premise and hypothesis, they entail each other, even if there are additional layers of knowledge/understanding/observers.
2. Guide the model to accurately interpret subjective premises, particularly when the main observer's belief or perception directly matches the hypothesis. Sometimes an additional observer's knowledge may not impact the entailment.
3. The model needs to better handle prompting scenarios with multi-layered beliefs or multi-faceted situations. Enhance the prompt to have more emphasis on the consistency of the core observer and the subject of their thought or suspicion.
4. Direct the model to lean more towards stricter matching between the premise and the hypothesis instead of relying too heavily on implied meanings or assumptions.
5. Instructs the model to make careful interpretation of subjective mental states (like suspect, think, know) and their implications on entailment judgement.
6. Strengthen the instruction that the order of the subjects does not necessarily impact entailment if the subjects and their states remain the same.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles recognizes that a tennis player in blue shorts and a white shirt making an aggressive backhand swing towards the tennis ball. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not entail the hypothesis because recognizing a tennis player making a backhand swing does not necessarily mean recognizing that a person is holding a tennis racket. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.

Example 1:

Question: Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Premise: Charles recognizes that a tennis player in blue shorts and a white shirt making an aggressive backhand swing towards the tennis ball. Hypothesis: Charles recognizes that a person is holding a tennis racket. Options: (A) entailment (B) non-entailment

Wrong Answer: The premise does not entail the hypothesis because recognizing a tennis player making a backhand swing does not necessarily mean recognizing that a person is holding a tennis racket. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is (B) non-entailment. 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

Correct Answer: A

Identified Problems:

1. Not Properly Considers Premises: The model fails to take into account that in order for Charles to recognize a tennis player making an aggressive backhand swing, the person must be holding a tennis racket. A tennis racket is implied in the act of a backhand swing at a tennis ball. 

2. Misinterpreting Contextual Information: The model appeared to be focusing on minute details and failing to grasp the broader scenario. In this case, recognizing a person as a tennis player in the middle of a swing inherently means they are holding a tennis racket, even though it's not explicitly stated.

3. Unseen or Unsaid Details: The model seemed to contradict the instruction to "always avoid inferring unseen or unsaid details in the premise." In reality, it should infer some unseen details that are implicit from the given scenario. 

Improvements for the Prompt:

The prompt can be improved by taking the following aspects into consideration:

1. Add Instructions to Acknowledge Implicit Information: Include explicit guidance to acknowledge implicit information that is logically connected due to the actions or events described in the premises.

2. Clarify the Meaning of Inferring Unseen Details: The prompt should make it clear that though unseen or unsaid details should be avoided, it is critical to recognize actions that are contextually or logically implicit in the premise.

3. Direct the Model to Evaluate Common Knowledge: The prompt should guide the model to take into consideration common knowledge or logically deduced information in its analysis.

4. Encourage Balancing Between Details and Broader Context: Clearly state that the model should not just focus on examining minute details but also understand the broader scenario or context.

Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example <1> Reasoning:
The language model wrongly asserts that there might have been miscommunication or misunderstanding between Olivia and Charles, forming a disconnect between the premise and the hypothesis. However, the task doesn't call for interpretation of potential miscommunications or misunderstandings. The basis of the task is grounded on the logic within the phraseology itself.

Example <2> Reasoning:
In this case, the AI model applies subjective speculation about a potential misunderstanding or miscommunication between Joseph and John which is not suggested in the premise or hypothesis. The task here does not call for such speculative context. 

Example <3> Reasoning:
This is another case where the model is adding an extra layer of context by speculating about the truth value of David's suspicion, which is not called for in the premise or hypothesis.

Aspects to improve in the prompt:
1. The Accuracy of Instructions: The prompt instructs the model to speculate on potential concerns that aren't present in the premise and hypothesis like misunderstandings or credibility of beliefs. This leads to the wrong conclusion in the model's answers. The instructions need to instill a focus on the stated premise and hypothesis without speculation.
   
2. Inferring Unseen Details: The prompt warns against inferring unseen details, and yet that is what the model ends up doing. The prompt should put more stress on this aspect of the task.
   
3. Linguistic Ambiguity: The prompt should dictate to the model that the task involves interpreting the logic of a content rather than exploring its linguistic uncertainties or ambiguities.
   
4. Objectivity: The prompt should emphasize discerning the factual relationship within the given context without the model's subjective interpretation or assumptions. 

5. Context Evaluation: The context should be taken from the scenario directly, as inferred by the words in the premise and the hypothesis. The prompt should restrict the model from adding or presuming any external context.

This leads to the wrong conclusion in the model's answers. The instructions need to instill a focus on the stated premise and hypothesis without speculation.
   
2. Inferring Unseen Details: The prompt warns against inferring unseen details, and yet that is what the model ends up doing. The prompt should put more stress on this aspect of the task.
   
3. Linguistic Ambiguity: The prompt should dictate to the model that the task involves interpreting the logic of a content rather than exploring its linguistic uncertainties or ambiguities.
   
4. Objectivity: The prompt should emphasize discerning the factual relationship within the given context without the model's subjective interpretation or assumptions. 

5. Context Evaluation: The context should be taken from the scenario directly, as inferred by the words in the premise and the hypothesis. The prompt should restrict the model from adding or presuming any external context.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. When you are ready, choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and explain your reasoning process for choosing the answer. Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Evaluate the premises and hypotheses, focusing on understanding the context and the relation between them. Examine the subjects, verbs, and objects involved, giving additional weight to the order of subjects. Consider the beliefs, assumptions, thinking processes involved and interpret the meaning of the scenario when it pertains to layered beliefs or multifaceted situations. Understand that a subjective premise does not always entail the hypothesis. Remember to examine the distinctness of observers if any, and discern between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Always avoid inferring unseen or unsaid details in the premise. Examine the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis minutely to determine causality. Study whether the premise entails the hypothesis or otherwise. Don't rush but methodically consider each aspect involved in the scenario. Choose from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and elucidate your reasoning behind your choice. Finalize your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail recognizes that the red motocross bike and its rider are airborne above the trees. Hypothesis: Abigail recognizes that a rider is riding his motocross bike.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Abigail recognizes the red motocross bike and its rider are airborne above the trees. The hypothesis suggests that Abigail recognizes a rider is riding his motocross bike. While the premise includes the specific details of the red motocross bike and its rider being airborne, it does not explicitly mention Abigail recognizing the rider riding the bike. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is: (B) non-entailment

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Abigail suspects that Amelia sees that a man is steering his ship out at sea. Hypothesis: Amelia sees that a man is steering his ship out at sea.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer> 

The premise explicitly states that Abigail suspects that Amelia sees a man steering his ship out at sea. If Abigail suspects this, it implies that Amelia is indeed seeing the man steering his ship. Therefore, the premise directly leads to the hypothesis, making it an entailment.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For Example <1>: 

The question provided a premise where "Abigail recognizes the red motocross bike and its rider are airborne above the trees." The hypothesis suggested, "Abigail recognizes that a rider is riding his motocross bike." The model incorrectly assessed the connection between the premise and the hypothesis as non-entailment(B). 

The model's mistake can be attributed to misunderstanding the context of the situation. In reality, if Abigail recognizes a rider being airborne on a motorcycle, it is implicit that the rider must have been riding the bike to become airborne. Therefore, even though it doesn't explicitly state that Abigail recognizes the rider "riding" the bike, it can be inferred from the provided text, leading to the conclusion of the entailment.

For Example <2>: 

In this question, the prompt was "Abigail suspects that Amelia sees that a man is steering his ship out at sea," and the hypothesis was "Amelia sees that a man is steering his ship out at sea". The model claimed this is an issue of entailment(A), however, the correct label is non-entailment(B).

The model likely made this mistake due to misunderstanding the nuance between "suspects" and "knows" - just because Abigail suspects something does not mean that it's true. Therefore, the premise doesn't entail the hypothesis. The model failed to recognize this subtlety in language.

In conclusion, the current prompt seems to struggle with subtleties of language, making inferences from text, and understanding the implicit meanings of sentences. These are the aspects that can improve the prompt:

1. The prompt should clarify that while the model shouldn't introduce outside assumptions or beliefs, it is necessary to understand the implicitness of certain phrases or situations in the text.
2. Adjusting the prompt to emphasize the importance of understanding the nuanced differences between words.
3. The model needs to be guided to understand that certain actions can be understood as a sequence. So if one action is stated, corresponding previous actions can be inferred in some cases.
4. A provision could be added to the prompt asking the model to distinguish between suspicion and certainty, as in Example <2>.

The model's input is:
Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information. Use the subjects, verbs, and objects to help understand the context, and identify the connection between the premises and hypotheses. Do not introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. Pay close attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, and avoid making speculations about hidden meanings or additional contexts. The task here is to determine if the content of the premise directly leads to the content of the hypothesis. Consequently, a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily need to affirm the hypothesis. Take your time, consider each component of the situation provided, and avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. Select 'entailment' if you find that the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case. Explain your reasoning behind your choice. Finally, confirm your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava believes that Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. Hypothesis: Olivia thinks that the dog is in the snow in front of some trees.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The premise explicitly states that Ava believes Olivia thinks the dog is in the snow in front of some trees. This implies that Olivia indeed thinks the dog is in the snow in front of some trees, leading to the hypothesis being a direct result of the premise.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

The model's input is:
Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball. Hypothesis: Evelyn assumes that children play in the snow.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis. Just because Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow and one of them is making a snowball, it does not mean that she assumes children play in the snow in general. Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is non-entailment.
<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: James understands that William suspects that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts. Hypothesis: William suspects that James understands that a blond woman sits on a park bench while wearing a brown tank top and olive green shorts.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that James understands that William suspects a specific scenario involving a blond woman sitting on a park bench while wearing specific clothing. The hypothesis suggests that William suspects that James understands the same scenario. Since the premise explicitly mentions that James understands what William suspects, it logically follows that William suspects that James understands the scenario as well. Therefore, there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Reason for the wrong answer:
The model made an invalid assumption in this example. Even though the premise says that Ava believes that Olivia thinks the dog is in the snow, it doesn't directly affirm that Olivia does think so. The belief lies in Ava's mind, not Olivia's. The model incorrectly made an inference based on this premise.

<2>
Reason for the wrong answer:
Here, the model used an incorrect interpretation of the statement. The premise states that Evelyn assumes that there are children playing in the snow, and from it, the model should have inferred that Evelyn assumes children play in the snow in general. However, the model failed to draw the broader implication from the specific instance.

<3>
Reason for the wrong answer:
The model made a false assumption in this case. The premise only states James understands William's suspicion. But the hypothesis reverses the roles. It doesn't directly follow that because James understands William's suspicion, William should suspect that James understands. The concept of understanding is from James' perspective not William's.

Aspects to improve the prompt:

1. Clarify the instruction about the relationship between someone's beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge and the actual situation. 
2. Emphasize that the model must not make additional assumptions not evident in the text.
3. Specify that understanding or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily reciprocate. If person A understands person B, it does not automatically mean that person B understands that person A understands them.
4. Underline that a premise involving a specific instance doesn't necessarily confirm or deny a broader or general hypothesis. The model should be able to identify the general concept from the specific context. 
5. Urge the language model to more strictly adhere to ‘non-entailment’ if the content of the premise does not necessarily and directly lead to the content of the hypothesis. Only an obvious and direct link should lead to ‘entailment’.
6. Add guidelines to differentiate between individual perspectives and independent facts.
7. Highlight the importance of the proper analysis of verbs and their subjects in the context. The model should identify the subjects to whom the verbs (like think, understand, suspect) apply and base its analysis on these interactions.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. When you are ready, choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and explain your reasoning process for choosing the answer. Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Evaluate the premises and hypotheses, focusing on understanding the context and the relation between them. Examine the subjects, verbs, and objects involved, giving additional weight to the order of subjects. Consider the beliefs, assumptions, thinking processes involved and interpret the meaning of the scenario when it pertains to layered beliefs or multifaceted situations. Understand that a subjective premise does not always entail the hypothesis. Remember to examine the distinctness of observers if any, and discern between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Always avoid inferring unseen or unsaid details in the premise. Examine the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis minutely to determine causality. Study whether the premise entails the hypothesis or otherwise. Don't rush but methodically consider each aspect involved in the scenario. Choose from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and elucidate your reasoning behind your choice. Finalize your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information. Use the subjects, verbs, and objects to help understand the context, and identify the connection between the premises and hypotheses. Do not introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. Pay close attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, and avoid making speculations about hidden meanings or additional contexts. The task here is to determine if the content of the premise directly leads to the content of the hypothesis. Consequently, a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily need to affirm the hypothesis. Take your time, consider each component of the situation provided, and avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. Select 'entailment' if you find that the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case. Explain your reasoning behind your choice. Finally, confirm your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles assumes that two women are tending to their herd of animals including cows and goats near a building made primarily of stone. Hypothesis: Charles assumes that the two women are taking care of a herd of animals.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles assumes two women are tending to their herd of animals, including cows and goats, near a building made primarily of stone. The hypothesis is that Charles assumes the two women are taking care of a herd of animals. The premise does not explicitly mention that the women are taking care of the animals, only that they are near a building made of stone. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is: 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Premise: William suspects that a woman player in white and black, sends the volleyball over the net, while the opposing team in navy blue, tries to block it, as the coach and a few spectators watch, in a gym. Hypothesis: Taylor suspects that they are in a gym.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise explicitly states that the scene is taking place in a gym, which directly leads to the hypothesis that Taylor suspects they are in a gym. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1:
<1> 
In this example, the model misunderstood the context outlined in the premise and made a wrong inference. The premise explicitly states that Charles assumes two women are tending to their herd of animals, which builds a direct link to the hypothesis that the two women are taking care of a herd of animals. The model, however, focused on the location – near a building made of stone – and determined that the premise does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis.

Wrong Example 2:
<2> 
In this instance, the model made an incorrect assumption based on the premise. It failed to consider the difference between 'William' in the premise and 'Taylor' in the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information about what 'Taylor' suspects, only 'William'. The mistake came from not adhering to the instruction to avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
1. Clarity on Subject Matter: The prompt should be more explicit about the subjects, objects, and verbs mentioned in the premise and hypothesis, stressing that they need to align for the result to be an 'entailment'. 
2. Addressing Mismatches: The prompt should emphasize the importance of addressing any mismatches or discrepancies between the premise and hypothesis, which could imply 'non-entailment'. 
3. No Inference: Reinforce the instruction not to introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. 
4. Importance of Precise Detailing: The prompt should stress on preciseness and detail orientation while analyzing the premise and hypothesis. No part of the information should be ignored or overlooked.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information. Use the subjects, verbs, and objects to help understand the context, and identify the connection between the premises and hypotheses. Do not introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. Pay close attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, and avoid making speculations about hidden meanings or additional contexts. The task here is to determine if the content of the premise directly leads to the content of the hypothesis. Consequently, a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily need to affirm the hypothesis. Take your time, consider each component of the situation provided, and avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. Select 'entailment' if you find that the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case. Explain your reasoning behind your choice. Finally, confirm your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information. Use the subjects, verbs, and objects to help understand the context, and identify the connection between the premises and hypotheses. Do not introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. Pay close attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, and avoid making speculations about hidden meanings or additional contexts. The task here is to determine if the content of the premise directly leads to the content of the hypothesis. Consequently, a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily need to affirm the hypothesis. Take your time, consider each component of the situation provided, and avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. Select 'entailment' if you find that the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case. Explain your reasoning behind your choice. Finally, confirm your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Charles assumes that two women are tending to their herd of animals including cows and goats near a building made primarily of stone. Hypothesis: Charles assumes that the two women are taking care of a herd of animals.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Charles assumes two women are tending to their herd of animals, including cows and goats, near a building made primarily of stone. The hypothesis is that Charles assumes the two women are taking care of a herd of animals. The premise does not explicitly mention that the women are taking care of the animals, only that they are near a building made of stone. Therefore, the premise does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is: 

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

<2> 
The model's input is:
Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information. Use the subjects, verbs, and objects to help understand the context, and identify the connection between the premises and hypotheses. Do not introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. Pay close attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, and avoid making speculations about hidden meanings or additional contexts.

Consequently, a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily need to affirm the hypothesis. Take your time, consider each component of the situation provided, and avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. Select 'entailment' if you find that the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case. Explain your reasoning behind your choice. Finally, confirm your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: William suspects that a woman player in white and black, sends the volleyball over the net, while the opposing team in navy blue, tries to block it, as the coach and a few spectators watch, in a gym. Hypothesis: Taylor suspects that they are in a gym.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise does entail the hypothesis. The premise explicitly states that the scene is taking place in a gym, which directly leads to the hypothesis that Taylor suspects they are in a gym. Therefore, the correct answer is:

<answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
Wrong Example 1:
<1> 
In this example, the model misunderstood the context outlined in the premise and made a wrong inference. The premise explicitly states that Charles assumes two women are tending to their herd of animals, which builds a direct link to the hypothesis that the two women are taking care of a herd of animals. The model, however, focused on the location – near a building made of stone – and determined that the premise does not necessarily lead to the hypothesis.

Wrong Example 2:
<2> 
In this instance, the model made an incorrect assumption based on the premise. It failed to consider the difference between 'William' in the premise and 'Taylor' in the hypothesis. The premise does not provide any information about what 'Taylor' suspects, only 'William'. The mistake came from not adhering to the instruction to avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. 

Prompt Improvement Suggestions:
1. Clarity on Subject Matter: The prompt should be more explicit about the subjects, objects, and verbs mentioned in the premise and hypothesis, stressing that they need to align for the result to be an 'entailment'. 
2. Addressing Mismatches: The prompt should emphasize the importance of addressing any mismatches or discrepancies between the premise and hypothesis, which could imply 'non-entailment'. 
3. No Inference: Reinforce the instruction not to introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. 
4. Importance of Precise Detailing: The prompt should stress on preciseness and detail orientation while analyzing the premise and hypothesis. No part of the information should be ignored or overlooked.
5. Characters in Context: If the premise and hypothesis involve characters, it should require the model to ensure that the identities coincide in both. If not, that should typically indicate 'non-entailment'. 
6. Reinforce Causality: The prompt should emphasize more on checking the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. When you are ready, choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and explain your reasoning process for choosing the answer. Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Evaluate the premises and hypotheses, focusing on understanding the context and the relation between them. Examine the subjects, verbs, and objects involved, giving additional weight to the order of subjects. Consider the beliefs, assumptions, thinking processes involved and interpret the meaning of the scenario when it pertains to layered beliefs or multifaceted situations. Understand that a subjective premise does not always entail the hypothesis. Remember to examine the distinctness of observers if any, and discern between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Always avoid inferring unseen or unsaid details in the premise. Examine the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis minutely to determine causality. Study whether the premise entails the hypothesis or otherwise. Don't rush but methodically consider each aspect involved in the scenario. Choose from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and elucidate your reasoning behind your choice. Finalize your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Analyze the premises and hypotheses by adhering strictly to the provided textual information. Use the subjects, verbs, and objects to help understand the context, and identify the connection between the premises and hypotheses. Do not introduce outside assumptions or beliefs not evident in the text. Pay close attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, and avoid making speculations about hidden meanings or additional contexts. The task here is to determine if the content of the premise directly leads to the content of the hypothesis. Consequently, a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not necessarily need to affirm the hypothesis. Take your time, consider each component of the situation provided, and avoid making inferences about anything beyond what is explicitly stated. Select 'entailment' if you find that the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case. Explain your reasoning behind your choice. Finally, confirm your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Olivia knows that people checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. Hypothesis: Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Olivia knows that people are checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city. This does not necessarily mean that Olivia knows whether a specific car door has been shut or not. Just because Olivia is aware of people looking at a car with all its doors open does not automatically imply that she knows the status of each individual door. Therefore, the hypothesis that Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut is not entailed by the premise.

<answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Ava thinks that James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall. Hypothesis: Ava thinks that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Ava thinks James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall. This implies that Ava is aware of the situation involving the blue kayak and the small waterfall. However, the hypothesis simply states that Ava thinks the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall, without mentioning James' knowledge. Therefore, the hypothesis does not necessarily follow from the premise as it does not explicitly state that Ava knows about the blue kayak being ridden over the small waterfall, only that she thinks James knows. 

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: B.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Example 1: 
The model misinterprets the premise and assumes it doesn't necessarily entail that Olivia knows a car door is open. However, the prompt “Olivia knows that people are checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city” clearly states that all doors of the car are open. That information, directly conveyed in the premise, absolutely entails the hypothesis “Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.” Therefore, the model's analysis was incorrect because it didn't accurately identify and take into account the explicit information given in the premise. The prompt might need to emphasize the importance of identifying clear relationships between premises and hypotheses and not over-complicating the direct entailment which is evident from the given facts.

Example 2: 
The model gets confused when extra entities are added in the premise. While the premise says that "Ava thinks that James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall", this inherently means that Ava is aware of the situation about the blue kayak and the waterfall. Ava cannot think that James knows something without her being aware of that thing herself. The model over-complicates the premise and fails to see this implicit connection. The prompt might need to be more explicit in guiding the analysis to identify such indirect, yet clear, inference.

Improvement-1: The prompt can stress more on the distinction between implicit and explicit information. It should guide the analysis to identify entailments even when they are not directly expressed, but are evident from the premise.

Improvement-2: The prompt should emphasize that information inherent in the premise should be moved to the hypothesis even if not explicitly mentioned.

Improvement-3: The prompt might need to caution against over-complicating the situation when a simple logical analysis of the given scenario can provide the entailed answers.

Improvement-4: The prompt can highlight that if a premise states someone knows something, it is inherently granted that the person is aware of that thing, even if it's not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, the model should not get confused by additional entities in the premise.

However, the prompt “Olivia knows that people are checking out a car with all its doors open in a parking lot in the city” clearly states that all doors of the car are open. That information, directly conveyed in the premise, absolutely entails the hypothesis “Olivia knows that a car door has not been shut.” Therefore, the model's analysis was incorrect because it didn't accurately identify and take into account the explicit information given in the premise. The prompt might need to emphasize the importance of identifying clear relationships between premises and hypotheses and not over-complicating the direct entailment which is evident from the given facts.

Example 2: 
The model gets confused when extra entities are added in the premise. While the premise says that "Ava thinks that James knows that the blue kayak is being ridden over a small waterfall", this inherently means that Ava is aware of the situation about the blue kayak and the waterfall. Ava cannot think that James knows something without her being aware of that thing herself. The model over-complicates the premise and fails to see this implicit connection. The prompt might need to be more explicit in guiding the analysis to identify such indirect, yet clear, inference.

Improvement-1: The prompt can stress more on the distinction between implicit and explicit information. It should guide the analysis to identify entailments even when they are not directly expressed, but are evident from the premise.

Improvement-2: The prompt should emphasize that information inherent in the premise should be moved to the hypothesis even if not explicitly mentioned.

Improvement-3: The prompt might need to caution against over-complicating the situation when a simple logical analysis of the given scenario can provide the entailed answers.

Improvement-4: The prompt can highlight that if a premise states someone knows something, it is inherently granted that the person is aware of that thing, even if it's not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis. Therefore, the model should not get confused by additional entities in the premise.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. When you are ready, choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and explain your reasoning process for choosing the answer. Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Evaluate the premises and hypotheses, focusing on understanding the context and the relation between them. Examine the subjects, verbs, and objects involved, giving additional weight to the order of subjects. Consider the beliefs, assumptions, thinking processes involved and interpret the meaning of the scenario when it pertains to layered beliefs or multifaceted situations. Understand that a subjective premise does not always entail the hypothesis. Remember to examine the distinctness of observers if any, and discern between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Always avoid inferring unseen or unsaid details in the premise. Examine the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis minutely to determine causality. Study whether the premise entails the hypothesis or otherwise. Don't rush but methodically consider each aspect involved in the scenario. Choose from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and elucidate your reasoning behind your choice. Finalize your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.
(4) Critically assess the premises and hypotheses by contextualizing them and recognizing their inherent relationships. Scrutinize the subjects, verbs, and objects, prioritizing the order of subjects. Take into consideration the beliefs, assumptions, and reasoning processes involved, particularly in complex or layered situations. Remember that a subjective premise does not automatically lead to the hypothesis. To avoid misinterpretation, recognize the observer's viewpoint, if mentioned, and distinguish between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Refrain from adding details not mentioned in the premise, but do recognize implicit connections that are a natural result of events or actions described. Meticulously investigate the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to establish causality. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, considering common knowledge, logical deductions, and the broader context. Pace yourself and thoroughly contemplate each aspect embedded in the scenario. After your evaluation, pick between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on your analysis. Elaborate the reasons behind your choice. To finalize, encapsulate your choice between <answer> and </answer>, ensuring that your deductions balance between detailed analysis and a comprehensive understanding of the scenario.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Joseph knows that Michael assumes that a man is using what looks to be a fax machine. Hypothesis: Michael assumes that Joseph knows that a man is using what looks to be a fax machine.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that Joseph knows that Michael assumes a man is using what looks to be a fax machine. This implies that Joseph is aware of Michael's assumption. However, the hypothesis suggests that Michael assumes Joseph knows about the man using the fax machine. There is no direct indication in the premise that Michael assumes Joseph knows about the fax machine, only that Joseph knows about Michael's assumption. Therefore, the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
For the example given, the model responded incorrectly likely due to several reasons:

1. The Complexity of the Scenario: The premises and hypotheses in the question are quite complex and involve multiple layers of assumptions and knowledge. It might be harder for the model to understand and interpret the complex relationships and assumptions involved in such cases.

2. Faulty Inference: The model seems to have inferred incorrectly. It acknowledges that "the the hypothesis goes beyond the information provided in the premise", but misclassifies the relationship as entailment. This shows that the model didn't understand that entailment means the hypothesis could be concluded solely from the premise. 

3. Subject and Object Identification: It's possible the model may have had trouble tracking the subjects and objects in the sentence given the complex, nested structure, leading to incorrect interpretation and response.

These findings suggest several areas of potential improvement for the prompt:

1. Greater Clarity in Instructions: The current prompt is quite dense and might be overwhelming for the model. It could be made simpler and clearer, ensuring it understands the basis of entailment.

2. Emphasize Clear Interpretation of Complex Scenarios: The prompt should highlight the importance of accurately understanding complex relationships, multiple assumptions, and the process of deducing conclusions.

3. Improve Understanding of Entailment: Training the model around more examples where entailment may not be correct could help it better grasp this concept.

4. Tracking Subjects and Objects: If possible, add an emphasis on correctly identifying and tracking subjects and objects, especially in complex, nested sentences.

Ultimately, the prompt should facilitate a balance between detailed analysis and thorough understanding of complex interactions embedded within the scenario, which would help the model predict the given premises and hypotheses with higher accuracy.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Michael learns that Sophia suspects that two boys, surrounded by paper pieces, hold a third boys shirt to prevent him from grabbing a bag. Hypothesis: Sophia suspects that Michael learns that two boys, surrounded by paper pieces, hold a third boys shirt to prevent him from grabbing a bag.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise describes Michael learning about Sophia's suspicion regarding a situation involving three boys and a bag. The hypothesis restates this information, indicating that Sophia suspects what Michael has learned. 

Given the information provided, there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis. The hypothesis directly follows from the premise as it reflects Sophia's perspective on the situation that Michael has become aware of. 

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(A) entailment</answer>

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.

Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. Hypothesis: Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The premise states that John believes that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse. This implies that John's belief is based on what he thinks Amelia assumes, not necessarily on the actual truth of the situation. Therefore, the premise does not directly state that Amelia actually assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse.

Given this analysis, the hypothesis that Amelia assumes that a young boy in a cowboy hat rides a large horse cannot be definitively concluded from the premise. Amelia's actual assumption may or may not align with John's belief about her assumption.

Therefore, the relation between the premise and the hypothesis is <answer>non-entailment</answer>.

The correct label is: B
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> For the example where the premise is "Michael learns that Sophia suspects that two boys, surrounded by paper pieces, hold a third boy's shirt to prevent him from grabbing a bag," and the hypothesis is "Sophia suspects that Michael learns that two boys, surrounded by paper pieces, hold a third boys shirt to prevent him from grabbing a bag," the model wrongly predicted (A) entailment whereas the correct answer is (B) non-entailment. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the structure and order of subjects in the sentences. The model could have construed the premise and the hypothesis as being similar due to similar sentence structure and words, despite their inherently different meanings.

<2> In the second example as well, the model's conclusion that the premise and the hypothesis entail each other suggests confusion over the order of the belief assertion. The premise suggested John's belief of Amelia's assumption, but the hypothesis stated Amelia's assumption directly.

In both cases, the inherent relationships and context of the statements were probably misinterpreted. There might be a challenge in understanding the layers of belief and assumption between the characters and the actual situation.

Improvement Suggestion: 

1. The model needs to prioritize the order of subjects better to avoid confusion.

2. It should also distinctly distinguish between different levels of belief, assumptions, and the actual situation; it seems to have difficulty distinguishing between someone's belief or assumption of a situation, and the actual situation itself.

3. Further emphasize on understanding the inherent relationships and contexts of situations, as this seems to be a consistent issue. It could be beneficial to suggest the model to break down complex sentences into simpler parts to better discern the relationships and context between different entities.

4. Additional guidance is necessary for the model to avoid adding details not mentioned in the premise, and to distinguish between implicit connections and assumption of facts not clearly spelled out in the information given.

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about causal attribution
(1) Analyze the context and verbs in the premises and hypotheses carefully to identify the relation between them. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Keep in mind that subjectivity or speculative nature in the premise does not automatically affirm the hypothesis. Always cross-verify the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to ensure correlation and causality. When you are ready, choose from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and explain your reasoning process for choosing the answer. Finally, bracket your answer option between <answer> and </answer>.
(2) Carefully analyze the subjects, verbs, and objects in the premises and hypotheses to understand the context and identify the correct relation between them. Pay extra attention to the order of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how it impacts the meaning when it involves nested beliefs or complex compound scenarios. Remember that subjective or speculative content in the premise does not always validate the hypothesis. Correlate and contrast the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to determine causality. Establish whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Do not rush, but consider the implications of each element in the context. Select your choice from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and provide a comprehensive explanation of your reasoning process for selecting the answer. Following your response, place the chosen option between <answer> and </answer>.
(3) Evaluate the premises and hypotheses, focusing on understanding the context and the relation between them. Examine the subjects, verbs, and objects involved, giving additional weight to the order of subjects. Consider the beliefs, assumptions, thinking processes involved and interpret the meaning of the scenario when it pertains to layered beliefs or multifaceted situations. Understand that a subjective premise does not always entail the hypothesis. Remember to examine the distinctness of observers if any, and discern between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Always avoid inferring unseen or unsaid details in the premise. Examine the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis minutely to determine causality. Study whether the premise entails the hypothesis or otherwise. Don't rush but methodically consider each aspect involved in the scenario. Choose from 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and elucidate your reasoning behind your choice. Finalize your answer by placing it between <answer> and </answer>.

3. The new prompt should be wrapped with <START> and <END>.

The new prompts is:
response:
<START> Apply a critical lens to the premises and hypotheses, unpacking them and identifying their inherent relationships. When examining the subjects, verbs, and objects, ensure that the hierarchy of the subjects is maintained. Bear in mind the beliefs, assumptions, and reasoning involved, especially in layered or complex situations. Remain aware that a subjective premise does not directly imply the hypothesis. To foreclose the possibility of misinterpretation, keep an eye out for the observer's viewpoint, if mentioned, and differentiate between an individual's assumptions and what they verifiably know. Forgo the addition of unmentioned details in the premise, but do notice the hidden links emerging naturally from described events or actions. Conduct a painstaking enquiry of the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, aiming to deduce causality. Ascertain whether the premise entails the hypothesis, taking stock of common knowledge, logic-based deductions, and the greater context. Settle into a steady pace and engage with each detail inherent in the scenario. Once your evaluation is complete, choose 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' based on your analysis. Expound on the rationale behind your choice. In your conclusion, embed your decision between <answer> and </answer>, demonstrating a balance between a detailed analysis and a holistic understanding of the scenario. Keep in mind to place greater emphasis on unraveling the true order of subjects and avoid assuming details that are not explicitly stated. In the case of layered beliefs or assumptions, make sure to carefully distinguish each level to get a clear understanding of the actual situation. <END>

   prompt: Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end.

   prompt: For this task, your role is to assess the relationship between the presented premise and the hypothesis. Your options to describe this relationship are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, the hypothesis might include some aspects of the premise, but this doesn't mean that the premise automatically entails the hypothesis. Beware of variations in context, as these can transform original meanings or assumptions - these variations could be changes in the source of the information, the level of the information, or the transition from direct to second-hand information. Be scrupulous in your judgment, considering the flow of information, possible shifts in meaning and the change in assumption levels. It's mandatory to analyze all components of the premise and the hypothesis, paying careful attention to subjects, actions, and objects involved, noting the directness or indirectness of their relationships. It's not only about what is said, but also who says it and the information's distance from the initial source. In the case of second-hand information or subjective beliefs, consider whether they are presented as actual facts. An entailment suggests a direct, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, not swayed by subjective beliefs. Always rationalise your choices and supply a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end, clarifying whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect.

   prompt: For this exercise, you need to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Your task is to determine if this connection is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay special attention to the nature of information in both premise and hypothesis: direct assertions or possible assumptions made by any character about another's belief. Hypotheses may contain elements from the premise but do not automatically prove entailment. Beware of shifts in context such as changes in the messenger, or degree of directness of the information in both premise and hypothesis, since these may alter the original meanings or assumptions. It's equally important to consider the dynamics of second-hand information and its impact. Unpack each premise and each hypothesis, scrutinizing every element, like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Gauge the nature of the relationships - direct or indirect - between these elements, and note that similar content can carry different implications depending on their transmission pathway. Remember to analyze if subjective beliefs or second-hand input are presented as unquestionable truths. A true entailment suggests an unambiguous, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, in which subjective beliefs do not intervene. In every step of your analysis, be meticulous, rationalize your choices carefully, and provide a comprehensive reasoning for your decisions. It is essential to be exact whether the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is straightforward or indirect. Now, evaluate the ensuing premises and hypotheses and decide their linkage, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end. Now, analyze the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the given premises and hypotheses and decide whether there is a valid logical inference from the premise to the hypothesis. Choose 'entailment' if the hypothesis reasonably and necessarily stems from the premise. Otherwise, select 'non-entailment'. It's essential to note that a hypothesis being a subset of the premise does not automatically constitute entailment. Consider the context, source, or level of information, as shifts in these elements can change the original meaning or assumptions. A keen focus should be placed on the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember, second-hand information does not directly imply the beliefs or opinions of the source. Carefully evaluate the implications of the information flow, shifts in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. In your analysis, take into account each part of the premise and the hypothesis, including subjects, actions, and objects, and how the relationships are indirectly or directly portrayed. Factor in not just the information but also the source and how removed the original assumption is from the propagated information. After your analysis, enumerate your reasoning behind your conclusion. Now, determine the relationship between the following premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: Critically assess the premises and hypotheses by contextualizing them and recognizing their inherent relationships. Scrutinize the subjects, verbs, and objects, prioritizing the order of subjects. Take into consideration the beliefs, assumptions, and reasoning processes involved, particularly in complex or layered situations. Remember that a subjective premise does not automatically lead to the hypothesis. To avoid misinterpretation, recognize the observer's viewpoint, if mentioned, and distinguish between an individual's assumptions and their actual knowledge. Refrain from adding details not mentioned in the premise, but do recognize implicit connections that are a natural result of events or actions described. Meticulously investigate the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to establish causality. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, considering common knowledge, logical deductions, and the broader context.

   prompt: Your task is to determine whether the hypothesis logically stems from the premise, choosing the terms 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' to describe this relationship. Note that the hypothesis may be a subset of the premise, but that does not necessitate entailment. Be vigilant of shifts in context, such as changes in the source or level of the information, as these can alter original meanings or assumptions. Similarly, consider the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember to rationalise your judgements, particularly focusing on assessing the information flow, any potential shift in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. When interpreting the premise and the hypothesis, it's crucial and mandatory to consider each component such as subjects, actions, and objects involved, and how indirect or direct their relationships are. It's about not just what is said, but also who says it and how many steps removed the information is from the original source. Provide detailed reasoning for your reasoning and decisions at the end. Now, analyze the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, selecting either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Your task is to analyze the given premises and hypotheses and decide whether there is a valid logical inference from the premise to the hypothesis. Choose 'entailment' if the hypothesis reasonably and necessarily stems from the premise. Otherwise, select 'non-entailment'. It's essential to note that a hypothesis being a subset of the premise does not automatically constitute entailment. Consider the context, source, or level of information, as shifts in these elements can change the original meaning or assumptions. A keen focus should be placed on the propagation and impact of second-hand information. Remember, second-hand information does not directly imply the beliefs or opinions of the source. Carefully evaluate the implications of the information flow, shifts in meaning, or changes in assumption levels. In your analysis, take into account each part of the premise and the hypothesis, including subjects, actions, and objects, and how the relationships are indirectly or directly portrayed. Factor in not just the information but also the source and how removed the original assumption is from the propagated information. After your analysis, enumerate your reasoning behind your conclusion. Now, determine the relationship between the following premises and hypotheses.

   prompt: For this task, your role is to assess the relationship between the presented premise and the hypothesis. Your options to describe this relationship are 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Remember, the hypothesis might include some aspects of the premise, but this doesn't mean that the premise automatically entails the hypothesis. Beware of variations in context, as these can transform original meanings or assumptions - these variations could be changes in the source of the information, the level of the information, or the transition from direct to second-hand information. Be scrupulous in your judgment, considering the flow of information, possible shifts in meaning and the change in assumption levels. It's mandatory to analyze all components of the premise and the hypothesis, paying careful attention to subjects, actions, and objects involved, noting the directness or indirectness of their relationships. It's not only about what is said, but also who says it and the information's distance from the initial source. In the case of second-hand information or subjective beliefs, consider whether they are presented as actual facts. An entailment suggests a direct, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, not swayed by subjective beliefs. Always rationalise your choices and supply a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end, clarifying whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect. Now, analyze the following premises and hypotheses and ascertain their relationship, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: Your task involves evaluating the relationship between a given premise and hypothesis. The nature of this relationship is to be expressed as either 'entailment', where the hypothesis directly follows from the premise, or 'non-entailment', where the hypothesis cannot be inferred directly from the premise. Bear in mind, the hypothesis could encompass some elements of the premise, but this alone doesn't signify entailment. Particularly, you should take into account the subjects, actions, and objects, and understand their relationships. Attention should be paid to potential contextual shifts which may alter the intended meaning. Consider whether the information is first or second-hand and how that influences the directness of the relationship. Importantly, when assessing the connection, consider both literal and inferred entailments. An 'entailment' should exist if there is an inherent link or natural progression between the premise and hypothesis, regardless of the level of subjectivity in the information. Always justify and explain your decision in the end. Below, you will find a premise and hypothesis. Identify the relationship between them and choose either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' as your answer. Please provide your judgement alongside your chosen option at the end.

   reward: 0.7400 | Q: 0.7400 | uct: 3.3604 | cum_rewards: [0.74]
   prompt: For this exercise, you need to evaluate the connection between a given premise and a hypothesis. Your task is to determine if this connection is 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Pay special attention to the nature of information in both premise and hypothesis: direct assertions or possible assumptions made by any character about another's belief. Hypotheses may contain elements from the premise but do not automatically prove entailment. Beware of shifts in context such as changes in the messenger, or degree of directness of the information in both premise and hypothesis, since these may alter the original meanings or assumptions. It's equally important to consider the dynamics of second-hand information and its impact. Unpack each premise and each hypothesis, scrutinizing every element, like subjects, actions, and objects involved. Gauge the nature of the relationships - direct or indirect - between these elements, and note that similar content can carry different implications depending on their transmission pathway. Remember to analyze if subjective beliefs or second-hand input are presented as unquestionable truths. A true entailment suggests an unambiguous, factual relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, in which subjective beliefs do not intervene. In every step of your analysis, be meticulous, rationalize your choices carefully, and provide a comprehensive reasoning for your decisions. It is essential to be exact whether the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is straightforward or indirect. Now, evaluate the ensuing premises and hypotheses and decide their linkage, choosing either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.

   prompt: This task assigns you the role of an assessor responsible for delineating the relationship between a given premise and a hypothesis. Your choices to describe this relationship are either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. It is crucial to note that even though a hypothesis may encompass aspects of the premise, it does not axiomatically result in an entailment. Be vigilant about possible contextual shifts, which may include changes in the source of information, the depth or subjectivity of the information, or even the transformation of primary information into secondary or tertiary information. These shifts can effectively revamp the initial meanings or assumptions. Exercise careful judgement, taking into account the information flow, possible shifts in connotation and subtle changes in assumption levels. Thoroughly analyse all parts of the premise and the hypothesis, with due emphasis on subjects, actions, and objects involved. Evaluate the relationship they share — is it direct or indirect? The focus isn't merely on the content of the information, but also its originator and how far removed it is from the primary source. In instances of secondary information or subjective interpretations, assess whether they are presented as factual. Entailment implies a direct, factual correlation between the premise and the hypothesis, undistorted by personal beliefs. Always structure your judgement rationally and provide a comprehensive explanation of your decisions at the end. Clarify whether the observed relationship between the premise and the hypothesis is direct or indirect. Remember, indirect relationships or those obscured within another's understanding or belief can still imply entailment; care must be taken to identify such nuanced relationships. Now, apply this knowledge to the following premises and hypotheses to determine their relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. At the end, bracket your answer as <answer> and </answer>.

For example:
Premise: John believes that Mark thinks that a woman is in the kitchen. 
Hypothesis: John believes that a woman is in the kitchen.
Explain your reasoning and categorize this relationship as 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. 

This lays the groundwork for what entailment can entail, even in more layered or complex scenarios. Remember, the key is in the careful interpretation and in-depth understanding of the premise and the hypothesis.

Now, proceed to the actual task! Evaluate the premise and the hypothesis, settle on 'entailment' or 'non-entailment', and write your comprehensive explanation.

   prompt: Evaluate the provided premise and hypothesis, discern the logical interpretations within the given context, and ascertain if the hypothesis is a direct or indirect implication of the premise. In making your decision, consider the various possibilities and choose 'entailment' if there exists a reasonable path of inference from the premise to the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if the connection is neither direct nor can be logically deduced. For complex linguistic structures involving nested beliefs or knowledge, assume that a person's belief about another person's knowledge implies their own understanding of the situation. Justify your decision with an explanation. If the logical relationship is straightforward, a concise explanation will suffice; but for complex or abstract interpretations, a detailed explanation will be more appropriate.

Entailment is chosen when every situation in which the premise is true, the hypothesis is also likely to be true given contextual reasonability.
Non-entailment is selected when there exist situations where the premise can be true, but the hypothesis doesn't necessarily follow, even when following reasonable inferences.

Premise and Hypothesis example: Based on a premise stating 'John bought a pair of new sunglasses.', a hypothesis might be 'John has sunglasses.' Provide your analysis based on these instructions.

   prompt: With the given premise and hypothesis, apply critical reasoning to assess whether the hypothesis is an inevitable conclusion from the premise, choosing between 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Bear in mind that for an 'entailment' to occur, the truth of the premise must guarantee the truth of the hypothesis. When handling statements involving emotions, beliefs, or suspicions, recognize these are subjective experiences rather than objective facts. Be ready to identify logical implications or inferences from the provided statements, even when not explicitly stated. It's important to remember that specific situations can often be expanded to more general scenarios. In other words, knowing the specifics about an event could imply understanding of a broader concept. Lastly, be careful not to entrust too much in literal interpretations where the intended purpose of the statements can hint towards construable facts and inferences. Provide a brief justification of your choice when straightforward; however, explanations may require more detail when the logical relationships are complex or subtle. Always conclude by highlighting the final answer bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: Thoroughly analyze the context, verbs, and linguistic structures in both the premises and hypotheses. Be particularly attentive when handling subjective verbs, hypotheticals, or expressions of uncertainty such as "suspect", "believe", or "know". Acknowledge that these don't necessarily imply the truth or actuality of a proposition. Determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis or not. Remember, entailment does not require complete identicalness in phrasing but a deep semantic correspondence. The hypothesis should be an unavoidable conclusion of the premise. Look closely to both explicit and implicit information in the premise to determine if this implicates the hypothesis. After a meticulous analysis of all aspects, select 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. Provide a detailed rationale of your choice, ensuring it echoes your selection. Bracket your final choice between <answer> and </answer>, making certain it aligns with your detailed reasoning provided before.

Scrutinize the sequence of subjects, their beliefs, assumptions, knowledge, and how these influence meaning, especially when it converges to nested beliefs or intricate compound situations. Maintain a close eye on semantic details of verbs like 'learns' or 'believes'. Don't make automatic assumptions about the validation of the content of such beliefs or assumptions unless directly validated in the premise, and be aware that awareness of knowledge between different characters can differ. Be mindful that speculative or subjective matter in the premise does not automatically endorse the hypothesis. Weave a thread between the entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis to identify causality. Enumerate whether the premise encompasses the hypothesis or not. Avoid haste, but ponder the implications of each component within the context. Choose your selection from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' and elaborate on your reasoning process that guided you to this selection.

   prompt: Analyze the core events, actions, and objects described in the premises and hypotheses to identify the core relation between them. Understand that the order and structure of beliefs in the premise, including nested beliefs and complex scenarios, may not necessarily impact the entailment. Make a balanced consideration of the subjects along with the events they are related to, as a shift in the subject does not automatically lead to a 'non-entailment'. Validate speculative elements in the premise against the hypothesis, and remember that if the hypothesis constitutes a part of the occurred speculation, it could be entailed. Compare and contrast the events in both the premise and the hypothesis to establish causality. Determine whether the general event or situation depicted in the premise entails that in the hypothesis.

   prompt: Analyze the provided premises and hypotheses by strictly adhering to the textual information given. Utilize the subjects, verbs, and objects to decipher the context, and identify the link between the premises and hypotheses. Be careful not to introduce assumptions or beliefs not espoused in the text. Pay sharp attention to the causality between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis, but remember to acknowledge and interpret implicit meanings or situations presented in the text without adding speculative elements not supported by the text. Some actions or situations inherently include earlier steps, even if they are not stated in the text. Therefore, consider such sequences when assessing if the content of the premise leads to the content of the hypothesis. Remember that a premise involving the beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge of a subject does not always affirm the hypothesis. Particularly, distinguish between statements of suspicion and statements asserting certainty, as they are not equivalent. Upon careful consideration of all components of the provided scenario, choose 'entailment' if the premise necessarily results in the hypothesis, or 'non-entailment' if this is not the case.

   prompt: Analyze the indicated premises and hypotheses by focusing strictly on the given textual information. Consider the usage of subjects, verbs, and objects to understand the context fully, and determine the correlation between the premises and hypotheses. Avoid incorporating external assumptions or beliefs that aren't explicitly stated in the text. Closely observe the cause-effect relationship between entities and actions in both the premise and the hypothesis; avoid interpreting hidden implications or extending the context beyond its literal meaning. The goal is to ascertain whether the content of the premise unequivocally leads to the hypothesis. Be aware that person A's understanding, belief, or assumption about person B's thoughts or actions doesn't always mean that person B shares the same perspective or knowledge. In other words, the thoughts or beliefs of one person about another do not automatically affirm the hypotheses. A specific situation described in the premise does not necessarily extrapolate to a general context in the hypothesis unless there's a clear link. Take your time and scrutinize each aspect of the provided situation thoroughly, refraining from inferring anything beyond what's explicitly stated. Choose 'entailment' if you find the premise directly leads to the hypothesis. Opt for 'non-entailment' if the connection doesn't hold or seems indirect. Articulate your reasoning for your choice clearly. Conclude your response by enclosing your chosen answer between <answer> and </answer>.

   prompt: To discern the relationship between given premises and hypotheses, your task involves a delicate analysis of the textual information. Focus on the narrative structure by breaking it down into subjects, verbs, and objects, to grasp the underlying context. Ensure that this analysis stays within the scope of the given text and does not exceed to outside assumptions or beliefs. Pay keen attention to the causative mechanics of the actions and entities within both the premise and the hypothesis, while steering clear from hypothesizing about hidden meanings or additional contexts. Your objective is to evaluate whether the premise irrefutably leads to the content of the hypothesis. Be conscious that premises involving beliefs, assumptions, or knowledge do not always affirm the hypothesis. Exercise patience to meticulously weigh each element of the given scenario and refrain from making inferences that expand beyond explicitly stated information. In the light of your analysis, if it appears that the premise initiates the hypothesis, select 'entailment'. If not, opt for 'non-entailment'. In case of a premise involving characters, be cautious to confirm that the same characters are referred to in the hypothesis. If there is a shift in character, it generally may suggest 'non-entailment'.
