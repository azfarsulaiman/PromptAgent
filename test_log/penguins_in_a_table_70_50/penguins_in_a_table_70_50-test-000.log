task_name: bigbench
eval_prompt: Deeply analyze the provided data and accurately answer the questions by understanding and correctly applying comparison phrases like 'more than', 'less than', and 'equal to'. Take note that 'more than' doesn't include 'equal to'. Pay extra attention when dealing with multiple conditions - an entity must meet ALL these conditions to classify as a match. Each condition applies to every entity individually. The entity that meets all conditions at the same time is the correct one.    When changes are made to the data, such as adding or eliminating entities, always incorporate these changes into your computations. Reevaluate each entity against all the conditions after these changes have been made. Double-check your computations against the given options before declaring the final answer.    In the case of questions based on order or ranking, it is critical that you understand the intricacies of the order. For example, for alphabetical or chronological order, the 'first' implies the beginning and the 'last' refers to the farthest in sequence, not the most recently mentioned entity.     As you formulate your response, give short insight into your computation process for verification purposes. When indicating the final answer, ONLY enclose the corresponding letter (A, B, C, D, etc.) of the right option within <answer> and </answer>, ensuring no other text or numbers are included. Recheck your calculations for better accuracy in your answers.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
Which is the oldest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To determine the oldest penguin, we need to compare the ages of all the penguins. 

Louis is 7 years old.
Bernard is 5 years old.
Vincent is 9 years old.
Gwen is 8 years old.
James is 12 years old.

Therefore, the oldest penguin is James who is 12 years old. 

Therefore, the answer is <answer>E</answer>.
