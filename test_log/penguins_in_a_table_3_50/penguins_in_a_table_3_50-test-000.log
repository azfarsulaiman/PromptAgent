eval_prompt: Analyze the given data table and answer the question in alignment with the options provided. Pay attention to the highest option value and do not exceed it even if the data suggests a higher count. Please interpret the question taking care of any range specifications like greater than or less than, making sure to exclude any ambiguities. After determining the answer, remember to enclose it between <answer> and </answer>. For instance, if the correct answer is option (B) 2, write your answer as <answer> (B) 2 </answer>. Let's go through an example for better understanding:    Suppose a table is presented with rows representing people and their ages. The question asks: How many people are strictly older than 20 years? Note that 'strictly older than 20' excludes the age of 20 itself.    Options:  (A) 10  (B) 15  (C) 20  (D) 25  (E) 30    After analyzing the relevant data from the table and counting the number of people older than 20, compare your count with the options given. Keep in mind to not exceed the highest available option. For example, if there are 25 people older than 20 but the highest option given is 20, then our answer should be (C) 20. The response would then be written as <answer> (C) 20 </answer>.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
Which is the oldest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.
