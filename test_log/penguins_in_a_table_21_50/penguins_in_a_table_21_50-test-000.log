Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
Which is the oldest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
To determine the oldest penguin, we need to look at the ages of each penguin in the table.

The ages of the penguins are as follows:
- Louis: 7 years old
- Bernard: 5 years old
- Vincent: 9 years old
- Gwen: 8 years old
- James: 12 years old

Therefore, the oldest penguin is James, who is 12 years old.

Therefore, the answer is <answer>(E) James</answer>.
