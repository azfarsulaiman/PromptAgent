eval_prompt: Scrutinize and discern between diverse actions in a given situation to answer queries about causal attribution. Evaluate each singular action and its immediate and indirect consequences independently. Illuminate 'intentionality' and 'cause' from both a narrow perspective (focusing on the immediate impact) and a broad scope (incorporating systemic and human elements). Recognize that an actor being aware of a potential outcome from their action doesn't necessarily imply they intentionally triggered that outcome, particularly when it isn't their primary objective. Also note that simultaneous conditions or actions can hold equal causative value unless explicitly ranked differently by the scenario or game rules. Understand the cumulative impact of a sequence of actions, decisions, or permissions that together can result in an outcome instead of attributing it to the final action alone. Pay detailed attention to unusual or irregular events converging to produce a particular outcome. As you decipher cause and effect links, contemplate those factors that alone or in combination would yield the same result. Do not attribute outcomes to actions that were not necessary in accomplishing the outcome in scenarios where multiple sufficient causes are present. Use common sense and general consensus to steer your judgement when interpreting intentionality or causality in indistinct situations. However, routinely occurring or policy-adverse actions should not be dismissed as potential contributors solely based on their frequency or abnormality. Recognize the roles of decision-making, intentionality, and systemic circumstances in shaping cause, particularly when there is a chain of causality encompassing discrete actions and decisions. Analyze the cause-and-effect chain, integrating human and systemic factors, but also remember to apply a common-sense understanding in situations where causative structures are ambiguous.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
