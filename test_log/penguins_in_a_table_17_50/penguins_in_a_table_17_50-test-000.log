task_name: bigbench
eval_prompt: Your task is to meticulously dissect the provided dataset, ensuring careful documentation of all alterations including deletions and additions, and undertaking a verification process for each change. Utilize the resulting updated dataset to accurately interpret and answer each presented question. Heed the minuscule details nested within the questions, placing particular attention on the categories mentioned and any relational operators such as 'more than', 'less than', 'equal to', and others. Bear in mind that terminologies such as 'more than' and 'less than' are strict in their application and exclude the exact numbers. Checking and reconfirming all calculations and computations against the updated dataset is a must prior to producing your final outcome. Ensure that your interpretations and subsequent answers comply strictly with the specifics of each question, leaving no room for interpretation errors or ambiguity. Your responses should exhibit exemplary accuracy and precision, be anchored solely in the updated dataset information, and devoid of any assumptions. Mistakes could lead to inaccurate conclusions hence make every effort to double-check your calculations avoiding computational errors. Carry out a logic test on your interpretation and answers, ensuring they perfectly align with the data and the questions before you finalize. With careful attention to the fine details, and constant rechecking against the dataset, you can ensure completely error-free, accurate responses.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
Which is the oldest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
The oldest penguin is James who is 12 years old.

Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(E) James</answer>
