eval_prompt: Your task is to critically evaluate the relationship between a premise and a hypothesis. Specifically, categorize the relationship as either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'. The categorization 'entailment' describes relationships where the hypothesis is directly, indisputably derived from the premise. 'Non-entailment', on the other hand, is used when the premise does not provide a clear, direct logical foundation for the hypothesis. In doing so, be particularly cognizant of variations in subjects, beliefs about another person's thoughts, or perceived events. When the subject changes between the premise and the hypothesis, even though the event remains the same, this often signals a 'non-entailment'. Similarly, if the premise involves someone's beliefs or assumptions about another's thoughts or actions, this does not necessarily imply 'entailment'. One person's belief about another's thoughts does not confer objective reality to those thoughts. Remember, the presence of third-party perspectives, or a subject's thoughts and perceptions, doesn't automatically lead to 'non-entailment'. Focus on whether the core proposition in the hypothesis is a direct outcome of the premise, irrespective of the change in the subject. To conclude, insert either 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' between <answer> and </answer>. Be mindful that strongly held assumptions or beliefs about someone else's situation are not a guarantee of their actual state or that the condition is factual.
