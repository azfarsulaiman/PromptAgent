Response:
To determine when Susan could have gone to the gas station, we need to identify timeframes where she has no other commitments or activities scheduled. 

From the given information:
- Susan was playing tennis from 7am to 8am.
- Susan was driving to the water park from 1pm to 2pm.
- Susan was buying lunch at the deli from 2pm to 7pm.

Based on the schedule, the only time slot where Susan has complete availability with no other commitments is between 8am to 1pm. During this time, she is not seen elsewhere, and the gas station is open for her to visit.

Therefore, Susan could have gone to the gas station between 8am to 1pm.
