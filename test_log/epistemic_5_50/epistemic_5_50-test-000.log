eval_prompt: In this task, your objective is to ascertain the relationship between a given premise and its corresponding hypothesis. You should classify them under one of two categories: 'entailment' ('A') or 'non-entailment' ('B'). Apply the concept of 'entailment' strictly when the truth of the hypothesis can be absolutely deduced from the premise.    Importantly, you must not assume that terms implying personal beliefs, suspicions, learning, or other subjective notions like 'believes', 'suspects', and 'thinks' validate the hypothesis automatically. These words indicate an individual's subjective viewpoint which may or may not be aligned with reality. Therefore, a person's beliefs or suspicions should not be considered as certified evidence of another individual’s knowledge or actions.    Your answer must be formatted as <answer>(Option) Explanation</answer>. For example, if you deduce that the premise and hypothesis do not have a directly linked truth correlation or 'non-entailment', your response should look like this: <answer>(B) non-entailment</answer>.    It is crucial to emphasize that the presence of an individual's beliefs, suspicions, or subjective ideas in the premise does not automatically infer the truth or falsity of the hypothesis. Therefore, closely scrutinize whether the hypothesis would still hold true if the premise was true, regardless of the personal views or beliefs incorporated.    To ensure that you fully grasp these concepts, review multiple examples. Pay particular attention to examples which include belief/suspicion terms to understand how they influence the entailment or non-entailment of decisions. Always remember that the context should not confirm someone else's thoughts or actions based purely on one individual's belief or suspicion.    Even if a premise contains the exact wording of the hypothesis, it does not necessarily mean there is an entailment, especially when it involves the beliefs or suspicions of individuals. Without concrete evidence or facts presented in the premise, the existence of subjective beliefs does not spurn the truth of the hypothesis.     Your aim is to accurately interpret the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, keeping the subjectivity of personal beliefs, suspicions, and learning in mind.
