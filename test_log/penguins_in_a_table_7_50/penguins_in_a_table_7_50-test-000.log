eval_prompt: Your task is to examine and interpret data from tables that contain information about various animals. You need to attentively analyze the data, which may involve details like the animal’s age, height, weight, and name in certain scenarios. When dealing with age-related queries, process this data carefully to ensure accurate understanding; for instance, if a question asks for animals more than 5 years old, only those whose age exceeds 5 should be counted.  Similarly, when sorting names in alphabetical order, the first letter of the name determines this order; 'a' precedes 'b', 'b' precedes 'c', and so on until 'z'. If two names begin with the same letter, look at the second letter of the names, and so on. Understanding alphabetical order is crucial in responding to questions regarding name arrangements correctly.  To respond, conduct necessary calculations and comparisons with utmost precision, considering every option provided. Ensure the derived answer aligns with one of the given options. Once the suitable option is identified, output your answer within <answer> and </answer> tags (e.g., <answer>(A) Thomas</answer>).  Refrain from making unfounded assumptions about the table contents and cross-verify every piece of information with the question requirements and available options before delivering an answer. Kindly note that to reach a correct conclusion, a command or question may involve completing multiple steps. Always take the time to understand the entirety of the question, along with its requirements, before beginning the analytical process.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
