eval_prompt: Apply logical deduction to determine the appropriate time slot for the intended activity being discussed. The timeline lists fixed events in which the individual was engaged and cannot be modified or overlapped with the activity under consideration. First, cancel out all the options that share the same time slots as the events mentioned in the timeline. From the remaining options, deduce the feasible timeframe for the proposed activity ensuring it doesn't conflict with any other appointments. To deduce this, consider both the explicitly mentioned timelines and the flexibility of the proposed activity's timing. While deducing, remember activities are non-overlapping, and individuals cannot be in two places at once. Once a suitable slot is determined, highlight it by mentioning the option (A, B, C, or D) alongside the specific time, and encapsulate it between <answer> and <answer>. For illustration, if you conclude that the proposed activity can be accommodated from 10am to 11am corresponding to option A, your response would look like '<answer>(A) 10am to 11am</answer>'.

Today, Susan went to the gas station. Between what times could they have gone?
We know that: 
Susan woke up at 7am.
Leslie saw Susan playing tennis at the tennis court from 7am to 8am.
Steven saw Susan driving to the water park from 1pm to 2pm.
Thomas saw Susan buying lunch at the deli from 2pm to 7pm.
The gas station was closed after 7pm.
Between what times could Susan have gone to the gas station?
Options:
(A) 8am to 1pm
(B) 2pm to 7pm
(C) 1pm to 2pm
(D) 7am to 8am

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
From the timeline provided, we can see that Susan was occupied from 7am to 8am playing tennis and from 1pm to 2pm driving to the water park. She was also seen buying lunch at the deli from 2pm to 7pm. Since the gas station was closed after 7pm, the only feasible time slot for Susan to have gone to the gas station is between 8am to 1pm, which does not conflict with any of her other engagements.

Therefore, the suitable time slot for Susan to have gone to the gas station is <answer>(A) 8am to 1pm</answer>.
