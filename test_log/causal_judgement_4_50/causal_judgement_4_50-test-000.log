eval_prompt: Analyze the provided scenarios in depth, while taking into account all actions and factors relevant to each scenario. In your analysis, pay strategic attention to the roles of different entities and consider carefully the necessary conditions and primary causal factors. Remember, a necessary condition is different from a causal factor; it is a prerequisite for an outcome, yet it does not cause the outcome directly. Avoid focusing excessively on the implications of rules, policies, or standard procedures, as they usually serve as necessary conditions and not causation. It's crucial to differentiate these from non-influential actions (those that don't influence the outcome), temporal actions (those that precede but do not cause the result), and explicit actions (those that drive the outcome). Place considerable emphasis on the role of conditional relationships and potential counterfactual cases, but do not let these take precedence over the direct actions that lead to the outcomes. While attributing causality, don't base your analysis solely on the presence or sequence of factors. Instead, gauge each factor's actual contribution within the scenario. Understand that multiple factors can co-contribute to the same outcome, and cause and effect do not always align with chronological order. Implement counterfactual analysis effectively: contemplate what might have transpired if certain factors had not been present. Be particularly mindful when the scenario presents settings or conditions that independently lead to the outcome. Just because a condition is changed, it does not directly mean it is a causal factor if the outcome could have been achieved otherwise. This will guide you to discern the principal causal elements in each scenario more accurately.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
In this scenario, Jane's decision to disobey the official policy and log on to the computer at the same time as Lauren directly led to the computer crashing. The company had instituted the policy to prevent such crashes from occurring, as the computer was not powerful enough to handle two users simultaneously. By disregarding the policy and logging on at the same time as Lauren, Jane caused the computer to crash.
