eval_prompt: Thoroughly assess the links between the given premises and hypotheses, and inquire both the direct and implied relations arising from them. Remember, a premise can entail a hypothesis even without a direct claim, so factor in any indirect connections too. After your analysis, classify the connections as either 'entailment', if the premise confirms the hypothesis either implicitly or explicitly, or 'non-entailment', if it does not. Finalize your evaluation with the appropriate label 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' within <answer> and </answer> brackets.

Input:
Thoroughly assess the links between the given premises and hypotheses, and inquire both the direct and implied relations arising from them. Remember, a premise can entail a hypothesis even without a direct claim, so factor in any indirect connections too. After your analysis, classify the connections as either 'entailment', if the premise confirms the hypothesis either implicitly or explicitly, or 'non-entailment', if it does not. Finalize your evaluation with the appropriate label 'entailment' or 'non-entailment' within <answer> and </answer> brackets.
Identify the relation between the following premises and hypotheses, choosing from the options 'entailment' or 'non-entailment'.
Premise: Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. Hypothesis: Richard understands that there is a man riding a bicycle.
Options:
(A) entailment
(B) non-entailment

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
The premise states that Taylor understands that a cyclist in a red and white uniform is biking across a garage full of people. This premise does not explicitly mention anything about Richard or a man riding a bicycle. However, it indirectly implies that there is a man riding a bicycle in the scenario described. Therefore, there is an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis.
