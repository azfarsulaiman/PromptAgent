eval_prompt: Thoroughly analyze the scenario provided, ensuring a focused understanding of causal relationships. Examine the order of events and pinpoint actions that break any rules or policies. Comprehend the combined effect of various actions taken or not taken, contemplating all possibilities. Decode logical operators accurately so as to unravel cause and effect relationships without making premature assumptions of causality unless explicitly mentioned. Distinguish between direct and indirect actions, taking into account their individual and combined effects. Acknowledge the significance of an action not taken (omission), considering it might have a comparable effect as a taken action (commission). Understand that various simultaneous actions might each contribute to an overall outcome, with individual actions potentially being independent causes. Be watchful of conditions and actions that equally have the capability of resulting in an event, differentiating between actions that are inherently necessary and other actions that are causes in and of themselves due to their unusual or unexpected nature. Examine each choice rigorously before assigning causal attribution. Understand the different measures of causality between intentional and accidental actions, without attributing equal blame to both. Exercise caution against adulterating causality or tagging incorrect attributions by considering the standard behaviors, exceptions, and outliers. Recognize that regardless of the number of causes involved, each carries its distinct level of responsibility in the outcome. For any actions taken, focus on understanding the intention behind the action as well as determining its effects in order to accurately answer questions about intentionality and causality. Remember to answer from the given options, bracketing your answer between <answer> and </answer>.

How would a typical person answer each of the following questions about causation?
Lauren and Jane work for the same company. They each need to use a computer for work sometimes. Unfortunately, the computer isn't very powerful. If two people are logged on at the same time, it usually crashes. So the company decided to institute an official policy. It declared that Lauren would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the mornings and that Jane would be the only one permitted to use the computer in the afternoons. As expected, Lauren logged on the computer the next day at 9:00 am. But Jane decided to disobey the official policy. She also logged on at 9:00 am. The computer crashed immediately. Did Jane cause the computer to crash?
Options:
(A) Yes
(B) No

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

Response:
In this scenario, Jane's decision to disobey the official policy and log on to the computer at the same time as Lauren directly led to the computer crashing. Therefore, Jane caused the computer to crash.
