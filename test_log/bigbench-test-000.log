I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 5 penguins in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <E>5</E>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

The model's input question asks, "How many penguins are there in the table?". The model's response is incorrect (predicting: A) while the correct answer is E (5 penguins in total).

Reason:

1. The model may have not correctly counted the number of lines that correspond to each penguin in the table. It might have potentially excluded the new entrant, James, inaccurating the count to 1 instead of 5. 

2. Another reason might be that the model did not fully understand the conceptual part of "add a penguin to the table". It might not understand that adding another penguin increases the total number of penguins in the table.

3. The model might also be confused by the information provided in the example at the beginning ("the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.").

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that each row after the header corresponds to a different penguin. Therefore, the total number of penguins is equal to the number of rows not including the header.

2. Be explicit on what "adding a penguin to the table" means for the total count.

3. If the examples given before the addition of new penguin are not related to the final question, consider removing them to avoid potential distraction or confusion. 

4. At the end of the prompt instead of just asking to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer>, specify that the alphabet corresponding to the correct answer needs to be bracketed. 

5. To avoid confusion, ensure the examples given in the exercise are coherent with the questions being asked.

Wrong Example 1: 

In this example, the model did not interpret the prompt correctly. The prompt specifies "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes." However, the model included information from the giraffe table in answering the question. 

The problem occurs because the prompt was not clear enough in specifying that the model should only consider the penguin table. Because it was posed with two tables - one for penguins and one for giraffes - it used information from both. So even though the answer is found in the context of only considering the data from the penguins, which amounts to 4, the model erroneously looked at the data from both animal types while answering. 

This is why the model's prediction ended up being (C) instead of the correct answer.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model also misinterpreted the question. This time though, it’s due to the language model misunderstanding what "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" means.

The prompt was clear on considering the giraffe table, but the model interpreted the question as asking who’s the last giraffe in the list when sorted in alphabetical order, hence it answered Donna, whereas the correct answer should be Marian.

How the prompt can be improved:

1. Clearly specify which data set to be used when answering the questions - this is especially useful when more than one table is present. The prompt could specify "using only the penguins table, answer the following question" to clarify which information to consider.
   
2. Introduction of instructions or hints for potential language ambiguity in questions. For the second wrong example, the prompt could specify, "consider sorting the giraffe names in alphabetical order and answer who would be last as per this sorting".

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

The model's input is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

How many animals are more than 5 years old?
Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 7 animals that are more than 5 years old: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is <(C) 7>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The question was about sorting the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and picking the last one. The correct answer should be (C) Marian, as when sorted alphabetically, Marian comes last. 

However, the model selected (D) Donna, which indicates that the model failed to sort the data alphabetically and seems to have only considered the spatial ranking of the giraffes.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) Absence of Explicit Instruction: The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to perform sorting operations based on the parameters given in the questions. While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.

gradient:
<1> 

The model's input question asks, "How many penguins are there in the table?". The model's response is incorrect (predicting: A) while the correct answer is E (5 penguins in total).

Reason:

1. The model may have not correctly counted the number of lines that correspond to each penguin in the table. It might have potentially excluded the new entrant, James, inaccurating the count to 1 instead of 5. 

2. Another reason might be that the model did not fully understand the conceptual part of "add a penguin to the table". It might not understand that adding another penguin increases the total number of penguins in the table.

3. The model might also be confused by the information provided in the example at the beginning ("the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.").

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that each row after the header corresponds to a different penguin. Therefore, the total number of penguins is equal to the number of rows not including the header.

2. Be explicit on what "adding a penguin to the table" means for the total count.

3. If the examples given before the addition of new penguin are not related to the final question, consider removing them to avoid potential distraction or confusion. 

4. At the end of the prompt instead of just asking to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer>, specify that the alphabet corresponding to the correct answer needs to be bracketed. 

5. To avoid confusion, ensure the examples given in the exercise are coherent with the questions being asked.

In this example, the model did not interpret the prompt correctly. The prompt specifies "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes." However, the model included information from the giraffe table in answering the question. 

The problem occurs because the prompt was not clear enough in specifying that the model should only consider the penguin table. Because it was posed with two tables - one for penguins and one for giraffes - it used information from both. So even though the answer is found in the context of only considering the data from the penguins, which amounts to 4, the model erroneously looked at the data from both animal types while answering. 

This is why the model's prediction ended up being (C) instead of the correct answer.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model also misinterpreted the question. This time though, it’s due to the language model misunderstanding what "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" means.

The prompt was clear on considering the giraffe table, but the model interpreted the question as asking who’s the last giraffe in the list when sorted in alphabetical order, hence it answered Donna, whereas the correct answer should be Marian.

How the prompt can be improved:

1. Clearly specify which data set to be used when answering the questions - this is especially useful when more than one table is present. The prompt could specify "using only the penguins table, answer the following question" to clarify which information to consider.
   
2. Introduction of instructions or hints for potential language ambiguity in questions. For the second wrong example, the prompt could specify, "consider sorting the giraffe names in alphabetical order and answer who would be last as per this sorting".

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The question was about sorting the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and picking the last one. The correct answer should be (C) Marian, as when sorted alphabetically, Marian comes last. 

However, the model selected (D) Donna, which indicates that the model failed to sort the data alphabetically and seems to have only considered the spatial ranking of the giraffes.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) Absence of Explicit Instruction: The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to perform sorting operations based on the parameters given in the questions. While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.

While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 5 penguins in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <E>5</E>.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

The model's input question asks, "How many penguins are there in the table?". The model's response is incorrect (predicting: A) while the correct answer is E (5 penguins in total).

Reason:

1. The model may have not correctly counted the number of lines that correspond to each penguin in the table. It might have potentially excluded the new entrant, James, inaccurating the count to 1 instead of 5. 

2. Another reason might be that the model did not fully understand the conceptual part of "add a penguin to the table". It might not understand that adding another penguin increases the total number of penguins in the table.

3. The model might also be confused by the information provided in the example at the beginning ("the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.").

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that each row after the header corresponds to a different penguin. Therefore, the total number of penguins is equal to the number of rows not including the header.

2. Be explicit on what "adding a penguin to the table" means for the total count.

3. If the examples given before the addition of new penguin are not related to the final question, consider removing them to avoid potential distraction or confusion. 

4. At the end of the prompt instead of just asking to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer>, specify that the alphabet corresponding to the correct answer needs to be bracketed. 

5. To avoid confusion, ensure the examples given in the exercise are coherent with the questions being asked.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

In this example, the model did not interpret the prompt correctly. The prompt specifies "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes." However, the model included information from the giraffe table in answering the question. 

The problem occurs because the prompt was not clear enough in specifying that the model should only consider the penguin table. Because it was posed with two tables - one for penguins and one for giraffes - it used information from both. So even though the answer is found in the context of only considering the data from the penguins, which amounts to 4, the model erroneously looked at the data from both animal types while answering. 

This is why the model's prediction ended up being (C) instead of the correct answer.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model also misinterpreted the question. This time though, it’s due to the language model misunderstanding what "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" means.

The prompt was clear on considering the giraffe table, but the model interpreted the question as asking who’s the last giraffe in the list when sorted in alphabetical order, hence it answered Donna, whereas the correct answer should be Marian.

How the prompt can be improved:

1. Clearly specify which data set to be used when answering the questions - this is especially useful when more than one table is present. The prompt could specify "using only the penguins table, answer the following question" to clarify which information to consider.
   
2. Introduction of instructions or hints for potential language ambiguity in questions. For the second wrong example, the prompt could specify, "consider sorting the giraffe names in alphabetical order and answer who would be last as per this sorting".

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 4 penguins in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <(D) 4>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: D.

<2> 
The model's input is:

Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is Donna. 
Therefore, the answer is: <answer>(D) Donna</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The question was about sorting the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and picking the last one. The correct answer should be (C) Marian, as when sorted alphabetically, Marian comes last. 

However, the model selected (D) Donna, which indicates that the model failed to sort the data alphabetically and seems to have only considered the spatial ranking of the giraffes.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) Absence of Explicit Instruction: The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to perform sorting operations based on the parameters given in the questions. While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.

gradient:
<1> 

The model's input question asks, "How many penguins are there in the table?". The model's response is incorrect (predicting: A) while the correct answer is E (5 penguins in total).

Reason:

1. The model may have not correctly counted the number of lines that correspond to each penguin in the table. It might have potentially excluded the new entrant, James, inaccurating the count to 1 instead of 5. 

2. Another reason might be that the model did not fully understand the conceptual part of "add a penguin to the table". It might not understand that adding another penguin increases the total number of penguins in the table.

3. The model might also be confused by the information provided in the example at the beginning ("the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.").

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that each row after the header corresponds to a different penguin. Therefore, the total number of penguins is equal to the number of rows not including the header.

2. Be explicit on what "adding a penguin to the table" means for the total count.

3. If the examples given before the addition of new penguin are not related to the final question, consider removing them to avoid potential distraction or confusion. 

4. At the end of the prompt instead of just asking to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer>, specify that the alphabet corresponding to the correct answer needs to be bracketed. 

5. To avoid confusion, ensure the examples given in the exercise are coherent with the questions being asked.

Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

In this example, the model did not interpret the prompt correctly. The prompt specifies "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes." However, the model included information from the giraffe table in answering the question. 

The problem occurs because the prompt was not clear enough in specifying that the model should only consider the penguin table. Because it was posed with two tables - one for penguins and one for giraffes - it used information from both. So even though the answer is found in the context of only considering the data from the penguins, which amounts to 4, the model erroneously looked at the data from both animal types while answering. 

This is why the model's prediction ended up being (C) instead of the correct answer.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model also misinterpreted the question. This time though, it’s due to the language model misunderstanding what "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" means.

The prompt was clear on considering the giraffe table, but the model interpreted the question as asking who’s the last giraffe in the list when sorted in alphabetical order, hence it answered Donna, whereas the correct answer should be Marian.

How the prompt can be improved:

1. Clearly specify which data set to be used when answering the questions - this is especially useful when more than one table is present. The prompt could specify "using only the penguins table, answer the following question" to clarify which information to consider.
   
2. Introduction of instructions or hints for potential language ambiguity in questions. For the second wrong example, the prompt could specify, "consider sorting the giraffe names in alphabetical order and answer who would be last as per this sorting".

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The question was about sorting the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and picking the last one. The correct answer should be (C) Marian, as when sorted alphabetically, Marian comes last. 

However, the model selected (D) Donna, which indicates that the model failed to sort the data alphabetically and seems to have only considered the spatial ranking of the giraffes.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) Absence of Explicit Instruction: The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to perform sorting operations based on the parameters given in the questions. While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.

gradient:
<1> 

The model's input question asks, "How many penguins are there in the table?". The model's response is incorrect (predicting: A) while the correct answer is E (5 penguins in total).

Reason:

1. The model may have not correctly counted the number of lines that correspond to each penguin in the table. It might have potentially excluded the new entrant, James, inaccurating the count to 1 instead of 5. 

2. Another reason might be that the model did not fully understand the conceptual part of "add a penguin to the table". It might not understand that adding another penguin increases the total number of penguins in the table.

3. The model might also be confused by the information provided in the example at the beginning ("the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.").

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that each row after the header corresponds to a different penguin. Therefore, the total number of penguins is equal to the number of rows not including the header.

2. Be explicit on what "adding a penguin to the table" means for the total count.

3. If the examples given before the addition of new penguin are not related to the final question, consider removing them to avoid potential distraction or confusion. 

4. At the end of the prompt instead of just asking to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer>, specify that the alphabet corresponding to the correct answer needs to be bracketed. 

5. To avoid confusion, ensure the examples given in the exercise are coherent with the questions being asked.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

In this example, the model did not interpret the prompt correctly. The prompt specifies "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes." However, the model included information from the giraffe table in answering the question. 

The problem occurs because the prompt was not clear enough in specifying that the model should only consider the penguin table. Because it was posed with two tables - one for penguins and one for giraffes - it used information from both. So even though the answer is found in the context of only considering the data from the penguins, which amounts to 4, the model erroneously looked at the data from both animal types while answering. 

This is why the model's prediction ended up being (C) instead of the correct answer.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model also misinterpreted the question. This time though, it’s due to the language model misunderstanding what "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" means.

The prompt was clear on considering the giraffe table, but the model interpreted the question as asking who’s the last giraffe in the list when sorted in alphabetical order, hence it answered Donna, whereas the correct answer should be Marian.

How the prompt can be improved:

1. Clearly specify which data set to be used when answering the questions - this is especially useful when more than one table is present. The prompt could specify "using only the penguins table, answer the following question" to clarify which information to consider.
   
2. Introduction of instructions or hints for potential language ambiguity in questions. For the second wrong example, the prompt could specify, "consider sorting the giraffe names in alphabetical order and answer who would be last as per this sorting".

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The question was about sorting the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and picking the last one. The correct answer should be (C) Marian, as when sorted alphabetically, Marian comes last. 

However, the model selected (D) Donna, which indicates that the model failed to sort the data alphabetically and seems to have only considered the spatial ranking of the giraffes.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) Absence of Explicit Instruction: The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to perform sorting operations based on the parameters given in the questions. While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.

I'm writing prompts for a language model designed for a task.

My current prompt is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.

But this prompt gets the following examples wrong:

<1> 
The model's input is:
Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
How many penguins are there in the table?
Options:
(A) 1
(B) 2
(C) 3
(D) 4
(E) 5

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 5 penguins in the table. 
Therefore, the answer is <E>5</E>.

The correct label is: E
The model's prediction is: A.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
<1> 

The model's input question asks, "How many penguins are there in the table?". The model's response is incorrect (predicting: A) while the correct answer is E (5 penguins in total).

Reason:

1. The model may have not correctly counted the number of lines that correspond to each penguin in the table. It might have potentially excluded the new entrant, James, inaccurating the count to 1 instead of 5. 

2. Another reason might be that the model did not fully understand the conceptual part of "add a penguin to the table". It might not understand that adding another penguin increases the total number of penguins in the table.

3. The model might also be confused by the information provided in the example at the beginning ("the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.").

Ways to improve the prompt:

1. Make it clear in the prompt that each row after the header corresponds to a different penguin. Therefore, the total number of penguins is equal to the number of rows not including the header.

2. Be explicit on what "adding a penguin to the table" means for the total count.

3. If the examples given before the addition of new penguin are not related to the final question, consider removing them to avoid potential distraction or confusion. 

4. At the end of the prompt instead of just asking to bracket the answer between <answer> and </answer>, specify that the alphabet corresponding to the correct answer needs to be bracketed. 

5. To avoid confusion, ensure the examples given in the exercise are coherent with the questions being asked.

gradient:
Wrong Example 1: 

In this example, the model did not interpret the prompt correctly. The prompt specifies "Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes." However, the model included information from the giraffe table in answering the question. 

The problem occurs because the prompt was not clear enough in specifying that the model should only consider the penguin table. Because it was posed with two tables - one for penguins and one for giraffes - it used information from both. So even though the answer is found in the context of only considering the data from the penguins, which amounts to 4, the model erroneously looked at the data from both animal types while answering. 

This is why the model's prediction ended up being (C) instead of the correct answer.

Wrong Example 2:

In this example, the model also misinterpreted the question. This time though, it’s due to the language model misunderstanding what "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order" means.

The prompt was clear on considering the giraffe table, but the model interpreted the question as asking who’s the last giraffe in the list when sorted in alphabetical order, hence it answered Donna, whereas the correct answer should be Marian.

How the prompt can be improved:

1. Clearly specify which data set to be used when answering the questions - this is especially useful when more than one table is present. The prompt could specify "using only the penguins table, answer the following question" to clarify which information to consider.
   
2. Introduction of instructions or hints for potential language ambiguity in questions. For the second wrong example, the prompt could specify, "consider sorting the giraffe names in alphabetical order and answer who would be last as per this sorting".

3. In general, the prompt could also provide a clear and consistent format for the language model to follow. This would help the model know exactly what to look for when analyzing the data from tables to derive an answer. 

4. Another potential enhancement would be to use more precise language in the question. For example, instead of using "the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order", use "the giraffe whose name would come last if sorted in alphabetic order". This could help reduce ambiguity and improve model performance.

gradient:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

Options:
(A) 5
(B) 6
(C) 7
(D) 8
(E) 9

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
There are 7 animals that are more than 5 years old: Louis, Bernard, Vincent, Gwen, Jody, Gladys, and Donna. Therefore, the answer is <(C) 7>.

The correct label is: A
The model's prediction is: C.


Based on these errors, the problems with this prompt and the reasons are:
<1>
Question: How many penguins are there in the table?
The model answered with the count of penguins before the addition of 'James', because the prompt didn't clearly state that the model needs to consider modifications or updates to the table. 

<2>
Question: What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
In this case, the model answered incorrectly because the prompt does not specify that the questions can be about something other than penguins. The model was designed to answer questions about a table of penguins, so it didn't pay attention to the table of giraffes.

<3>
Question: How many animals are more than 5 years old?
The model made a mistake because the prompt doesn't state that the questions could encompass both tables. As the prompt was focused solely on penguins, it improperly interpreted the task and included only penguins in the response.

To improve the prompt based on these examples:

1. Make it clear that the questions can relate to possible changes or updates to the initial information or data.
2. State directly in the prompt that questions may be about different types of animals, not just penguins.
3. Specify that the questions might encompass all tables and their data provided in the text, and not just one. 
4. Adding a general introduction to the tasks such as interpreting tables, sorting data, counting instances, etc., may guide the model through a broader range of questions.
5. The prompt can also remind the model to consider all the options given before making a prediction. 

A revised version of the prompt may look like this:

"Analyze and interpret tables about different animals and their attributes, including penguins. This task may require sorting data, counting instances, taking into consideration modifications to the data, and comparing across different tables. The questions will relate to one or more tables provided in the text. Consider all the information and options before providing an answer."

There are a list of former prompts including the current prompt, and each prompt is modified from its former prompts:
(0) Answer questions about a table of penguins and their attributes.


Based on the above information, please write 1 new prompt following these guidelines:

The task might involve sorting table data, taking note of changes or updates, dealing with multiple tables simultaneously, and performing comparisons. Remember, the queries can pertain to any animal table given within the text, and might require you to analyze the entire table data. Consider all available options before formulating your final response.
Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410

What is the name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order?
Options:
(A) Jody
(B) Gladys
(C) Marian
(D) Donna
(E) Louise

At the end show the answer option bracketed between <answer> and </answer>.

The model's response is: 
The name of the last giraffe sorted by alphabetic order is:
(D) Donna
<answer>(D)</answer>

The correct label is: C
The model's prediction is: D.


For each wrong example, carefully examine each question and wrong answer step by step, provide comprehensive and different reasons why the prompt leads to the wrong answer. At last, based on all these reasons, summarize and list all the aspects that can improve the prompt.
gradient:
1) Wrong Example Analysis:

The question was about sorting the names of the giraffes in alphabetical order and picking the last one. The correct answer should be (C) Marian, as when sorted alphabetically, Marian comes last. 

However, the model selected (D) Donna, which indicates that the model failed to sort the data alphabetically and seems to have only considered the spatial ranking of the giraffes.

Reasons for Incorrect Answer:

a) Absence of Explicit Instruction: The current prompt does not explicitly instruct the model to perform sorting operations based on the parameters given in the questions. While it mentions sorting as part of the potential task, it does not make it clear that this could involve sorting item names alphabetically.

b) Lack of Clarification: The prompt does not clarify what to do when a question requires ordering or arrangement based on certain criteria. As a result, the model might have misinterpreted the question.

c) General Instructions: The instructions in the prompt are given in a broad sense and not actionable steps. The model could incorrectly interpret the instruction because its complexities are not broken down for the model to follow.

Ways to Improve the Prompt:

1) Specify Operations: Indicate that tasks may involve data sorting or arrangement, including alphabetical or numerical order, and specify that the model should pay close attention to the ordering requirements in the question.

2) Actionable Instructions: Give actionable instructions and specify that the model should sequence the steps one by one before formulating a response. Mention that when a question asks for the ‘last’ in an order, it might not necessarily refer to the last mentioned in the original data.

3) Improved Clarity: Make the prompt clearer to specify that the model must thoroughly analyze questions and sort the data accordingly.

So, the improved and more clear prompt would be:

Interpret and respond to questions regarding tables containing information on various animal species, and their corresponding traits. Pay close attention to the underlying requirements of each question, which may involve sorting of data alphabetically or numerically, analyzing updates, comparing data from multiple tables, and attending to finest details such as last or first in an ordered list. Ensure to sequence your operations, thoroughly analyze the entire data table given in the text, and consider all available options before formulating your final response.
