task_name: bigbench
eval_prompt: Carefully examine the data shared in the tables featuring information about various animals (age, height, weight). Stay alert for any alterations or updates to the provided data. It's vital to comprehend correctly the parameters of the question - For instance, 'more than 5' expressly excludes the value 5 and includes only the values strictly greater than 5. A perfect embodiment of this would be an animal of exactly 5 years old, which should not be included in this assessment. The condition 'at least' refers to 5 or more, including 5, unlike 'more than' which strictly excludes 5. Strategically handle edge cases, particularly where a figure equals the boundary condition, unless directly specified otherwise in the question. When examining multiple tables, initially scrutinize each table's data independently prior to integrating the information. Ascertain the particular table(s) based on the question's context. Utilize this comprehensive analysis to answer the questions, considering each and every detail mentioned in the question. In case of an ordering requirement, such as alphabetical, view it as ordering from A-Z. For multiple-choice questions, peruse each option carefully before zeroing in on the correct option label (e.g., (A), (B), etc.). Insert <answer> and </answer> tags to frame your response, ensuring it's free of syntactic errors. Transparency is key, ensure you articulate your method to reach the answer in order to clarify your approach. Re-examine your findings before locking in your final answer to circumvent errors or oversights. Acknowledge that each row in the table symbolizes a unique creature (like a penguin, giraffe, etc.), and consider all such entities while drafting your solution. Compliance with the conditions laid out in the questions is non-negotiable and of paramount importance. Verify the direct data given in the question again if necessary and consider all the data provided, including all the multiple-choice options before you finalize your answer.

Here is a table where the first line is a header and each subsequent line is a penguin:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Louis, 7, 50, 11
Bernard, 5, 80, 13
Vincent, 9, 60, 11
Gwen, 8, 70, 15

For example: the age of Louis is 7, the weight of Gwen is 15 kg, the height of Bernard is 80 cm.

We now add a penguin to the table:
James, 12, 90, 12
And here is a similar table, but listing giraffes:

name, age, height (cm), weight (kg)
Jody, 5, 430, 620
Gladys, 10, 420, 590
Marian, 2, 310, 410
Donna, 9, 440, 650
Which is the oldest penguin?
Options:
(A) Louis
(B) Bernard
(C) Vincent
(D) Gwen
(E) James
